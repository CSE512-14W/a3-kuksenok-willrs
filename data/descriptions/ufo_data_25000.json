(Leader, one on right and three on left). I was surprised that they were so easily observed at night. Then they were gone. I walked around the corner of the building to see if I could see them and nothing to see. Then it dawned on me that they covered an arc of view (~ 50 degrees) in about 5 seconds. Also dawned on me that the formation was perfect and the illuminated bottom of the birds was too perfect.(My initial surprise was .. Ghee, I can see a flight of geese at night.) The rate of airspeed had to be in excess of 500mph or faster. The size of each bird was the same as the width of my fingertip at arms length.  I see lots of flights of geese past here but not that fast. The AF jets showing off for the USAF Academy don&apos;t cover that much sky. No noise. No change of image. I don&apos;t know what I saw but it wasn&apos;t a flock of geese.Upon reflection, I believe they were shaped like isosceles triangles, perhaps individual ones or maybe iso triangels on the bottom of one big thing I couldn&apos;t see.Whatever it/they were, they initially struck me as a flock of geese. Oh, the winds at altitude weren&apos;t great enough to allow a flock of geese to go that fast because the clouds just weren&apos;t moving.

It had blue, red, and white lights flashing at various times.  It was a mile to two miles high.  It made no noise.  It was not seen on the Tri-State Airport&apos;s radar in Huntington, WV. or Indianpolis Center radar.Follow up investigation: Mr.A.(name on file for privancy reasons), states that on the evening of the sighting he was headed for his garage.  He looks up and spots the light.  He goes on into the garage and when he comes back out he looks again and sees the light is still there. He first thought, it was a helicopter out near the atomic plant but then thought that it may be near the Portsmouth Regional Airport which is about 6 miles from his location.  He stated that this was in the east to southeastern skies. He began to think that a helicopter was flying towards him because he saw one large very bright light which is what a helicopter would look like if coming head on.  However, this object seemed to barely move if at all at times.  It seemed to hover in the same altitude of approx. 5-6 thousand feet up. To him it seemed there was blue and red with the white light somehow together, dimming and then getting brighter. Mr. A. called on his family to come out and look at the light.  All memebers in the family were curious as to what it could be.  His son looked at it through a telelscope and said that he could not make out what it was because it was too large and bright when veiwed through magnification. Mr. A. then called the Ohio Highway Patrol Post about 5 miles away.  The person he spoke to said there was a hill right oustide and they doubted they could see anything.  Mr. A. says he does not think they even looked because he did not hear back from them even tho he asked they let him know if they saw anything. They did not go to look while he was on the phone either. About 15 minutes later he called the Portsmouth Regional Airport and spoke to the base operator.  He did not get any names from whom he spoke with.  He asked to be connected to the control tower stating that he was a pilot.  Not getting connected he then called the tower directly.  The tower operator told Mr. A. that they had nothing on radar of an unusual nature.  The tower operator asked Mr. A. if he saw a plane, to which Mr. A. said yes. This was to test to see if the radar was working properly.  That was all that was seen on radar. Then Mr. A. looked in his airport directory book and called the Huntington Airport.  They also said nothing unusual was seen on their radar.  He also tried calling Indianpolis.  Nothing was found unusual on their radar. During the time he was on the phone the light vanished. Mr. A. says that it had been in veiw for over an hour.  I asked Mr. A. if it could have been a star or planet? Mr.A. said that he is very familair with the stars and planets in that part of the sky and also that he watches planes coming from the airport all the time.  He was adamant that it was not a star or planet. He also says that he knew it was not a satelite or meteor because of the slow if at all movemment. Comments: I commend Mr. A. on his determination to find out what the source of the light was! He sounded sincere in his story. He sounded puzzled by what he had saw and the family members did not know what it was.  They were just as puzzled. It has come our attention here at Ohio MUFON that over the past year several unidentified lights and objects have been reported in the near vicinity of Lucasville, Ohio.  Some of these locations are: Proctorville, Chesapeake, Rome, Wheelersburg and several from Portsmouth, Ohio.  We also have had reports from Huntington, WV.  In 2003 we had an upsure in sightings from these areas.

We arived shortly after 5 pm and I was in the house with my Inlaws. My son came in and asked me what that is in the sky. I looked up and was astoniced to see 6 lights to the east of kingsport. I hollered to my Brother and sister inlaw  to come out. The biggest and brightest was like pollised gold was at the 5 o&apos;clock of the moon with the mid sized one which was green to the left of it and the red grape sized one to yhe left of it. They made a triangle with pee sized blue lights to the right and bottom and left of them. We watched for several minutes as the blue lights moved. The bottom one came up to the right of the left blue light and the right blue light cme over to the gold light which was the size of a grapefruit. Then the blue light from the right begin to move around the gold light and then to the top of it. I asked if they had a vidio camera and they didnt. I realized that I had An digital camera in the car and went to get it. I took several pictures and decided to call wjhl tv to ask if they had any reports. I was given to the weather  room and told the Man what I was looking atand he said he would go and see if he could see them. He hung up and we kept watching.Then my son aked me what the white Cigar shape was . I was stunned to see another object comeing from the east to the north west. Over the trees and begin to take more pictures.As I was looking at this object My sister inlaw told me to look up. When I did ,It was another cigar shape moveing from the east to the south west. I tied to get a picture of it too,but it was moveing to fast. As was the first.

They left such a deep and disturbing impression that I still think about them from time to time, as I have never heard an adequate explanation.  I discovered this website while searching for something, anything that might have come to light in the intervening years, and felt compelled to add my account, as it includes some additional items that I haven&rsquo;t seen reported by anyone else. On the evening of March 13, 1997 I was camping just outside of Prescott, AZ, in the forest near Hidden Valley Dr.  There was a campsite nearby that was closed for the season, but my tent was outside of the campground area, on a hill I would estimate to be about a half-mile from Highway 89. Just after 8:00 PM, I noticed several lights in the sky off to the West-Northwest.  I assumed at first that they were airplane lights, as they seemed to be the usual colors of red, green, and white, but they seemed to be moving somewhat erratically (hovering and bobbing in the air), and I got the impression there was something generally weird about them.  The colored light they were casting seemed to project in much stronger beams than I have ever seen from an airplane, and they seemed to be rotating and changing colors from a common source, rather than the clearly separate lights that airplanes have.  I recall that there were two of these objects, but there may have been more that I dismissed as airplanes before noticing the oddness of the lights. At around this same time, I saw first two, then three lights off in the trees to the Southwest.  At first I had thought they were the eyes of an animal, God only knows how I could have thought that, but then I noticed the third light, and also noticed that they seemed to be pulsating, growing dimmer and brighter by turns.  These lights appeared to be very low to the ground, somewhere amongst the trees and evidently some distance away. As all this was going on, and I was getting generally freaked out, while I was looking in the direction of the red/green/white lights, I saw a chevron formation of five very bright white lights appear out of the West-Northwest sky.  This formation banked towards the South, and flew directly overhead.  I was observing this from just inside the tent, with the opening facing Northwest (I was already pretty badly frightened by this point, and had gotten into the tent for security), so I lost sight of them after they passed overhead.  I cannot really make a decent guess as to their altitude, or how fast they were moving--from the time I saw them to the time they passed overhead was less than half a minute, so I had the impression they were moving pretty fast, and at the time (having seen them from a great distance off) I assumed they were at high altitude, but descending as I watched.  My impression was that they were five separate objects, although they remained in perfect formation when they performed the banking maneuver.  I believe these particular lights passed over at around 8:15.  They made absolutely no sound. This brief sighting of five lights flying in a &quot;V&quot; was my only glimpse of what is now called the &quot;Phoenix Lights.&quot;  For several hours, however, I continued to observe a number of strange things in the sky, including the red/green/white lights, several lights that I would have thought were stars if they had not been moving in jerks and starts in random directions, and at one point what appeared to be a circle of orange light (pretty much the color of fire) passing through the sky from East to West, also without any sound.  I was so exhausted that night that I eventually fell asleep despite all the bizarre things in the sky.", "strange array of lights suddenly appear  about 1/2 mile in front of my truck, in Brooksville Florida.I was traveling west on Ayers Rd, in Brooksville, Florida about 3 miles east of the RR crossing, I was the only vehicle on the road at the time, I had my cruise control set at 55MPH, had my hi-beams on, all of the sudden these red lights appeared on the road ahead of me about a half mile away,  it was very odd the pattern of red lights  didnt match any vehicle that I was familiar with. I first thought this is huge what ever it is, it covered both lanes, about 30 ft wide and about 20 ft high with the one lone light on the other lane (east bound) was flashing.  As I got closer, I slowed down, turned off my high beams, I realized this moving  object is not a vehicle, I could see the trucks passing north and south on US41 through the lights, all of the sudden as I got closer about 400 feet away these lights all vanished in different directions, and the red lights went off simuntaneously...as they scattered. this all lasted about 5 to 10 minutes.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone at length on two occasions, and we found him to be quite objective and serious-minded.

It hovered silently underneath a cloud and then moved slowly Westerly for maybe 10 km and then again remained stationary.

I have an account I would like to share with you. I live just 30 miles south of Huntsville and have seen some strange objects in the sky where I live. Since you listed the pilots reports about some of their strange sightings I would like to share with you what I saw one winter eve. On Feb. 10, 1999 that night at 8:15 p.m. central I was outside enjoying the clear skies and beautiful stars evident in the winter months. I was watching what appeared to be a commercial airliner traverse the skies from south to north towards Huntsville. As the airliner got to approx. 45 degrees above horizon while I was fixed watching it, suddenly a brilliant white &quot;star&quot; like object (round and approx. 4-8 feet in diameter) just appeared out of nowhere above and behind the airliner. It just blinked on and was at a estimated distance of perhaps 5-8 miles in the planes 9:00 position. The light was motionless (for maybe .2-.3 second) after appearing then it zoomed down to the planes port side to a distance of approx. 1/4 mile away from the planes wing and the same apparent altitude. Once it reached this position it paced along the left side at the same speed as the airliner. I ran inside and got my wife and kids to come and watch as the object remained along side the plane until out of sight. The amazing thing about this incident was the objects speed. I&apos;ve since given thought and some calculations as to the speed the object moved. Since looking into the vastness of the space makes it difficult to determine exact distances but speculating distances and time the object traveled I surmised the object was at least 5 miles and possible as much as 8 miles away (assuming the airliner was at a typical altitude of between 28,000-32,000 ft. as a reference of distance from object to plane) and took only .3-.4 second to make up the distance that would equate to a velocity of between 45,000 to 96,000 mph. Pretty amazing to watch an object go from zero to 96,000 mph in an instant. The area where I live has in the past been a hot bed of UFO activity. One world known event occurred in Fyffe AL (1991 I think) where a cylindrical object was seen by hundreds of people including friends of mine. The object hovered over pastures where cattle mutilations were found the following day. One of my friends watched one eve coming home from work as it hovered and maneuvered slowly over a wooded area near Blountsville AL and shined a brilliant red beam to the ground. The next day the area was taped off with yellow tape and a crew resembling a bio-hazard team was scouring the area. I have done some research into older cases that date back to the early forties and before. One was a coworker of my wife that saw a disc shaped object hovering above their farms pasture. Once the man (a boy of 10 at the time) approached the object it instantly disappeared. He described it as metallic brushed aluminum color, 40&apos; in diameter and 10-12 feet thick as a perfect disc shaped and top/bottom equidistant from the center edge. This occurred in 1942. Another incident dating to 1938 where another acquaintance and a buddy was deer hunting in eastern Tennessee and saw a large disc craft between two mountains as he described &quot;down in a deep hollow&quot; move slowly below mountain peeks as if searching for something (wildlife?). I tried to shake him in his conviction to see if he would stick with his story and he told me &quot;so help me God we saw this......and we didn&apos;t tell anybody for a long time.&quot;  I am convinced that our government knows more than they are sharing. Thanks for your time. Thank you to the witness for this wonderful report.

This event actually occurred on an UNKNOWN DATE in 1995, but believed to be in cooler weather, perhaps the autumn, as it was getting dark about 1900 hours.  At the time of the investigation, this writer was serving as Chief Field Investigator for MUFON of Georgia and as an investigator for ISUR.  John Thompson of Lagrange Georgia was State Director for MUFON at that time and also on the ISUR Board.  The multiple witnesses were all Georgia residents of that area, and attended the same church.  The occasion leading to the event was a church trip to Anniston Alabama by this small group of church ladies.  They were being driven in a large van by a male member of the congregation who was a prominent local businessman, and also known as a trusted community leader in that African-American neighborhood.  Accounts vary, but there may have been 10+ total witnesses on this trip, this investigator interviewing 6 of them.  This harrowing account was held confidential by these witnesses for about 2 years, only being discussed among their small group of friends.  Eventually, the information was related to John Thompson in his Lagrange office, and he asked this writer to follow up on it.  Investigation   15May97, this FI began by interviewing the Primary Witness (PW) at her home in Lagrange.  She was found to be a 62 YOA retired Nurses Assistant.  She lived in a well kept home in an older, established neighborhood, with many family photos and signs of serious religious faith being obvious.  PW stated that on the night in question, she and her church friends were riding up to nearby Anniston Alabama to play bingo.  They were seated to the rear of their friend, the van driver, and as usual talking and having a nice ride, enjoying the nice clear weather.  (Note......the driving route was determined as follows; west out of Lagrange and across the adjacent state line into Alabama, then turning north on Alabama Hwy 431 which carries them to I-20 which is about 35-40 miles distant to the north. Anniston is near the intersection of Alabama Hwy 431 and I-20).  As the van approached the vicinity of Wedowee Alabama on Hwy 431, the witnesses decided to roll up all of the windows because of the poultry plant located just off the highway (Braswell&apos;s Farms).  PW indicated that the odor of the production there was pretty strong, and this was something they normally did enroute to Anniston.  As the van approached and passed the plant, PW and some others noticed what they thought was a large new light over the top of the building (which is located on a rise).  It was large enough that they commented on it being newly installed.  One witness stated that it WAS NOT a light, but some &quot;FLYING THING&quot;.Another witness commenting that no, it was just a new light. Then the other witness replying something to effect of &quot;Well if that&apos;s so, HERE IT COMES&quot;!   The light flew down from over the plant and approached the moving van and then began to pace it as it drove north.  The light was described as being round like a globe, about the size of a &quot;dishpan&quot; in diameter (bigger than a basketball).  The light was described as being &quot;yellowish&quot;, with the brightness of a lightbulb or street light.  It continued to pace the van, with descriptions of the light varying it&apos;s distance and altitude to as low as about 12 feet and then back up to 100 feet or treetop level; as close (and closer) as appx. 50 feet and backing away to perhaps 75 yards.......sometimes over the van, sometimes beside it, but always pacing it.  This episode began near Wedowee on Hwy 431 which, at this point in the route, is about 25 miles south of I-20 and the Anniston vicinity, their destination.  During this wild ride, the ladies became FRIGHTENED, trying to get down below the window level and still taking an occasional peek.  The driver stated that he was trying to drive and look at the same time which he found difficult. He verified that the light appeared to be about 100 feet over the poultry plant before it swooped down and began following them.  He added that eventually he DID IN FACT think about some form of UFO due to having read such accounts. Adding that it was definitely a large globe of light.  During this ride up to I-20, the PW at one time saw what she described as a shape within the light, a shape very similar to a &quot;human embryo&quot;, which she indicated in her sketch. Further that it seemed to be &quot;moving around&quot; within the light. At another point, she recalled something like a beam projecting out that hurt her eyes, and those of her friend.  Adding that they both later developed watery and sore eyes. Another witness did not describe a beam, but told of a &quot;sparkling effect.  Another witness described a &quot;bad glare&quot; that beamed through the window.....just suddenly clicking on.  This activity continued as the van moved northwards closer to I-20, passing through the small Alabama &quot;hill country&quot;.  At one point, the vehicle drove through an underpass, finding the globe of light waiting on the other side.This light also demostrated terrain avoidance maneuvers and continuously adjusted it&apos;s speed to that of the van.  As this group finally reached the area of the intersection of Hwy 431 and I-20, the light flew off over a field, then accelerated steeply upwards, leaving a streak, then became the size of a star and vanished.  A hoax was ruled out in this matter due to the sincerity of these witnesses and their strong church background.  Considered was glowing plasma/spook light, helicopter, and advanced military recon drone.  These were ruled out.......this writer does not believe ANY kind of natural &quot;plasma/spook light&quot; would act as described......over so many miles.  Even though it was during darkness, the van was approached SO CLOSELY that a helicopter or drone fuselage would have been observed, as well as engine noise heard.  A spokesman for the mainly rural Randolph County Sheriff&apos;s Department recalled no similar reports from that time period and knew of nothing that might be related to this event.  During this investigation, there were only the normal differences noticed from witness to witness, due to their personal interpretation and recall, seating position within the van, and level of fright. This writer classified the event as a SIGNIFICANT UNKNOWN. This FI also believes that there may have been more evidence in the offing if there had been a timely report of this event.  The witnesses are not to blame.  They were found to be good southern folks, that did not know whom to contact at the time.

I went outside the arena with my mother and a friend of hers. We walked to a coffee shop about 1/2 mile away. While on the way back, we all noticed a very bright light in the sky. It was a cool clear night in mid-March. The object was extremely bright. It sort of was going straight and slow for about 20 seconds, then made a very sudden turn to the right. It suddenly stopped after a few more seconds. It was quite high up it seemed - 2-3 miles? At that point, several smaller lights or objects - I counted at least seven, emerged from the light and were flying around the still stationary larger object. The objects eventually made their way across the sky away from view. Total time - about 2-3 minutes. We were all quite puzzled by the event. On a side note - I remember we were talking with my mom&apos;s friend and her husband a few weeks later when they were over for dinner. He told us when he was with the US military in the early 1970&apos;s, he was a radar operator responsible for an area in the US mid-west. He used to track objects on the screen flying at extreme speeds - but he was also warned to ignore them and to keep his mouth shut. He was convinced from our descriptions, that what we saw was definitely not a normal aircraft.

It was in the early evening &amp; it was just light enough to see it; we had climbed the ridge before &amp; found an old WWII lookout bunker up there; on the other side is a rural coastal road &amp; a bay; it was a dark shade of no color,quiet, w/lights around its perimeter; seemingly defying gravity; I did not report it in fear of being labelled a &quot;kook&quot;; however, the next day sightings were reported on the other side of the island on TV news. We lived there for 20 years &amp; that was the only time I heard of actual sighting. I now believe in ufo&apos;s, although I suppose our military could have been testing something new, but is was definitely not a plane; from our view it looked like a giant cigar in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I noticed 4 jets flying in formation what looked to me in the northern sky over Interstate 10, from the west to the east.  Three were in line with each other but the lead was clearly ahead of the others. My guess is that they were 30,000 feet or more in altitude, all 4 leaving contrails, and were spaced about 3000 feet apart. Everything was normal and I signaled to my friend, &quot;Hey, look at those planes&quot;  He said, &quot;Yeh, gotta be the military flying in that kind of formation.&quot;  They were absolutely identifiable as jets. Then he noticed the lead aircraft had a shiney sphere under it and said &quot;can you see that under the lead plane?&quot;  I said &quot;Wow! That&apos;s amazing. I never could say I saw one until today!&quot; It was about half the size of the lead jet aircraft. He ended by saying they are probably heading to Eglin AFB, FL.  What really proved it to me is that the sphere was definately shiney, made no contrail (like the jets did) and was separate and aside the lead plane.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  However, we believe that the possibility of military aircraft would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the sighting may have been of a genuine UFO.

They had a dark purple glow, and didnt move for a period of five minutes or more. We were at the Orchard Training Area which is about 10 miles SW of Boise.

After staring at it for a few minutes, we agreed we saw red and blue lights flashing along with the white light, but it did not appear to move. It seemed to fade and brighten, and appeared to be spinning in place. After watching a few other aircraft in the area, one of which kept changing direction, we were certain it was not an aircraft. After wacthing for about 10 minutes we went inside, waited another 10 minutes and went outside. It had moved lower in the sky, but in relation with the moon and stars.

He was a radar operator at Brunswick Navy Air Station from 1954-58.  The guys that were on watch called everyone over.  They said we have been watching this for a few minutes.

The other Doppler {The best at the time} went from up to down.  Up it maxed out at 150K. He said they watched the aircraft move across and then it went staight up and up, right off the radar.

Shortly afterwards it changed into a more round or oval shape and came to a complete stop. As the witness watched the object traveling along over Pauline Mountain it flashed an extremely bright blue light. The object did this a couple of times and what came next surprised the lady. She clearly was able to see a ring of blue lights which ran horizontally around the center of the object. The woman reported there were a large number of lights, and said it was hard to estimate how many. But she figured there had to be a dozen or more. She was able to observe the object for approximately 25 minutes. As it moved slowly further away the lady lost sight of it. The lady said it grew smaller and dimmer in size due to the distance away until it disappeared. She grabbed her video camera and ran outside, but she explained at this time into the sighting the object was already at a good distance away and she failed to get any footage. The witness did mention that if she&apos;d thought of the camera at the time of the sighting she was confident that she&apos;d have been able to film it. No sound was heard.

It was too far away to see a shape but it was very bright.  We could see what looked like a red light manbe once every 5 minutes or so.  The light was eratic in movement but generally moved to the North over an hour until we lost sight of it above the trees to the north west of our house.  It was a very clear night and the stars were quite bright, but not nearly as bright as the object.  We called my girl friends father who lives 9.5 miles SSE of our location and it was clearly visable to them also.  It could have easily been the sun (which had set) reflecting off an object drifting to the north, but it was very bright and low in the sky.

July 31, 1984, I know date because I&apos;d just left my parents&apos; house in Newtown after watching CBS&apos;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; with Mom &amp; Dad, and a movie...10 pm...I passed exit 16, the sky was misty &amp; rainy ... rounded a curve, saw a bright light coming in from my right (directly over the airport, heading east with me and descending fast)...it came over some trees, I saw it thru the windshield. My first thought: airplane about to circle around and go to the airport. It crossed my windshield as I started up a 25-degree grade toward the South St. bridge, a large Arch Bridge over 84 with a police tower adjacent to the bridge. As I was driving toward the bridge, the object &quot;Stopped instantly on a dime&quot; directly over the bridge, in front of me. For 1 second, my thought was &quot;oh! a VTOL (Vertical Take-Off or Landing Aircraft....Jets used usually on ships in the Navy)then after 1 second, I instantly realized it was a UFO! I was driving right AT IT! My heart came up into my mouth, as I realized I had seconds to decide if I could turn around, but the median there wouldn&apos;t allow it, I would&apos;ve gotten stuck. I then decided to &quot;floor it&quot; and go right under it. Then I decided this might be the only time I might ever see one, so I forced myself to pull over. I watched it for 15 mins. It was about double the size of a 2-story house. It appeared to me to be shaped like a tetrahedron, with one upper side cut out of it. Many lights, different colors, all over it, about 20 lights, looked like typical Christmas tree lights, including purple, yellow, red, blue, green, white. As I pulled over, it was perfectly still over the bridge, was VERY low, and after a few mins it moved over very slowly to the tower and hovered there. I felt like I was DEFINITELY being watched, and was totally terrified. My body was violently shaking like I was cold, it was hard to control my shaking. The ter! m &quot;deer in headlights&quot; crossed my mind. I saw cars and trucks going by, and I have a photograph in my head of a split second shot of two people going by me at 60 m.p.h. and looking up at the UFO. The object was so low, I had the feeling that if I had a baseball, I &quot;just about&quot; could have hit it. Definitely could have with a sling-shot. The object was rotating slowly, and I unrolled my window. All I heard was crickets when there were no cars. I had a 1-Million candle-light power super flashlight plugged into my cigarette lighter, next to my right knee on the passengers&apos; side floor and it crossed my mind to fire a light on this thing, and I &quot;just could not&quot; get up the will to do it, I started shaking more just thinking about it. I was cursing myself for not having my camera bag, I am a photographer - hobbyist, and usually carry it with me. I could see what appeared to be a large &quot;hole&quot; in the darkness behind the lights, and a definite grill-work pattern with pipes and such along the bottom, and smooth sides, but it was hard to see from the brightness. I remember being amazed thinking &quot;this was NOT made on this planet!&quot; The object very slowly moved away from the tower, traveling directly over 84 West opposite me, then after passing me picked up speed. I didn&apos;t move at first. I looked into my rear-view mirror, saw it, then carefully opened the door, stood up and put my elbow on the car roof, and watched it disappear over the horizon toward Southbury and Newtown. I then drove down the hill to exit 17, called my parents and I remember waking my Dad. I told him what I&apos;d seen, we discussed it for a few mins., then I went home to my Waterbury apartment. I sat down in the dark at my kitchen table, looked out the window, watched the light from Waterbury coming in the window ....and sort of daydreamed about the whole incident for a bit...then I looked at my watch and it was 3:30 am !! I do not know if I had a missing time episode or not. I did call Oxford airport, but I don&apos;t recall if it was that night or the next ! morning. My Father is now deceased, so I can&apos;t ask if he remembers what time I called him. My Mother does not remember the episode...I don&apos;t know if she woke up or not when I called. I was a disc-jockey at a Waterbury radio station at the time, and I asked the audience a few nights later if they&apos;d seen anything...I received about a dozen phone calls, one I remember particularly about a couple who saw one on the Merritt Parkway the same night. At the time, I had no clue that there was a &quot;Hudson Valley&quot; UFO flap going on.", "I t was 3:18 pm on Valentines day that I have witnessed an object in the sky. I am in Brooklyn. I realize that this is Valentines Day, and the object may be passed off as a silver valentine balloon, however it seemed to be very high in the sky. It was travelling left to right with out any movement caused by wind. I noticed it for 10 seconds. A balloon I would think would be tossed a great deal but this object seemed to be in control of it self. It looked like a silver circle. Shortly afterwards, I would say about 30 seconds I saw an aircraft in the sky close to the area with smoke trails and the orb was not to be found. I had left for 20 seconds to grab my binoculars to get a better look, because my telescope would be too time consuming. I would have to line up the spotter scope first, then look through the lens and i know for a fact that I would lose the orientation of the orb.

I went to our balcony to get a better view with my husband and we watched it for over twenty min together. I had gotten my digital camera before I went to the balcony and took five photos of the object.  It seemed like the color was changing to brighter then dimmer as a result I expect from heat? There was a dark purple haze spinning around this sphere of light. It kept moving in the same vicinity slightly upwards, downwards, side to side. I returned to bed continuing to watch (my husband went downstairs)and it slowly descended behind the mountains.I downloaded the pictures from the camera and they came out showing an enormous yellow and red starburst type aura.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at a celestial body, possibly Sirius.

While doing so i noticed an unsual set of lights high in the sky at some distance, being near a flight path normally this would be assosciated with being a plane, however the object did not move in any direction, just sort of hovered, and was far to high to be a warning light on a tower. After going back inside i called on my brother (12) to come have a look to see if he saw the same as me. The lights were still stationary. I ruled out it being a plane as it stayed in this position  for around an hour, after a while of watching i went away from the window and later went back (bout an hour and half after originally seeing it, the light were no longer there). The object consisted of a bright white light that spanned the breadth of the object, with blue and red flashing lights, the white light also appeared to flicker. The next night was Tues 24th, i normally go out drinking with all the people from work on a tues and it was around twenty past ten and i went to wait on my bus at the road behind my house to go into town to meet them. In the sky in a near position to the night before was the same light patttern, i watched for around ten minutes while waiting on my bus, again there was no directional movement of the object. After getting on the bus i couldnt see it from the bus, i mentioned it to my mates but they just laughed. This night however the object seemed bigger than before only slightly, indicating it was a bit nearer this time. Tonight (Wednesday 25th February) i was working in the next village at the Burger King, and around half ten i was taking some rubbish bags out to the skip at the rear of the shop, on my return i could see again a similar formation of lights in the sky, much clearer than before, but still at some distance, being directly under the flight path now i had to wait to check for movement, again no significant motion just hovering! , i shouted the other two workers from inside hte shop to look, both agreed there was the white light spanning the breadthe with red and blue flashing lights, but immediatley dismissed it as a plane. I told them to come back in ten minutes, and it would still be there. Sure enough ten minutes later it still was. However they just laughed at me and said &quot;haha how do ya think its a ufo? haha&quot;. When bein driven home i continued to watch the lights, when home i again asked my brother (12) to come look, but also my mum and other brother (18) to come look, all agreed that it was very unusual. We al looked through a monocular (best of what was at hand) i had it focused on the light, there seemed to be a saucer like shape with white light round the rim, and red (and some blue) flashing lights. It had a hovering motion.

It looked like going down to earth in a South-West direction, I lost it behind the houses, awaiting a big crashing noise but nothing at all. I first saw It at about the same altitude as commercial planes usually fly when they are on approach to the Airport, it happened so quickly that it is really hard to be precise with the altitude but this is what I remember. I decided to go to the back road of Ottawa Airport since the ball was seen going toward it. No sign of the event but a few cars driving around the airport in the same direction. I&apos;m sure lot of people saw it, this is a very clear night, crystal clear with a few light clouds floating quickly pushed by the strong wind. I&apos;m sure the Airport radar caught it and the Canadian Forces station Letrim too, these two being very close from the place we were at the moment. Two big commercial airplanes size of a Airbus 320 arrived at the moment I was on the airport back road Letrim and there were some more on approach from a distance.

The object had many lights around the spaceship looking object and one larger and brighter light in the center.  It did hover for adleast two hours but moved slowly.  AT times it would move quickly and seem to maybe try to camouflage itself by blowing up or getting much larger.  I must say i have never witnessed such a remarkable item in my life.

Furthermore, and this is going to sound even more bizarre, the trails seemed to almost like form clouds or attract clouds or something.  Because as I was passing through the Sepulveda pass I noticed that they kind of aggregated together in a &quot;cloudlike&quot; mass - not smokey like, but feathery like a cloud. In final I would like to note that some trails seemed to begin mid sky - with no faded trail prior to where the observed trail began - as if it, perhaps, came in from a very high altitude (or, I suppose, turned on the &quot;jets&quot; mid sky).((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness was looking at contrails behind high-flying jet aircraft.

It was leaning to the right as if it was in the kickoff position.  It looked as if it was the smoke of a plane but the definition was too detailed on both ends.

It was around 1:20 AM, when for some apparent reason, I decided to turn my head slightly to the left, and I noticed a Green &quot;Flame&quot; traveling downwards towards the Earth. It seemed like an eternity, but it lasted for about 3-5 seconds. It was not zipping by, but it was not floating either, it simply looked as though it was falling down from the sky.

I lost sight of it after it went behind the trees, and it went out of my field of view. I related it as looking most like a Firework &quot;Dud&quot; falling back down. It was so brilliant. I don&apos;t recollect hearing any noise though. I talked to a NASA Astronomer however, and my second assumption seems to fit best. It was a Meteor/Meteorid in my view. I was so shocked though, simply because I didn&apos;t know they came in such fantastic colors. I always thought of them as being Yellow/Orange/Red. According to the Astronomer, it was made up of Nickel. Nickel apparently burns in a Green Color when mixed with Oxygen, and a little Nitrogen, or better put, the Atmosphere.

It was too bright to be a balloon (this was 1am) and 2. it was moving too fast.I stayed and looked at the sky for about 2 minutes after it was out of sight and right before I went in saw what looked like a military surveilance plane flying overhead (It looked like one and wasn&apos;t using the normal commercial flight paths).Oh! one more thing...The object (unlike planes that fly in the area) didn&apos;t make any noise.", "Triangle Shaped UFO, Red Green Blue Lights Underneath, Los Angeles, March 2004Been seeing strange lights in the sky lately, over past two weeks, so I have been paying extra attention. This night, saw triangle shaped UFO, just hovering.  No lights on, so I knew it was not a plane.  Making a motor sound, similar to but not quite like a helicopter.  But it was not any type of helicopter we know of.  Seeing it from underneath, it was clearly shaped like a triangle and had 1 red, 1 green, and 1 blue light in triangle formation. I pulled over my car, put the hazards on, got out and looked straight up.  Seconds after I did this, the thing sped off really fast and the RGB lights seemed to shut off.", "Bright reddish-orange light southeast of the city phased on and off in an inconsistent north-to-south-to-north again  pattern.Saw a bright, artificial light (relative in terms to the stars) in the sky southeast of the city. On first sighting it &quot;turned on&quot; for about 3 or 4 seconds, holding, then phased out. Approximately 3 seconds later it flared again, but more to the south, in the same manner as it did before. About 15 seconds later it flared again, but more to the north. The light was orange-red in color. Other aircraft were observed in the vicinity of the light. It should be noted that Nellis AFB is approximately 150 miles to the north, while Luke AFB is about 200 miles to the east.The light was not a shooting star, as it exhibited no like patterns.I don&apos;t claim that the object was a UFO or a craft of any type, but it was inconsistent with anything else I&apos;ve seen, and I&apos;ve lived in the open West near airforce bases and missile testing facilities nearly all my life.

Unfortunately I wasn&apos;t wearing my watch but feel quite certain it started before midnight, on the 27th. Something about hearing it was 11:30 as I left the Grey Creek hall to lay on the beach and star gaze. Grey Creek is north of Creston on highway 3A. It started in the northwest looking like northern lights. No color, just white light glowing in sort of horizontal bands. One and then a second a bit higher. Then the bands merged into one and sank lower on the horizon. Then a few small vertical slashes forming above and to the north of the white glow. Then it got interesting when a fatter vertical beam began to rise out of the glow, low over the horizon, but it was no longer perfectly vertical it was leaning over to the south. Sort of about 15 degrees leaning to the left. I thought that was unusual. It looked a little weird too as it got brighter and more defined. And then expanded right across the sky, in only a few seconds! At arms length it was about two fingers wide. Perfectly straight and exactly the same intensity from one horizon to the next, and at an angle from the northwest to the southeast. I guess it could have looked cylindrical as some witnesses claimed. I didn&apos;t look two dimensional at all. More like a big fat nasty chemtrail with a light on inside. Now I will guess that it lasted for about 15 minutes without any changes until it got a bit fatter and duller and the sharp edges began to dissolve somewhat and become blurry with little shards of light coming off it almost like it was spinning glowing particulate off of itself. Then it bent! It curved into a graceful arc to the north and stayed like that for a few minutes before snapping back to a straight line, then continuing to become duller until it faded out completely leaving absolutely no sign of itself or the northern lights it seemed to grow from. I&apos;m 43 yrs and have been a sky watcher my whole life and have never seen anything like this before, and I&apos;ve seen some strange things believe me. I&apos;ve seen lots of weird lights flying about, something in the daytime that looked like a giant pair of broken scissors and lots of really unbelievably strange clouds. Oh yes and the chemtrails with little white orbs traveling through them too. I hope I&apos;ve been some help. I live in Nelson and your welcome to phone me if you like at:  Thanks Brian and good luck with your work,  Another Report:  Hello,  I was just reading Rense.com and ran across the article about the sightings on July 27, 2003. That night I was doing sound tech work at a festival 20 min. east of Kamloops. At about 2:00 am I looked up in the sky and saw a green beam from horizon to horizon. At first I thought it was the aurora borealis but it barely moved and kept it&apos;s orientation for the two hours I observed it. My friend who was also there thought it might be some sort of chemtrail activity, or maybe a Harrp test from up in Alaska. It is the strangest thing I have ever seen. thanks  Another Report:  Hi there. I just read your letter to the editor in the August 15th edition of the Capital News of the Okanagan, Seeking Witnesses to UFO. I can&apos;t be sure of the exact date, but July 27th sounds about right. I live on the Westside shore of Okanagan Lake, in Kelowna. Around the time of night you describe, I took my dog out for his walk before bed, nothing different than most nights. But as I was standing outside our fence, I noticed up in the sky, a pale horizontal beam of light, extending from the west to the east, and sort of fading beyond my sight. I live close to the hillside, so it appeared to originate from the other side of the hill, maybe in Westbank. It caught my attention because it reminded me of how years ago when they opened a grocery store up in Westbank, they had rented one of those Hollywood style spotlights, and we had seen those shining all the way over where we live. But what I saw this night wasn&apos;t as bright, nor was it panning around as one of those Hollywood ones does. I was actually going to go inside and e-mail my friend who lives on the other side of the hill and ask him if any place on his side was having a celebration that he knew of, but I dismissed it because it seemed so pale. My other thought I decided it might be a contrail showing up vaguely from a jet that had passed in the night. Now reading your description, I&apos;m wondering if it was the last bits of the same beam of light seen by people in Houston. It was definitely stationary, but not prominent enough that I was able to view any rotation or black shadow within it. I&apos;d certainly like to know if anyone else in this area saw the same thing, and I&apos;m wishing I had told my friend about it that night!  Another Report:  I read your newspaper article about unexplained sightings on July 27/28. We have lake property at Lake Koocanusa and we are located just 5 miles from Jaffray. Between about midnight and 1:30 a.m. July 28 my daughter, son-in-law, son, daughter-in-law and myself were star gazing. We get our lounge chairs out each night and just enjoy the night sky. We first spotted a bright light in the north western sky moving in a zig zag motion. It then just disappeared like it went out. Then we saw a very large beam of light. At first we thought it was northern lights but it wasn&rsquo;t in the right area. This large beam of light was still there at 1:30 when we went to bed. ( We are always joking that the UFO&apos;s are going to land because I have 28 solar lights along a 500&rsquo; beach frontage.)  Another Report:  Dear Brian Vike  I live in Vernon BC. I live in an apartment facing west to the airport in Vernon, Davis Farm is on my right and the army camp is on my left. I was reading the statements about the strange light over Kimberly. ON that night I was on my balcony watching the one ray of Northern light touch on the hill behind Davis Farm. It did not behave like a northern light. It did not oscillate, nor dance or drape like a curtain. It seemed to just slightly waver on the top of the hill and remained in one form. The direction it came was from behind and the left which is southeast. Again not a northern light. It remained the same intensity of light which reminds me of concentrated moon light. It broke and one piece remained straight and the long line started to curl up and back around like a three quarter figure eight. I am a born skywatcher and I am glad now to have a place to record these unexplainable events. There is allot of activity around Vernon.

I was walking home from Boy Scouts on a monday night when I saw an object above me.  It was about fifty feet over the tree tops.  For about three blocks the object was slightly  behind me.  As I turned right onto my street the object did not follow any longer.  No one except for me was on the street.  I then ran into my house. Watching TV in my sun room I saw it again outside of the windows.  Then later, I went upstairs to my room to go to sleep.  I felt that something was outside so I pulled back my curtins.  The same object as before was about fifty feet above my neighbor&apos;s house across the street.  I then remember going to sleep. The next day at school I asked the class if they had seen anything weird the night before. A couple of people said that they had seen a strange object.  These classmates were from my eastside neighborhood.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There were a few scattered fair weather clouds floating by, but for the most part the sky was clear and blue. Suddenly,in the northwest,something caught my eye.It appeared to be a shiny ball,heading to the southeast at high speed. Not a disc on edge, but a ball! At arms length, I estimated it to be the size of a BB. If it were manned and surely it was,it probably was at least 8 ft.in diameter. It &quot;flew&quot; across 50 degrees of sky in 5 to 7 seconds.

All the coyotes in the woods were also howling and barking.  Our house faces front/east back/west. As I turned the corner on the northern part of the house to go from the back to the front, I noticed a red/orange light that appeared to be dancing in the sky.  It was positioned to the NNE of our house.  It is impossible for me to determine how far away it was.  It had the appearance of Alpha Orionis (sp?).  I stood and watched this object continue to dance in a pattern that was neither consistent nor predictable.  The air temperature at the time was @ 53 degrees.  It was partly cloudy, and the moon was at zenith and was 3/4 full. At any rate, the object continued to dance just above the tree line until it simply disappeared.

I went outside and looked up to see an object rather high up, and floating along at a liesurely pace. The object would waiver back and forth showing that it was a flat disc. I watched it for about 10 minutes before it floated quite high and became very hard to see. I wouldnt be reporting this except for the fact that this object seemed to be rather large, and it was a disc shape... i&apos;ve never heard of a weather balloon in this shape before. There were no lights at all on the object, no sound, and it had a shiny metallic skin. I *think* there was a design on the flat face of the object, but I couldn&apos;t make it out.

At around 1:00, a group of lights came from the southwest and passed directly over us going into the northeast.  There were about eight lights arranged into a sort of triangular shape, although it may have been more of an X.  It was hard to tell exactly because the lights were spinning around.  Whatever it was was moving pretty fast because it only took about 6 seconds to cross the sky.  In this time, it made at least 3 rotations tumbling across the sky in a straight line.  I guess it&apos;s possible that it was more than one object and that all the lights were separate, but they were moving as if they were part of the same object. From our point of view, it was hard to tell how high it was, and so also we couldn&apos;t tell how big it was, but it was about 10 degrees across (the length of your fist at arms length)  After seeing this thing, we were both pretty jumpy and left.  After telling a friend what we had seen, they told us that another friend of ours saw something odd also.  Talking with them, it seems we saw the same thing.  they saw it from the side, from the 11th floor of their building, they had a better judgement of its height, and said it was really low in the sky.  If it was low, it was probably about 75-100 feet in length.

The time was 6:45 PM.  As I got nearer, I could see brightly colored lights on the bottom of it and two bright headlights at the front of it.  It was only 100 to 200 feet off the highway to my left side and about 100 or so feet in the air.  It seemed to be surrounded by a light layer of fog.  I was so intrigued by it that I decided to backtrack to try to find its location.  I got off the highway at exit 9 and proceeded to Tolend Road.  After I got on Tolend Road and crossed the bridge that goes over Route 16, I saw it again.  The time now was 6:55 PM, or so.  It flew over the road right in front of me, travelling perpendicular to the direction of the road from my right to my left.  This time, there didn&apos;t seem to be any fog surronding it.

It couldn&apos;t have been going very fast.  I would say no more than 25 to 50 miles per hour which seems to be way to slow for an airplane to travel.  It was approximately 100 feet in the air at this point.  Another interesting thing that I only realized after my friend started to ask me about it was that this object was very quiet.

Suddenly a disk-shaped craft, not very big, zipped down over Crown Mountain in a curvilinear movement and hovered over southern Vancouver, directly in the center of my vision. There was no sound or fumes, and, although the craft was clearly technologically skilled in design and fabrication, it was equally clear that there was a sentient being controlling it, as it moved with choice and a certain sense of style, and not in a robot-like way.

The area is farmed out but is also generally wooded near the Blanco Bend River. Between 10:00 and 10:30pm on the aforementioned date, ((name #2 deleted)) was walking home from a nearby fast food restaurant. He was aware of the time because he had just gotten a new watch recently and was looking at it frequently. It was a quiet, dark and very cool evening with clear skies and bright stars. The new moon occurred on this night so the sky was moonless.((name #2 deleted)) happened to look skyward in order to observe some of the constellations, &quot;And there it was!&quot;, he said. His first thought was, What the hell is THAT?&quot; He was not afraid, he said, but was amazed. He had considered himself to be sceptical about UFO&apos;s, so the experience was impressive and highly elating.  The object was triangular in shape, but it was as if the points of the triangle had been cut off. The cut was perpendicular to the bisection of the anglefor the leading apex, and the other two points were either cut the same as the leading apex or cut perpendicular to the trailing edge of the UFO.((name #2 deleted)) raised his armto an angle of about 60&deg; as an indication of the initial zenith angle relative to him. He could see only the underside surface of the object and it was glowing faintly orange over it&apos;s entirety, like very hot metal.There were no lights and no visible protuberances, but ((name #2 deleted)) did appear to notice what appeared to be geometric shapes on the surface, formed with straight lines. He believes that these were part of the objects structure, rather than decals (painted). He said that the object was &quot;remarkably similar&quot; to those depicted in the &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; segment on Belgium UFO&apos;s.((name #2)) aproximated the arms-length size of the object to be 4&quot;-4.5&quot; (or 10-12 times the size of a full moon). He guessed that the object must have been over 1000 feet away, but then indicated that he was not too good with scales or distances.The vehicle was moving very slowly and in a straight line from south to north (from his right to his left) perpendicular to his walking direction. There was no sound of any kind from the vehicle or otherwise-including no dogs barking. (Any dogs barking would probably have been due to the presence of the object.) He was so taken by the once sighting that he never once gave thought to the possibility that other such objects may have been in the area. ((name #2)) said that he must have watched the object for ten minutes before it passed out of site behind the trees. It never changed speed, direction or altitude during that time. After the object disappeared from view, ((name #2)) continued to stand and look for several minutes, totally awestruck by the experience.Immediately upon returning home, ((name #2)) called the Hays County Sheriff&apos;s Department and reported the sighting. The Dispatcher told him that THERE HAD BEEN OTHER CALLS REGARDING A UFO SIGHTING THAT VERY EVENING! Later, early Monday morning, ((name #2)) called a local Austin FM Radio Station and told a DJ friend of his sighting. After watching the NBC Network&apos;s UNSOLVED MYSTERIES program on the Belium UFO&apos;s during the late fall of 1991, ((name #2)) called their 800 number and reported his sighting. In March Of 1992, ((name #2)) called an Austin ************** group who referred him to someone named ((name #3)) (doesn&apos;t remember last name). ((name #3)) pointed ((namd #2)) to some woman (name not remembered) who referred him to Austin MUFON. On March 23, 1992, ((name #2)) called Austin MUFON and told Mrs. ***** ****** of his sighting. ((name #4)) provided an outline of the sighting to me on March 28, 1992 at a regular MUFON meeting. Scott also called the Hays County Sheriff&apos;s Department to get more information on the UFO sighting. He was told that they had no record of his report or any other report of the UFO.On May, 25, 1992 at 2:00pm CST, I met with name #2)) at his residence and received his report.", "Two odd fireballs moving slowly, silently in daytimeWe saw two fireballs moving slowly and silently across the afternoon, clear blue sky.They were yellow, appeared to be made of moving flame, appeared to be about 1/10 the size of the moon or less.  They were about 60 degrees elevated.Both seemed to have tails behind them (opposite the direction of their movement) which were very small and appeared to have a candle or flame at the end, pointed upwards.They were seen by my family (5 persons) and neighbors (2+ persons).((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Triangle shaped, low-flying, slow, silent Stealth fighter sized object with a red, revolving light on bottom.I am a high school graduate(1976) and one of my favorite classes in high school was Astro-science. My high school had a planetarium built into it and it was always an interesting experience to look forward to everyday. I had an interest in space and always watched televised NASA events. In december of 1995, I finally broke down and bought a 4.5 reflector telescope from a department store. I suddenly became an avid sky-watcher. I bought software to show me where the planets were and started a sketckbook to draw the planets as I was seeing them through my telescope at certain times. I would write the times and dates below the sketches. I was lucky enough to see comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp and a couple of lunar eclipses which I added to my sketchbook. I could point out Jupiter and Saturn and sometimes Mars with my naked eye as well as star clusters such as the Pleiades and nebulas like the one in Orion to friends and co-workers.As I became more aware of just how immense our universe is, my interest in U.F.O.s came to the forefront. I read many books of sightings and have amassed a library of video tapes and books on the phenomena. I was wishing to see one for myself. On Sept.13,1996 I got my chance.At that time in my life, I was delivering pizza for a living and my sighting happened while on a run. I added it to my sketchbook 2 days after I saw it. It is from these notes and my recollection that I now relay the information to you.It happened in the southern-most part of Austin near the intersection of Slaughter and Manchaca. I was driving east on Slaughter lane and crossed Manchaca road and made a right turn onto Bilbrook. Now facing south, I looked in the sky for Jupiter, but the sky just was not quite dark enough to see it yet. I made another quick right turn onto Slaughter Creek drive, a long dead-end road which is where the delivery was going to. Now I was facing west and I saw a bright headlight up in the air and not all that high. I assumed it was a Cessna airplane which I had seen flying in the area before as there is a farmer on Slaughter lane that has his own dirt airstrip and I had seen him flying many times. The light was coming toward me, flying east as I was headed west. As the space between us narrowed, I became aware that it was not the Cessna that I thought it was and I could not identify what kind of plane it was. It was then that I saw that it was a triangle. Curious, I pulled to the side of the road and looked up through my windshield at the thing. &quot;What is that?&quot; I said out loud. It was flying slowly and low. I could not take my eyes off it. &quot;How can that be flying?&quot; I said outloud again. With my car still running, I stepped out of my car and just watched this thing glide overhead. It was after sunset but the sky was not quite dark yet. I became aware that this was my U.F.O. I did not know what it was, how it could be flying,it was to me an unidentified flying object.It was a dark (possibly black) triangle, the trailing edge being a little shorter than the other two with the bright headlight being at the front point. There was a revolving red light on the bottom encased in a glass dome and I remember thinking of a fire engine light. There were two or three other smaller white lights on the bottom shining straight down but they were not that bright. It was heading to the east,parallel with Slaughter Ln. at about 45-50 m.p.h.and there was no noise coming from it that I could hear. It was approximatly 100 yds. to my south and approximatly 300 yds. up. As it flew past, and as I was now looking at the rear of it, I could see a pair of small stabilizer wings on the top of the rear section just like a F-117 Stealth Fighter has. I looked at my watch, and even though I did not make a note of the exact time, I now know it was very near 8:30 p.m. I stood there and watched it slowly glide away over the nearby roofs of a neighborhood until I could no longer see it. I got back in my car and made the delivery and contemplated what I had seen. I was familiar with most planes but I never heard of one that flied so slowly without sound. I thought it might be a Stealth Fighter because it was about the same size, but the shape was not right. An F-117 is triangular, but not a triangle. From my vantage point, it appeared to be a flat triangle gliding through the air. There were no navigation lights (red on the left, green on the right) although, I could not see the entire right side. I wanted to tell my friends when I got back to the store but I did not. I always thought if I ever saw a flying saucer, I would tell everyone that they are real. Now I understood why people hesitate or just keep it to themselves.I hope I have given you enough information to help out in some way. I never reported it and was kind of scared to tell anyone for a while. When I finally showed my sketch of the object and the notes I wrote to one of my friends, he kind of looked at me strange. I know he did not think I was lying, and it seems to me that he thinks I was mistaken about what I saw. But it was completly unknown to me.The only reason that I do not think it was &quot;alien&quot; , is because of the revolving red light on the bottom and the stabilizer wings on the rear. But still, I was pretty exited and I am glad that now I can tell you about it. Thank you.", "Craft follows our car up the highway for at least 10 minutes then takes off when we change direction and speed abruptly.Hey, my name is ((deleted)), I live in North Providence, RI USA.  I was travelling home with three of my friends who all like in the same town.  Were coming from another friend&apos;s house in Coventry, RI.  We were travelling in two cars, I was in the passenger seat of my friend Joe&apos;s &apos;85 Firebird.  My friends John and Domenic were right behind us in Domenic&apos;s &apos;72 Nova (so no slouch cars, they come up later).  We merged onto Route 95 North from exit 6 in Rhode Island.  We travelled about a mile and a half when I saw to the East Southeast something flying North and the exact same speed as we were travelling.  The craft was just above the tree line, it had sort of a bulky saucer shape and it had six yellow lights that were extremely dim and barely visible.  It looked very large, but I couldn&apos;t tell how far it was from us yet.  We called our friends travelling next to us in the lane to our left.  We coordinated between the two cars (using cellphones) to slow down and speed up together, and the craft sped up and slowed down with us with virtually no delay, it was moving with us.  I knew there was no was this was a plane, there was no sound, it was flying too low, even though we were only several miles from the state airport in Warwick.  So we continued travelling North, and we coordinated a maneuver to see how the craft would react.  When the highway split to 295 North and 95 North, Domenic and John in the Nova swerved behind us and sped up 95 while Joe and I in the Firebird sped up Route 295, as soon as Domenic and John were just out of our sight in the other car, the craft took a 90 Degree turn towards the East and shot so fast out of sight that if you blinked you would have missed it.  This thing took off faster than the supersonic jets at the air show, I&apos;ve never seen any plane do anything like this before, it was amazing.  It was at that last moment that I finally got an idea how far away it was because the tree line had started to clear and a hotel that I know was about 1/2-3/4 miles away was i! n the foreground just before the craft shot out of sight.  So most likely it was no more than a mile away.  It seemed to be moving up a little bit as it took off, but it happened so quickly I really could not tell.  The most amazing part of the whole encounter was that the craft made no noise and it changed speeds as we did with no delays or jerky movements, it was all very fluid in terms of movement.  I really wish I had a camera because I got some great looks at this thing, it was a clear night, relatively quiet and the moon was fairly bright.  I might be off on the date, I don&apos;t remember the exact date.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "I remember this date and time distinctively , as it wax tax day , my first year in buisness .A friend and myself decided to go catfishing at the &quot;salt creeek&quot; in Ashland NE.I was a very beautiful night with clear skies . We hung out late in hopes of catchin a big one . Around 3:30am we decided to take off , fishing was slow that night .We were heading back toward omaha on highway 6 .Just after we had crossed the bridge by the creek , my buddy riding shotgun notices something very strange and tells me to look up .  To my surprise , I notice 4 flare like objects slowly descending . One was well above the others , all of wich were no further than 1000 yards away . Its seems to me the bigger one may have been triangle shaped .  The other 3 that at first glance looked like flares descending slowly as if they were attatched to parachutes . Then all of  the sudden , the 3 smaller object starting movinging around in different directions . 2 of them seemed to travel off to the west , and one seem to come straight down .  Behind the trees ,the entire area in the field was lit up like a football stadium at night .At this point , I could hardly keep the car on the road . We turned back and decided to further investigate . I found a country road , that was closest in the direction of  the crafs . we were driving up this dirt road , west toward farm area . Between us and the creek , around 3-500 yards away , we could see this glowing plasma ball like object , kinda bluish white , and green at times , howevering in the tops of a tree .Almost blinding to look at .I remeber there was also another witnes that was driving a 84 chevy s-10 pickup coming towards us . we were both coming at each other  maybe 5 miles per hour . And it was obvious , this guy was withouth a doubt looking at the same thing .After this guy passed us , i figured what the hell , ya only live once , we pulled off road into the feild and got out of the car . Mind blown on what we were seeing we started walkin toward it .I do not remember any noise. Within a couple minutes of getting closer , it started getting super foggy . Visibility began to get poor . The illumination of the of object grew dimmer and dimmer . all the sudden it was gone , vanised . We waited for the fog to clear and could not find even a trace of evidence , i wished to god I would have had a camera.we still discuss it from time to time , and the last couple of years I&apos;ve been keeping my eyes on these reports to see if anything else was reported around that date , or in that same exact area . I guess im posting in hopes of finding more info on what we saw .The funny thing is , after talking about it all these years , we realized that when it was over , we were driving home at sunrise . Not sure if we lost time or not , it is possible .We are going to conduct further investigation this year with camera (digital , and completely mechanical ) . I will post updates if we find anything . I will also try to get my bud to post as well , in case there is something he saw that i didnt . One thing is for damn sure , they were without a doubt aircraft of some sort , but definitely not of this world .", "Super fast white light flying horizontal for 20 sec.  flash in mid-air then goneDriving home from band practice, Lochbuie, Co. 5/5/04.Heading, looking South.

It was about 10:30 at night, and I was walking into my family room which is in the front of the house with a big bay window facing South.  it was dark in there, and I went in to sit on the couch and pet the cat while I waited for my husband to come home from work.  Wheile I was walking into the room I noticed a very bright white light in the sky.  I&apos;m not sure how high in the sky it was, but from looking out of my window it was above the tree lines straight ahead. I noticed it right away since it was so bright.  It didn&apos;t move, so I thought at first it was a planet, but was not familiar with their locations in the sky, so I didn&apos;t know which ones were visible this time of year.  Anyway, I petted the cat for a bit while I watched it.  It was beautiful, and so bright that it &quot;shined&quot; like a diamond would.  I began looking around the rest of the sky, and I noticed an amber colored light far from the other light moving rather quickly heading in the direction of my house  I noticed no blinking lights on it.  Now here is where I get concerned.. About a month ago a friend and I were out driving and noticed an amber light in the sky moving quickly and not blinking.  We pulled over and watched it.  It then suddenly vanished..just turned off like a flashlight would.  It had us &quot;freaked out&quot;.  I had never seen anything unusual in the sky before, so after that I have noticed myself looking in the sky more lately. Well, I then went to the back of my house to my back porch to see it pass over the house, and after it did, once again it vanished over the apartment complex behind my house.  Please bare in mind I cannot specify exact height or distances when something is in the sky moving.  I listened, and since I am close to a heavily traveled highway, I cannot tell if the sound I heard was a jet, or vehicles on the highway.  If it was a jet, it had to be military since it was moving much faster than a regular plane. However, I thought even military planes had to have some type of blinking light, or at least some type of light at all times, not just invisible in the night sky. Well, I went on with other things, and my husband came home around 11:00 p.m. and I still saw that bright light in the sky from my window.  About 10 minutes later we went upstairs to bed, and after I got ready I went into my son&apos;s room which too is upstairs and faces south (it is actually right above my family room) the light was gone!  I looked around, and I could see stars all over around where the light had been, so a cloud wasn&apos;t covering it.  I kept checking back for over an hour, and still no more light.  It too just vanished. It had remained in the same spot the entire time I had seen it, so it was&apos;t a low flying plane, and it was extremely bright!  Since I knew nothing about planets, and thought that&apos;s what it was at first, I know now that planets are really not that bright either.  Still, I can&apos;t find an explanation for it disappearing like that. I am hoping someone can set my mind at ease.  Two months and the same occurance, plus another disappearing act with a light on the same night. Are they connected to each other? Am I going crazy, or is there something else in the sky?((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at Venus.  PD))", "BRIGHT light falling, hour later light leaving southMe and my friend were standing out in front of the house smoking a cigarette, I was telling him about a UFO I thought I had saw earlier in the night when all of a sudden a bright white sphere with a tail streaks about (perspective-from-ground) 5ft. through the air and dissapears instantly. The object was so close that it had lit up the whole street. &quot;If it had been a falling star that close there would have been smoke lingering in the air&quot;, I said to my friend. Eight minutes after we had seen it there was a loud, deep EXPLOSION, it didn&apos;t sound like a backfire or gunshot. We were pretty freaked out. We sat their for about an hour discussing what we had seen, trying to identify what we had seen logically, when a light that had been sitting in the sky for that whole hour, decided to just start heading south and dissapear maybe 4 seconds after it had started moving. The odd thing about it was that when it had started moving the sky was just starting to turn blue from the sun coming up. That is what my friend and I saw. Believe me, it was scary.

Even now I&apos;m not so sure what to believe!  I looked up to early morning sky (pre sunrise) to see a commercial airline jet traveling from southeast to northwest at approximately 6:05 AM. Along the contrail I saw a pinhead speck of bright light moving irratically up and down the port side of the contrail.  It darted towards it, then back away from it several times.  The light then traveled up and down the one side of the contrail.  It followed the contrail back up to the rear of the jet then back down the contrail, again.  It then began to dart in and out of the contrail and finally passed through it to the the starboard side.  It repeated its motions up and down and in and out of the contrail, than passed back through it to the port side.  Once again it moved very quickly up to the rear of the jet and then disappear.  I cannot tell you the elevation at which the jet was flying.  I&apos;m sure that this can be found out from one of the airports (Vancouver International) air traffic control. Note: We regularly have commercial jets fly over the Queen Charlotte Islands.  Port Clements is at about the center of Graham Island, part of the QUeen Chalotte/Haida Gwaii chain of islands that is about 500 miles north of Vancouver, British Columbia and about eighty miles out into the Pacific Ocean from the British Columbia mainland. I have never seen anything like this in my life!  I know that I saw a pinhead size very bright light moving irractically at a very high altitude.  I don&apos;t know of anything that would perform in such a fashion at that altitude, either. I hope that I&apos;m not bothering you with this report.  I just don&apos;t know what to think!  It was not a jet/escort jet, I&apos;m sure, at least not flying in the manner that this object flew.

One night I decided to pull over for a break when i spotted one of these unusal lights, thats when i noticed the movement of them. To give an idea of where they are in the sky i&apos;d say between 45 and 60 degrees up, and the lights will sway left right a few times and up and go real low. My first thought after watching this the first night was a helicopter and i pushed it to the back of my mind. The next night i saw again this light, again noticing it because of the off color it was and when i stopped to watched it did the normal up down and side to side then in shot off stright up and was gone into the night sky. Of course after this it had my full attention and I brought it to the attention of my running partner after this.

I was about 2 mlles north of the rest area located at mile post 13 on I-5.  Above the trees I could see a shiny, round object.  I thought it was a plane with light reflecting off the fuselage, making the shape hard to ascertain.  (I was more aware of this because when I was passing the Woodland airfield, a small plane had just taken off, but the bright sunshine reflecting off the plane was making it hard to see). As i got closer to the object, the appearance became more spherelike.  It reminded me of a shiny beach ball (note: at about 2 mles out, it looked to be the size of a large beach ball) with a band around the middle.  When I was about a half mile from the object, it made a rolling turn and disappeared.  I thought perhaps it had somehow become blocked from view by the trees, but when I drove past the trees, there was nothing to be seen.  The sky was empty as far as my eyes could see and the object was just plain gone. I do not know how many other people saw the object, but if anyone did, they did not pull off the road nor did they give any indication that they had seen the object.", "5 orange lights illuminate sky NNW of Ft Branch, IN then fade away.While driving north on HWY 41 just south of Ft. Branch, IN, I noticed a bright orange light against a clear, dark sky just NNW of the town and high enough that it could not have been any street lights. The light came on then after about 15 seconds, it slowly faded away. Approx. a minute or so later I saw the light again come on in roughly the same area. A few seconds later another to the west of the original came on, then one just to the east of the original, then another just to the west near the original and the last appeared between the 2nd and 4th. Here is how the series of lights appeared: (2...5...4...1...3). The shape of the lights when all were lit was slightly curve-shaped. After about 15-20 seconds the lights began to fade away. I pulled off the highway onto a road just on the south edge of town where I would be able to gain a better vantage point in a field. After stopping and getting out of my vehicle I ran to the field and looked again. It took a minute or so for me to notice any lights again, but one came back on then faded away as before. No other observances were noted this evening on the rest of my way home. There was another vehicle on the highway just behind me that should have seen it as well as we were driving north and they did appear to slow down once the 5 lights came on, but I can not say that this is why they did slow down. There was no other immediate reason for them to given our location on the road and no traffic signals to stop at. There were also other commercial aircraft in the sky during this time, but in no close proximity to the lights observed.", "I was 13 years old spending my summer vacation from school at my Parents cottage in a remote area south of Collingwood, Ontario Canada.  This is at the highest old mountain range in Ontario called the Blue Mountains.  At that time, I had no other friends to play with and I used to wander off into the woods with my 22 Rifle playing Daniel Boon.  The exact date, I cannot remember anymore, but it was one of those hot still bright summer nights that I was out and I was sitting down just looking at the stars.  I was looking North, North West.  At this time, in a cloud less perfect star viewing night, with millions of stars above me, I noticed a bright blue Object that I believe was a satellite, traveling in a South East direction directly overhead of me.  Satellites were known at this time and I often had seen them before.  This time however, the Satellite was being followed directly behind at a distance of, looking up, one quarter of an inch.  The following object was also blue in colour but about one quarter in size and was dimmer.  I watched these two objects until they passed out site still heading south east.  In my opinion, these objects were in near space, and were not aircraft.  I am now 52 years old, an outdoorsman, and a stargazer.  I have seen many satellites since, but never one being followed.", "giant craft move slowly over lake It suddenly flashed brightly and went out.

This sighting occurred this morning as I was driving home from work. It was a beautiful, clear morning with the usual crisscrossing contrails in the sky. As I entered the interstate, I-75 northbound, I noticed an unusual contrail rising vertically from the horizon. I pulled over, looked up through my windshield, and saw that the contrail continued straight up for about a third of the visible sky and then made a 20 to 25 degree course change to the left. I followed the path of the contrail until I could see that a small, triangular shape continuing to travel almost vertically into the morning sky was making the contrail. It looked like a rocket on a path into the stratosphere. I watched the object moving upward until its altitude was such that I could no longer see it. The contrail dissipated until only the initial vertical contrail was still faintly visible; it remained so for about another ten minutes. As I continued my drive homeward, I could see the vertical contrail straight ahead of me in the northern sky. There are no large military bases in this area from whence a rocket might be launched. The only base is an Air National Guard base located to the south of the city. Is it possible that I witnessed a rocket launch that originated at a distant location?  This was definitely NOT an airliner or a typical military jet. I see those almost every day and I am quite familiar with their characteristic contrails. This was quite different. I would appreciate an opinion as to what I might have witnessed this morning. Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Contrail?

All lights in my house were turned off.  I saw what appeared to be a meteor shower in the northwest sky.  Something about the way the lights were travelling made me quickly realize it was not infact meteors.  I went out my front door and looked to the sky where the light were and watched as they moved positions, almost like how birds flying south do.  There appeared to be 7 of the objects moving at about the same speed but changing places.  The creepiest part of the whole experience was that they didn&apos;t seem too far off and they where completely silent.  I am involved with jet car racing and know that to attain a speed like what I witnessed would have to involve some sort of afterburning jet engine that would create and incredible amount of noise at that altitude and speed.  I an located just to the east of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in Sherwood Park and from where I was they appeared to fly from The Fort Saskatchewan area towards the Camrose area.

The area is rural, dotted with farms along the highway. Witness states that he was doing about 70 mph when he saw what appeared to him as a semi-circle of lime green blurred lights, decending rapidly in a pasture field along the interstate. The lights appeared &quot;ambient&quot; to him or that they were emissions from recesses ( he called them &quot;stove pipes&quot;)and that he was not actually seeing the source of the lights.The lights decended rapidly and stopped some 50 feet from the ground. The lights then became very clear, and clearly arranged in a semi-circular pattern, possibly indicating a round or disc shaped object. The witness could not see any outline of any such craft but the lights seemed to him to be some 50 feet across. At his speed, he saw the lights for only a matter of seconds and was afraid to slow down or stop.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Kim Shaffer, MUFON Assistant State Director for Tennessee, for following up on the original report and sharing his findings with NUFORC.

We also noticed the large amount of military and/or commercial air traffic in the area at the time. We are relatively close to several military installations, and not far off from at least three international airports, so large amounts of air traffic are not unusual. Suddenly, upon gazing up into the sky at one point, I noticed two conventional aircraft that appeared to be flying in the same direction relatively close together, almost as if flying in formation. I advised my friend of this, who noted it as well. What we both also noted, however, that just off the right - tail of the aircraft on the right, matching its speed, was a solid white light - almost an orb. It was bright and appeared almost as if a star was moving accross the sky. It appeared to be following the jet on the right. The jet on the left began moving in a more norternly direction while the jet on the right continued moving more on a due east track. The white light appeared to follow the jet on the right for an additional brief period of time. Eventually, the white light appeared to track on an even more easternly direction, thus no longer following the plane. We watched this white as it continued all the way out into the distance where it was no longer visible. That strange thing is that this light had no strobes or flashing lights or anything you would expect to be on a normal aircraft. It was simply a steady white light. Very odd. And the fact that it was so close to a larger jet aircraft was even more odd. I wish I had thermal imaging gear or even a pair of standard binoculars so that I could have made out the aircrafts structure. For all I know, it was a plane. It did not take any actions or manuvers that were out of this world. It did not change color or shape. It just simply moved at roughly the same speed as two aircraft which were lighted in such a way that one could identify ! them as aircraft.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

There were other vehicles going the same direction as I, but none of them stopped or looked at it. It seemed that I was the only one seeing it! It was about 50 feet from me to the east.

This time it was lower in the night sky and I got scared.  Again it appeared as single sparks of fireworks but it was certainly a craft of some sort and the &quot;sparks&quot; were light.

It passed south west to south east in a perfectly staight line. It was unusual because it seamed to appear out of thin air. I remember that got my attention. I decided to study it and not take my eyes off. As it passed over I noticed the sun was reflecting off the surface of the object, without that sun being at that angle at that time of day it would have reflected its surroundings and dissapeared as it did a few minues later when my viewing angle changed from the proximity of the sun and the craft. I could almost be certian that there would be very few different angles that you would see the object. The reflective qualities alloud me to observe what was imediately on the other side of the craft. I determined that this quality of stealth reflection could only be achieved if the craft was a perfect sphere. The extra light from the sun gave shape to the object. The farther it moved from my position the more faded the suns reflection became, until it was gone, but I still new it had to be there. That was really frustrating. I new it was close enough that I should still be able to see it. It wasn&apos;t like a plane that you see how far you can watch it for. It wasn&apos;t even close to being that far away.

I didn&apos;t think anything of it but Lisa brought up the fact that not many people if any were wearing colored contacts in those days, and there was no possible way those green eyes were his real color.He also had dark skin and the most chisled features we&apos;d ever seen on a person. I also asked Lisa what he was driving that night. She said a motorcyle and that&apos;s what I thought too.

Distance I first saw it was five to seven mile away crossed in front of me two the three miles ahead and again stopped I would say ten miles north then zoom off The area is all rural trees and pasture land. I know military aircraft and this was not one of them I would stay the altitude was 1000 to 1500 feet A few moments later I crossed the Trinty river which empties into lake Dallas and wonder if this was where it had crossed. Now north is another lake, Lake Roberts. Wish I could be more helpful, but it happen so fast!", "bright light, white, with hints of gold.This was a very bright light above, well above, the tree tops, possibly 1-5 miles distant.  I&apos;d say it was about half the size of a dime held at arm&apos;s length.  Far too  bright to be a star, it caught my attention immediately as I was taking the dog out in the yard.  My exact reaction was &quot;What the hell?&quot;  I moved around the yard, watching it in relation to trees, poles, etc., and could see that it was bobbing and weaving gently (rocking motion).  I planted my feet firmly and studied it in relation to stars, and it was the only thing moving.  I finally went into the house and told my wife, &quot;I know you&apos;re not going to believe this, but there&apos;s a UFO out the back.&quot;  She said, &quot;Sure, Sure.&quot;  I asked her to come look, and she said, &quot;I cannot even believe I&apos;m getting up for this.&quot;  But as we got out back, she watched it for a bit and admitted she couldn&apos;t really say what it was.  I went in and got a small digital camera and snapped a few pictures of it.  The best shows a round object with &apos;spiral arms&apos; of light coming off it.  I also took a brief &apos;movie&apos; but have not had a chance to put it on the computer.  On the camera, it appears blank.  About 15 mins later, my wife and I left to pick up our daughter from a dance.  I said, &quot;Well, if it IS a star or planet, it will be there when we get back.  If it&apos;s gone, we&apos;ll know it was something else.&quot;  We returned by 11:15 and it was no where in the sky.  I climbed the high back porch on our house and scanned the entire horizon and there was nothing.  If this had been a star or planet, it could not have &apos;gone down&apos; in such a brief span of time.  I&apos;m a meteorologist, and habitually study the sky.  I feel I&apos;m a pretty good observer.  I couldn&apos;t call this a &apos;flying saucer&apos; but it was certainly something airborne that was not identifiable as anything conventional. I will submit the pictures via email as soon as I can get them transferred to the computer.", "More light balls, orbs or something over NJI was heading North on the Garden State Parkway and was passing over the Driscoll Bridge when I first spotted this object. I am giving you this information so those of you who live or know New Jersey know exactly where I viewed this event from. I was eyeballing the sky, off towards my left, in the direction of South Plainfield, and this object may have been further off than that in fact. Now, I am 32 years old, have been a skywatcher (day and night skies) for all of my life and have been driving an automobile for over 14 years as well. I have 20/20 vision and can identify and spot the difference between a small plane, a jet liner, a helicopter and a satelite. In fact, I have performed formal research in the field in UFOlogy as well. What I first thought was a jet plane, taking a North by North East flight path and which I was waiting for to hook towards the vicinity of Newark International Airport never did. I first thought this was a plane and although it was slowly becoming a clear blue sky at 11:45AM, with some very high level clouds, scattered and disapating as the day wore on. I also gussed that this plane still had its headlights on and what I was seeing was one of two things, lens flare or reflection of the sun off the planes exterior. Neither was to be the case. This object was more of a sphere type ball of light and was more orange in color than it was yellow or light. This is what caught my attention most. Second, instead of the object banking left (it&apos;s left, my right as I assumed it was heading in my direction), it proceed to accelerate upwards into some high level clouds and then out of site rather quickly  I am submitting this hopes that others in the area who may have also seen this thing can have some validation that others saw it as well. Thank you in advance, John", "A quick round like craft in the sky and vanishing when i knoticed it while walking at night.As walking down the street i look up to see a round like craft with a blueish/green auora and it happened to vanish as i looked in the sky and knoticed it&apos;s presense. This isn&apos;t the first time this has happened in san clemente, there has also been various reports and other witnesses who have seen the same objects at night or so with the quickly vanishing objects in the skys. I wish there could be a real explination for it.", "They  could have been traveling by power from magnetic fields, they  appeared to slip through the sky.These disk were sighted as I turned off Highway 25 South on to the Craig Spring Road, South of Starkville, Mississippi.  The Moon was very bright and just before making my right turn I glanced up and there they were.  They looked to be approximately 20 feet in diameter, shaped like a disk, they looked silver in color,I didn&apos;t see any lights on these things, they were traveling West. They seemed to be about100 yards apart, one was leading the way and the other one was following.  As I traveled West on the Craig Spring Road, they were traveling West on the South side of the Craig Springs Road.  After watching them for approximately 4 minutes they had gotten far away and looked the size of a half dollar. With the bright Moon and the silver color of these things they had a kind of glow and could be seen easily.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Multiple orange lights over a nuclear reactor.I was returning from a freinds home, he had dropped me off at my mail box. As I turned around from getting my mail I saw two large orange balls of light directly above my house about 30 degrees up. They appeared to be directly over the Arkansas Nuclear 1 reactor about 2 miles from my location. As I watched the two lights split into three then four and then dissapeared completely.  I do not know how long the total duration was as i only caught the apparent end of the display.", "Commuting home from work during an ice storm I encountered a UFO.I have this information in my word processing program.  I would prefer to send you hard copy of the events.  I saw them on two different occasions exactly 1 week apart at approximately 5:30 p.m.  The first one was 15 miles away from the second one.  The first one was approximately the size of a medcine ball, the second was different.  It was shaped like a set of bar bells, 15&quot; spheres separated by a 12&quot; bar of glowing light.  The light was a gloden glow like the filament of light bulbs. Had my car windows been open I could have reached out and touched either of them, therefore, they had to be within 2&quot; of my face. Both objects glowed like the filament of a light bulb.  Both were silent.  The first or perhaps both of them were highly energized.  The first one occurred during an ice storm.  My boss sent me home from work early due to the weather.  I was a bit out of Coates, Minnesota southbound on Hwys 52 &amp; 56 when I noticed this large ball of light drifting across the field towards me. Due to the foul weather I was only driving 15 or 20 miles per hour, the UFO I would guess was going about the same speed.  The road was very icy and I couldn&apos;t stop.  It was so icy the car was sheathed in a coat of ice 1/4&quot; or more thick.  The ice hadn&apos;t even melted directly over the center of the engine after having traveled about 15 miles from my work place. The ball came across the field, into the ditch and up onto the road.  I thought it was some form of ball lightening though I had never seen that phenomena previously.  It came across the shoulder and onto the pavement.  I couldn&apos;t stop because of icy road conditions.  Also, I thought I&apos;m in a car with four good rubber tires under me and as soon as this &quot;lightening&quot; touched the car it would dissipate. The ball came up the corner of the car and across the hood at a diagonal.  It just missed the corner post on the driver&apos;s side of the car.  It then went down the side of the car and continued across the highway and the field on that side.  It continued on it&apos;s path from the southeast to the northeast.  During it&apos;s transit, the car engine cut out cold.  I don&apos;t recall if I had to restart it as the car did keep moving, I may have turned the key again to start it. Where it had come across the hood the metal was instantly dry.  The right side of the hood was still encased in ice.  The edge of the &apos;cut&apos; was smooth as if cut by a knife.The rest of the ice remained on the car for several hours after I arrived home, my husband commented on the dry section and remaining ice when he saw the car. Precisely one week later, same time of day, 15 miles south of the first encounter and on my own street, 1/2 mile east of my home, another UFO appeared.  This was the one shaped like two basketballs with a bar between them.  This one circled the car twice as if pearing in on me and checking my out.  Why, I don&apos;t know, but nine months later I gave birth to my only child. The car was a 52 Chevy in almost new condition.  The contact melted the component where all the wires and distribution system for the electrical system was.  The annoyance from all electrical components malfunctioning repeatedly after that got to be too frustrating for us and we got another car. Two men in black did come to my door following this incident.  I didn&apos;t want to get involved with them and I told them I thought it was two incidents related to ball lightening.  However, I have lived a lot of years since and have never met with the same phenomena since. Unbeknownest to me, I had serious birth defects in my reproductive system.  When the doctors finally found them and removed my uterus; they were amazed that I had been able to have a child at all. When this boy and I were younger we both could change traffic lights at will, switching the lights from red to green.  Since then there have been changes made in traffic control technology and that is no longer possible.", "Date: 1998 Time: 10:00 p.m. Then in March 1998 we had another sighting. On the moors I noticed a strange ambient light as I looked out of the car window as I drove along. I initially thought someone was having an outdoor party (it was almost 10:00 p.m.), As I drove along the road I could see what it was. It was a flying saucer at ground level about to take off. As I watched it lifted into the sky, rotating like a giant Ferris wheel. 90 seconds later it was high in the sky. My wide saw it too as did some clients of mine who were in the area at 8:00 p.m.. So it had been there for 2 hours. This sighting - within 300 yards is situated the TV transmitter station - the tallest building in the area, manned 24 hours a day; those guys must have seen it, filmed it, reported it, etc., etc. Yet not a word appeared on the local TV News. Yet a few months afterwards the local TV News DID carry a different flying saucer story which they could explain (it was a mobile camera belonging to the BBC flying above a football ground).

I assumed it was most likely a small plane but noticed it was traveling faster than most. As I watched the white light blinked out. A few seconds later there was a single red strobe flash and then the white light reappeared going back the way it came just as fast. There is no way a small plane could have reversed directions that fast. I grabbed my new Video camera and in the few seconds it took to warm up the light blinked out again. There was still a little light in the sky but I could see nothing in the area. I checked with my binoculars but found nothing.. April. 14 - Approx:. 10:00 PM - Observed what appeared to be a fairly large meteorite heading in a northerly direction. As I watched it suddenly shrank in size and within seconds just appeared to be a satellite still heading in the same direction. Very similar to that object I saw back in the summer of 2002. I forgot to write this down but it occurred around the beginning of April 2004. The weather was overcast with low thick clouds. Approx:. 5 PM. I was playing on my computer when I noticed, Two dull yellow disk shaped objects, flying one behind the other in a SSE directions. Cloud level was approx:. 1000 ft. and these glowing disks appeared to be either in the clouds or just over them. I would estimate they were about over the area of 108 and King George and from that distance appeared to be about the size of the full moon. Estimated speed approx:. 3 to 4 hundred miles an hour. Time of sighting about five to ten seconds. My new camera has night vision and can see better than I can in the dark. The other night I saw that strange light which appears to flash white, blue and red. I aimed the camera at it and started zooming in and it must be in near orbit as the image filled my view finder even before it got to full digital zoom. (900X) Normal stars still look like stars slightly magnified. Anyway I did not see the blue and red lights which I&apos;ve seen through my binoculars but did see reddish looking protudences on the sides. Reminded me of Mickey Mouse. The white object appeared to be rotating quite fast but that may just have been an effect caused by the atmosphere. Just for the heck of it I left the camera running while pointed up at the sky, to my surprise I saw what appeared to be very two very faint satellites pass through the rather narrow field of view within about five minutes. I also noticed several dark shadowy objects passing in front of the stars in the view finder. I tried looking at the same area through my binoculars but could only just barely make out the stars. One other thing I just remembered I got my new camera on the 13th. of April and spent all afternoon playing with it. My wife was getting annoyed and told me to put it away. About five minutes later I saw what appeared to be a small plane flying by about two blocks from here. The lights didn&apos;t look right and it was flying not much higher than my apt. I grabbed my binoculars and took a look but was unable to see the fuselage if it had one. Could only see the lights. Two small lights on what I took to be the nose, one red, one white. Where the wings should be I saw a bright blue light and a red one on the other side both larger then the nose lights, behind the wings? I saw two more lights mounted one behind the other one large white one and a large red one. As it passed the Green tower at City Centre Mall I could see a small white light on its tail. It had been heading east but swung to a southerly heading after passing the tower. Anyway it looks like it might be a good summer for sightings, hopefully I will manage to get something on tape. I got a little excited this afternoon while playing back my tape from yesterday evening on my TV. I saw this thing with two big yellow lights and what looked light a dark saucer shape in the background, after watching it for a few seconds I realized it was an aircraft with its landing lights on. I have also noticed a number of times now those single strobe flashes which seem to be coming from space. my camera has picked them up numerous times now. I&apos;ve played them back one frame at a time and they only seem to last for one frame and I can see nothing around them even with the camera set at about 20X zoom.

The firts siting occurance took place at 2:00am around Feb. 22, 2004.  the locatiopn of the house is in the middle of nowhere so it is unlikely that it was people.  The only person who saw this light was my grandmother so this part is second hand.  She claims that she woke up around 2 o&apos;clock in the morning by a blood red light flashing in her room, she stated that the light was only there for about 3 min.  there was no sound. the way the room is situated on the bottom cornor of the house she could see the lights in her bathroom window and side window, she claims that it light the hole room up like a roman candle.  that after noon i went to the area were there might have been tracks and could not find any.the second occurance took place the same day that night.  i was out in the guest house with my brother watching TV.  my brother had already gone to bed and was sleeping across the room. when i went to bed it turned off the lights in the house and left the tv on so i could watch a little more.  a few min later a yellow light flashed out side the kitchenette window and light up the small one room house i did not take into consideration that it might have been a UFO because a drivewa runs right behind the house and i dismissed it as the neighbor, but the only thing that got me to rethink me evaluation was the absence of noise from the hole event.  if you have seen anything like this win south Alabama or west Florida during this time please post your siting report.i dont know how much this has to do with the siting but just a few days later i had a wierd dream that i was standing in a field and i could feel the wind blowing, i was looking up in the sky watching the stars and a pllane flew into view as the plane reached the center of my sight an object behind the plane light up vvery brightly causing me to squint. the object was a circular craft with lights that spun around the craft it manuvered itself over the plane witch light up appearing to be a boeing 747 (i live in Savannah, GA so i know the difference in a UFO and an airplane of any type) then another hugh flash of light and the Plane was gone and the UFO fle woff at a great speed to my left in the dream at a great rate of speed.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "East Lakeland sightingsThe objects were first observed while traveling north east along Interstate 4 west of Lakeland just east of County Line Road. The objects numbered in two at this point and kept in a linear formation. The colors of the objects were yellowish in color at this distance. At one point, the objects appeared to make a 60 degree angle to the eastern horizon. The objects were kept in view for about 10 minutes until one of the two observers picked up there car at a local church where it was parked. The other observer who was driving at the time of the first observation continued to his home. I then decided to drive in the direction of the lights and fueled up my car at the Sunoco at the corner of US 92 and Combee Road. After that I regained sight of the objects and turned onto Reynolds Road in order to keep the objects in view. At this point two more objects appeared to the south of the first two objects. These objects were close in angular separation. Upon reaching the stoplight at CR 540A, I noted several cars parked about 200 feet within the road that leads to Travis Vo-Tech center. Then turned east then turned into the PCC/USF campus in order to have a safe location to view the objects. It was noted that there was a red pickup truck located in the western most parking lot situated in such a way that the occupants may have been observing the objects in question. At this point the objects were about the brightness of Jupiter and had an orange-red color. The best color estimate would be that of the plume of an Atlas booster. I noted the car of a PCC employee that I know and decided to try to get him to witness the object. At this time he was on duty as the night security guard. I walked into the security office and told him what was being observed. He stepped out and observed the same lights in the east that I had. Five other employees also observed the lights. One I know personally and four others I do not know. The lights now were separated by approx 20 degrees of arc horizontal. The other two ! lights that were to the south now were not visible. The light then faded to invisibility. After the pair faded, another light approx. 10 degrees above the set that faded came into view. Once again lights to the south came on and were visible through the branches of nearby trees. The lights were observed through a pair of 7x35 binoculars. The light showed no structure. The lights faded again and the first pair came on again. After several minute, the lights faded and they were not observed from that point forward. At the time the wind was blowing roughly out of the east to southeast at a speed of about 5 to 10 mph. At first we though we maybe observing the burners from hot air balloons, but soon noted that the objects did not move over the period of the observations. Also the objects appeared as point sources, but they did exhibit some twinkling. We also did not observe structure. We made some other guesses as to what we were observing (flares dropped during military activity) but could not come up with an adequate explanation at that time. The Avon Park Bombing Range is about 30 miles to the southeast of Lakeland, the objects could have been military activity? I am an amateur astronomer with 22 years of observing time and have a BS. in Physics, the other observers had varied backgrounds.", "Strange moon shpaed object that continues to move from side to sideI have been watching this object that looks like the moon or a planet for over 45 minutes.  At first I thought it was an aircraft looking large from the fog or cloud cover.It is still there.  It keeps moving from side to side and then becomes still.  It looks just like the moon but is so much smaller.  It moves in strange ways.  Then bcomes completely still. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, we suspect.

However, we do not understand how a sighting as dramatic as the one he describes can take place, and only one group of witnesses observes the phenomenon.  Moreover, we do not understand why the witnesses would not telephone authorities, or friends, in order to have other people witness the alleged event.  We received no other reports.

While traveling through the Snowy Range area, we witnessed an object in the sky that was unlike anything that I have ever seen.   It looked like an inverted teardrop or ice cream cone shape.   The sky was clear with no clouds on the background.   The color of the object was crystalline with definite structure lines that seemed to be silver.   It was close enough to tell that it was not a weather balloon or something like that.   It was clearly rigid with a defined structure and did not waver back and forth like a balloon would.   The object seemed to float steadily and then descended to the ground after several seconds but did not descend all the way to the surface.   Rather, it seemed to lower itself below the tree line so that we could not view it anymore.My friend and I were utterly mystified at to what this object was yet we did not feel threatened at any time.   I am under the impression that this could be some sort of military application but the shape seemed so inconsistent with anything that humans build.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The article goes like this:  &quot;I was contacted by Omar to let me know in a calm and precise wayy that last Tuesday he saw UFOs over Cairo that emmited a very bright white light that doesn&apos;t resemble any electrical light that we know of. --Omar is a good friend of my kids since they were together in school, 4 years back, he graduated from the American University in Cairo, he is now working hard in a media and TV company in Cairo, Egypt--  the objects were similar to Neon lights that were floating  in the sky, or similar to a huge Frankfurter shape with rounded edges. Omar said that this was not the first time to see those flying objects.  He continues that 8 years back he was sleeping on his bed in one summer night and saw a huge light ball outside his balcony with a trail of non-contineous lights. It lasted for few seconds, turned the place into bright daylight then vanished... ..I asked him wither someone else saw what he saw last week and he instantly said that his mom and driver also was there and saw that.  They were all in the car on the &quot;Mouneib Bridge&quot; going from Cairo to Giza and saw those bright objects above the Giza Pyramids, so they stopped the car and went down to watch better, and kept watching till they dissapeared.  At that point I myself discovered that I also saw those same lights later during the same night and in the same pattern Omar has discribed!!... [the writer goes into details about perseption theories and how other countries are studying UFOs phenomena since the 40s]  [the writer switches to his story] &quot;I too saw the same phenomena later during the same night, 01/25/2000, i was coming back on the Alitalia flight from Algeria via Italy to Cairo airport. we were still far above Cairo with its glittering lights.  I suddenly saw this bright light very visible among the relivantly dimmer city lights. Then it dissapeared. It was similar to a big light bulb. I first thought it was coming from the plane&apos;s strobing lights but when it happened again i could tell that it was un-naturaly bright. And was moving with the plane and not stationary as i first thought.  It was visibile that it is a rectangular shape flying just above the ground illuminating the ground as it hovered above land with its very special bright pure white (not yellowish as the rest of Cairo&apos;s other artificial lights). It happened 4 or 5 times between 11:30 and 11:45 then we landed in Cairo Airport and i forgot all about it till I heared Omar&apos;s story.&quot;  [the writer also discribes another incident] where another male was ubducted into a UFO while he was sleeping in an empty lot in southern Egypt. when he saw a landing UFO and creatures came out and took him inside on an operation table where he was exposed to some rays, later after this insident he started having strange powers like eating and swallowing broken glass and inserting a nail in parts of his body and taking it out from the other side without any trace of blood.  And he demonstrated those powers in my office infront of my own eyes. Omar also started feeling those strange powers, for example sometimes if he just rests his hand on one of his friends that person could fall down to the ground with extreme pain!  Lately he started noticing that when he holds a cola glass bottle in his hand, the liquid will turn into frozen ice in the middle of the bottle, while stays as liquid above and bellow the area where Omar was holding it. Omar also continues that when he saw the fire ball years back, his brother was sleeping in the next bed and didn&apos;t see the ball, but when the fire ball crossed infront of the bedroom window the sleeping brother punched the air upwards with his fist while still sleeping. And in after the light dissapeared in few seconds his arm went back to his side whithout waking up. Omar remembers that during this incident there was a ringing or beeping sound coming from the tin trash bin in the same bedroom.  The sound was similar to the effect resulting of hitting the tin with another metal piece.&quot;", "I was outside taking pictures of some horses before lunch and there was a light in the sky and as it moved it left a trail with points of stop that you could see and when it was finished it looked like a snake then disappeared.

Only one saw it before it went below the horizon.", "cigar shaped object with colors of orange, blue and green that changed colors in a strobe from orange to blue to green over and over.It was lightly snowing and dark there was one object, it looked sort of like a cigar but with two bumps on the top.  It was three colors: bright orange on the bumps, a bright blue middle stripe, and the bottom was green.  It would start with the bumps on the top bright orange, then the blue would be the brightest, then the green and it would keep rotation the brightness of the colors.  I was driving on I-70 between Denver and Golden, headed to Golden.  I saw it from the left side of the car at about eye level.  My car engine died and would not start until the thing disapeared.  I stayed there for about 20 minutes with the colors kind of in a strobe mode from the top to the bottom in order of brightness.  I was eighteen and headed to Golden to get my graduation pictures for the school album.  After 20 minutes it just kind of faded away.  There were no sounds.  I have only told this to one other person until now.  I will send a crude drawing, it would be impossible to really draw it.", "We saw a large object that was bright yellow with five or six white lights shining from it, that completely disappeared before our eyesMy friend was outside feeding our animals. When she came back in she told me to look out the window. I did and we saw a large object that was bright yellow with five or six white lights shining from it. It was North West from my house in Concrete Washington. I called my mom to look at it, but she couldn&apos;t see it from her house. It started really high and as we watched, it dropped below the trees. Suddenly it started flickering, it would completely go out and then get bright again. It did this for approx. ten minutes. It then got higher again and got really bright before completely disappearing. I have never seen anything like this before or since. I do not know what a star looks like when it goes out so it might have been something like that. I asked my dad and he said it could have been a super nova, but there have been no reports of this. I have checked.((NUFORC Note:  We have written the witness, and invited her to explore whether she might have been looking at Venus.

We were laying on deck chairs facing the sky. My dog was on my lap and she could not take her eyes off the sky. Looking passed her gaze, I saw five huge spheres in the distance silently gliding rapidly and gracefully above me, having come from the direction of the pier. I was struck at first watching them. Then I alerted my boyfriend and he saw them too. We watched them as they headed north out of our view. At first thought we both thought they were bubbles. But, no way they were too big. Then balloons entered our minds, but no way. They didn&apos;t move like balloons. They were in formation and they were gliding rapidly in a straight line (faster than the planes in the sky) in uniform across the sky. They gave off no noise. They weren&apos;t giving off any reflective light. They were transparent, but they clearly had a shape to them like soap bubbles.", "Mexico Air Force video creates UFO stirFrom Reuters   5/11/04  Are you aware of this report?  MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican Air Force has released footage of what a UFO expert said were 11 invisible unidentified flying objects picked up by an infrared camera as they whizzed around a surveillance plane.A long-time believer in flying saucers, journalist Jaime Maussan told a news conference Tuesday the objects were real and seemed &quot;intelligent&quot; after they at one point changed direction and surrounded the plane chasing them.&quot;They were invisible to the eye but they were there, there is no doubt about it. They had mass, they had energy and they were moving about,&quot; he said, after showing a 15-minute video he said the Defense Ministry gave him permission to publicize.The ministry confirmed to Reuters it had provided the video, filmed by the Air Force on March 5 over the eastern coastal state of Campeche.&quot;We are not alone! This is so weird,&quot; one of the pilots can be heard yelling, after the plane&apos;s crew switched on an infrared camera to track the objects, first picked up by radar.The film, recorded by a plane looking for drugs trafficking near the Gulf of Mexico, shows 11 objects as blobs of light that hover in formation or dart about, sometimes disappearing into cloud.Mexico&apos;s most popular nightly news broadcast showed the video Monday night.Interviewed by Mausson on another section of the video, the pilots said they grew nervous when the objects, still invisible, turned back during a chase and surrounded the plane.&quot;There was a moment when ... the screens showed they were behind us, to the left and in front of us. It was at that point that I felt a bit tense,&quot; said Maj.

The sky was clear and there were many stars out.We were outside of Shelby about 2 miles so there werent many lights other than the background light from the stars.We were on a road with very rough railroad tracks so we were almost at a stand-still at the time. Something caught my eye and I looked up. It was a huge triangular shaped object I estimate to have been maybe 50 feet on a side. It traveled right over the car we were in and only about20 to 25 feet above us and moving very slow. Too slow it seemed to stay airborne.It had no lights on it and the only sound heard was the sound of something slicing through the air. No motor or propulsion noise.We  were able to make out the shape due to the background lighting.We sat and watched it for 5 to 10 minutes until it disappeared beyond some trees in the distance.It never changed direction or altitude that we could tell.

She pointed it out to me as it was moving slowly toward our location. It appeared to stay just above the treeline. It was an orange bulb in an oval shape. It was not overly luminous because it had a medium tone. It had no trail and made no sound. I lost sight of it...as it got to what seemed to be about 1000 feet from us. It then moved to the left, back to the right, and then I lost sight of it. At its last location, it should have become completely visible in only a few seconds if it had maintained its speed.

There were no lights and nothing on the objects moved or changed, they all glowed with the same faint greenish white glow, hazy around the edges.

Good long view, good details.My father and Uncle took me along on an evening fishing trip. I have clear memories of this evening...even to the clothes I was wearing. I remember I sat in the ashes of a previous campfire and my father told me that my mom was going to spank me for ruining my clothes. We were sitting on the river bank with my father on my right side and my Uncle on my left. My Uncle had a clear space on his left, but my father had a large tree (oak?) on his right. It was leaning out over the water as river-bank trees are wont to do. As a result of this every so often, my fathers line would snag in the overhanging tree branches. He would curse and reel the line back in. Although there were trees to the sides of our spot, there were none directly over head. My father had just cast his line and it must have snagged the tree, because something made him look up. I felt him go very still. He nudged me and said &quot;K., look up.&quot; I looked up and directly over our heads was a very large flying saucer. It looked as big as a house....bigger. I could see that it was bigger than the relative size of the large tree beside my father...even at the height it was at. Which seemed to be not much higher than the tree top. The sky was black and there was no moon that I recall or could see, but I could see this object very clearly. Obviously it was round. It had 6 round white lights on the bottom. 5 surrounding one, all the same size, and the 5 rotated counter-clockwise. It was dead silent. It was a silvery pewter color. Not shiny, and as I recall with....seams in the metal. In other words, it was not a perfectly smooth skin. I knew I was seeing something extrodinary, but I wasn&apos;t the least bit frightened. We watched it as it crossed the river. As it got about half way across, I saw that it was a shallow dome, like a lens. But instead of a smooth top, it had a little bump on top. A true dome that sat in the center of the ship. One the right upper side of the dome was a white light. The color of an incandescent light bulb.

Then it hovered for just a moment. Then it just dropped slowly into the woods. I looked at my father. He was still looking across the river. I guess they figured that they were far enough away, because as I recall, my father and uncle kept right on fishing. As I was young and it was late, I don&apos;t recall going home.

Although the &quot;pulses&quot; were steady (like that of an airplane), there was no symetry.  The flashes did not match what you would have expected on an airplane&apos;s wings, or a helicopter&apos;s.

It was hard to keep my eyes from the sky, and I didn&apos;t really try to estimate the size of the crowd at the time. There was very little talking, most of it was in hushed voices when at all. After a few minutes a very small light came out of one of the larger ones and zoomed across the sky to the horizon, at such an amazing speed that it was incomprehensible. The guy next to us said the only other words he ever said to us then, &quot;There&apos;s been a lot of those.&quot; Maybe 4 or 5 minutes later the little light came back from another direction. After that several more from various directions. They would just appear on the horizon and zoom back to the main lights and sort of merge with one or the other.

It may have been as many as forty minutes that we stood and watched this, until finally, little lights began coming from every direction of the horizon. I didn&apos;t try to count them, I was simply in awe, but there were many, maybe 20, maybe as many as a hundred. They were all moving so fast, impossibly fast, taking maybe as little as 7 seconds from horizon to the main lights.

PD))", "watched lights for 20 minutes in the desert.Myself and two other friends were Varmit calling the night of march 23 in the Hasiampa river bottom west of Surprise,Az. we had taken Sun Valley parkway around the whwhite tank mountains (west) then into the dry river bottom. we like to call at night from the back of a pick up to locate any locations of preadtors then come back the next day and hunt there. We had headed south and had made 3 stops to call some 15 minutes each time. I have been around and in this wash all of my life, I ride my quads with my family in it 20 or so times a year. I know every bend and every part of that area. On the 4 stop while still moving south slowly I saw thur the tree&apos;s 2 light that appeared in the sky just ahead of us. They weren&apos;t there a few minutes ago but they were there now! Eric stopped the truck and we all got out and watched the lights. that were perfectly still bright yellow orangish color and very big. I know this area there is nothing out here except a few high line wires but these light were much too high to be the lines and I know they dont have lights on them anyway. I climbed up onto the truck and looked at the with a rifle scope and couldn&apos;t see anything except lights. I am a Vietnam veteran and I know chopper lights and chopper sounds.these were NOT choppers. I have shot flares off hundreds of flares in Vietnam. Flares swing down and leave a smoke trail.These lights were NOT flares. As I stood on the truck I could see the ground was lit up under them I couldn&apos;t see any lights from them but the ground was Illumated anyway. I estimate we were at least 1/2 mile from thse lights maybe more its had to tell at night. the boys got real scared and wanted to leave so we started the truck and headed back the way we came. as we were traveling north up the wash Eric the driver saw these two light go out! we stopped and looked again then they came back on. As we watch them again I now saw another light to the west of them across the wash several miles away. Then the lights went off again. We headed ! north again stopping at a fence gate as I got out the lights had came back on for the third time and were in the same place. We left the wash and headed east toward sun valley parkway watching these lights all the way. As we approached the highway we stopped and looked thur the scope again to see if we could tell what this was.We could see very clearly the light of the Palo Verde power plant to the west of the lights. I tried to pin point where their location was and the best estimate I have is east of the power plant and west of White tank mountains. I dont have any other explanation other than this was a UFO..I have elmiated all possible causes in my mind.Planes,choppers and flares. as we drove north we saw these lights untill the road went around the mountain and we couldn&apos;t see them any longer. I wish I could have talked these scared boys into going south on the highway to get closer but they were just to shook up to go.  this must of been a UFO!! I have who friend asked me to put this on here. It is very interesting there was another report about these lights on the same date and almost the same time. Thanks for listening John", "Large bright light appeared in sky  overhead and then quickly dropped down out of my sight.I was sitting outside in my hammock reading a book when I suddenly saw a large, bright light in the sky. It seemed to have a glow around it, also. It didn&apos;t appear to have come from anywhere, it was just suddenly there. Then it appeared as if it started to fall. My first thought was a falling star but it was way too big and had no tail or anything like that. It moved very quickly. By the time I got out of the hammock and ran to the middle of the patio for a better look, it was gone. There were no sounds of aircraft. I do live between 2 small airfields but I have not seen anything move that fast, that was that big without any sound at all. This is the first ufo report I have ever filed. I can&apos;t think what this could have been which is what prompted me to do this. I am hoping someone else reports it also just so I know I didn&apos;t imagine it. My dog started barking at the same time also. So, did both the neighbors dogs, now I think of it. As for my background, I am just your average Joan, reading a book in the backyard, enjoying a nice evening before it gets unbearably hot. Since it was dark, I did have the patio light on. I also had my glasses on. I even questioned if perhaps there had been some wierd reflection but I could not recreate anything that even came close to it. I am not prone to fabrication. I am very science oriented as my entire adult life has been spent in medicine. All science and facts. Thanks.", "While viewing Venus, off to the left and higher, it appeared at first to be a shooting star.  It was a very bright white light with no tail.  It started in an arc comming down at an approx. 45 degree angle, then it started to zig zag.  The object stopped in the trees at least 20 seconds.  I went to get my camera upon returning it was gone.  Event lasted approx. 2 minutes.", "It was about 7:30pm, the date really escapes me at the moment, I was 15 years old and headed out to my friend&apos;s house near Lake Ave. in Yonkers, NY. I lived near Central Ave. and Tuckahoe Rd. . My mom walked me out to throw the trash when we saw my neighbor from accross the street and his dog just standing there looking up at the sky. When we got to the end of the driveway we saw this ENORMOUS craft hovering silently in the sky. This object was atleast the size of an aircraft carrier and about 7 or 8 stories tall and the sky was crystal clear. It was lighted but the lights were strange and &quot;flashed&quot; in a pattern that made them appear as though they wer circling the craft. It was mettalic like a brushed aluminum or stainless steel with a very low gloss finish.We just stood there in aw when my mom suggested that I run accross the street to my uncle&apos;s house for a camera. My uncle always had a loaded camera on hand and he had offered to drive me to my friend&apos;s house. When I arrived at his house I yelled up to his window and told him whatr we were looking at. Being my uncle he did not pay any attention to me and assumed that I was trying to rush him to give me a lift. As I pleaded for the camera the object began to move slowly SW. Not wanting to loose sight of it I ran back to the position my mom and my neighbor were at and climbed a tree as the craft began to move beyond our sight. I watched as it moved past some apartment buildings located on Palmer Rd. and noted that it was lower that the buildings which would put it at about 50-75 yards in the air since the buildings sit on a hill.I kept an eye on it until it disapeared behind the tree-line still moving SW.O.K. this is where it should end right? Well, my uncle finally comes out with the camera and asks what all the xciment was about...I told him as we drove across Tuckahoe Rd. and eventually up Lake Ave. from Saw Mill River Rd.. Just as we approached Lake there were people stopped and getting out of their cars looking toward the sky. We of course stopped and saw a series of green lights in a formation very much shaped like a kite. As these lights passed overhead we could hear humming.As I explained that this was not what I had seen a few minutes earlier the lights reappeared and seemed to be circling over the city. When I arrived at my friend&apos;s house we snapped a photo of these lights with a crappy poliroid, (they circled for about an hour), and then being a not-unintelligent child, I ran into my friend&apos;s house and called the operator for the FBI&apos;s #..LOL...The kicker is that I actually got to talk to someone in some office of the FBI who put me on hold for a min. or two and returned, telling me that there were marines choppers on manuvers over Yonkers that night. I insisted that perhaps the green lights were marines but that the first object was certainly not. They of course blew me off and said they had no further info. What the heck were marine&apos;s flying over Yonkers when the closest base at the time was 1  1/2 hours away in NJ???((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As I was saying goodbye to a security guard, a cylindrical object came down from the South East above a park across the street.  The security guard and I didn&apos;t see it until it was about 30 ft about the park because of a cover over the passenger dropoff point.  The object hovered above the park changing color from blue to white and blue again.  The object seemed to be made up of a single glowing light source.  There was absolutely no sound emitted from the object.  The hair stood up on my neck, and I looked at the security guard.  He was staring right at the object.  After I looked back at the object, it made its final color change and almost instantly lift back up into the sky.  We could not see where it went because of the cover on the passenger dropoff. A few words were exchanged between us as we left.  I took a cab home that night rather than walking.  Now the security guard refuses to acknowledge this happened.  When I try talking about it, he says he doesn&apos;t know what I&apos;m talking about.((NUFORC Note:  We have invited the witness to have the other individual submit a report, as well.  We are awaiting a graphic from the witness, illustrating what it was he saw.  PD))", "I just finished reading the Woodbridge, New Jersey &quot;Shape Changer&quot; article in Filers Files #21 and it is almost exactly like my sighting in April or May 1997.  I hope the writer of that report can read my sighting below, from my personal UFO Journal and know he or she is not alone in seeing this type of shape changing object.  Thank you. Gil Rodriguez  1997 - 16. Spring - April or May. I lived at my present address of 640 East 79th St. between Glenwood &amp; Farrigut Roads. While finishing up a long walk, one morning about 11:30 am, I had the urge to look behind me (a soft (mechanical sounding) voice said &quot;LOOK UP&quot;) and I saw a large dark (very dark gray to black) doughnut shaped object moving in the sky over my left shoulder. It was over to the North West, a few blocks up around Utica and Foster Avenues when first sighted. I could see the sky through the center of this object. It looked to be 2000 to 5000 feet above the area. After a few seconds it moved over with a fast jump or dart like movement and was almost directly over Glenwood Road where I was walking as it changed shape several times from a doughnut to a cigar shape with the front 1/5 of its length bent back, then it became a straight cigar or cylinder shape, then a chevron shape. It made a jump or move down quickly over the street (maybe 500 feet up) and looked at least as wide as the street (Glenwood Road) I was walking on (it had now changed into a cigar/cylinder shape). After changing again into a chevron, it changed into a figure eight. The exact shapes it changed into, the sequence, I have drawn on paper from that day with a letter I eventually sent to Sightings and Encounters. (I never heard from either show). I somehow had the impression that this thing was alive or that it was some kind of creature, especially when it was cigar shaped with the front 1/5 section bent back. During this time there were about 5 people on the street within the next two to three blocks who were looking at it and pointing. One guy yelled out &quot;what the hell is that&quot; when it was shaped like a figure eight. I was thinking at this time that if I ran home, I could get my video camera and get some video of it. The object stayed ahead of me as I ran. I ran the remaining six or seven blocks home and went inside calling my wife, mother-in-law and daughter frantically to come outside and see this UFO. I went back outside! and was joined by my daughter, my wife and mother-in-law (there voices can be heard on the tape). I taped for about 54 seconds where you see it changing shape three times before it moved into the clouds. You can see it change into a chevron, a ball or disk and finally a dark/black cigar/cylinder shape before moving into the clouds (my daughter is heard saying &quot; it&rsquo;s going into the clouds&quot;). Today, 1/03/03 I remembered that my first thought was that it was a long string of large black balloons that might have flown off from a parade or a street fair, but the shapes it made especially when it came down over the block (Glenwood Avenue) I was walking on (doughnut, cylinder, chevron and figure eight) made it look like one solid object, with no segments.", "Bright light in sky transforms into barbell-shaped craft, descends and rotates silently overhead.On the evening of July 17, 1996 I was travelling by car from Ann Arbor, MI to Saline, MI when I spied a bright white light under the low cloud cover to the south at about twenty degrees latitude.  I had the am radio tuned in to 760 WJR (Detroit, MI) to listen to the breaking news reports of the TWA 800 crash off of Long Island, NY.  This light was much larger and brighter than the landing lights on the passenger jets which continually fly in and out of Willow Run Airport (Ypsilanti, MI).  Two night previous (July 15th) I had witnessed a large circular array of lights float over my car from east to west in the same area at about the same time of night.  I wondered if I was witnessing a routine flight out of Willow Run Airport of an unconventional aircraft.  I felt somewhat agitated at the sight of this bright light, yet, drawn to it.  I turned my car onto a series of sideroads in order to get closer look at it.  After five or so minutes the light was much larger in size and was about sixty degrees in latitude.  I was on the northern outskirts of the tiny town of Bridgewater, MI when I stopped my car, exited it to see the huge bright light descend out of the sky toward my position.  The light dimmed dramatically to reveal a barbell-shaped craft comprised of two internally-lit, milky white spheres connected by a thin bar which had two, evenly spaced, bright bluish-white blinking lights.  These lights blinked in unison at regular intervals much the way that aircraft strobes blink.  The craft was huge.  It revolved horizontally on an axis and was completely silent.  I measured the craft to be the size of a large canteloupe or human head at arm&apos;s length.  At this time I noticed that several cars were passing by, both on the road which I was parked on the shoulder of as well as a nearby state highway that ran through Bridgewater.  Not a single car seemed to stop or notice this object.  I attempted to motion down a passing truck with one hand while pointing to the object with the other but the d! river seemed to not see me.  The craft continued to revolve and occasionally one of the internally-lit spheres would slowly extinguish its light and after a few seconds it would re-illuminate.  Each time that this occurred I felt a flood of anxiety.  Finally, after about five or so minutes of this dramatic display, the craft slowly ascended into the sky, became a bright single white light and moved off to the south east at a slow rate.  I felt as if this sighting was meant solely for me.  I did not notice any EM problems related to my vehicle or static on the AM radio through the duration of the sighting.", "Brilliant object  moving at right angles at high speed from the ground, instant acceleration!I am a 52 year old power company lineman with four children and one grandchild. I have never really believed in UFOs or anything of that nature. No Proof. What me and my fellow worker saw on a totaly bright, sunny afternoon in upstate New York, blew my mind! We have only mentioned it once to our co-workers (which was met with laughter) and to our own families (with raised eye brows from them).The two of us don&apos;t even mention it anymore to each other but it has bothered me for over 20 years.

I have never seen anything like what I am about to describe to you.I never wrote the date down but I think the month and year may be close. As we were driving south on Interstate Route 81 just about a half mile north of the Preble exit we both saw ,at the same time, A tremendously brilliant (chrome like/brilliant white) object with no decernable shape, possibly round about the size of a small car, slowly rise straight from the ground to a height of about two hundred feet, pause fo a second and then accelorate instantly at a slight angle from east to west over the southbound exit at Preble. It went from a DEAD STOP to instant acceleration. A BLUR in a fraction of a second. We could see the blur for about the first hundred feet or so. I know of nothing that could stand those forces. I was the passenger in the car and my buddy was the driver. We both looked at each other and I said to him &quot;did you see that?&quot; He said &quot; I didn&apos;t see anything like that&quot;, as if to say he wasn&apos;t going to repeat it. This was the middle of the day! Other people had to have seen it too. I still see the event clearly in my mind as if it were yesterday. I never said to anyone that it was a &quot;fling saucer&quot; or anything of that nature. I don&apos;t know what it was, but is WAS THERE. We both saw it and I&apos;ll swear to the Pope and to God himself what I just described to you. I&apos;m a very private person and I DO NOT want any press on this. I&apos;d tell them that I never saw it but someone should be investigating these things.

Husband/passenger was asleep. One vehicle behind me. No other traffic. Clear night, lots of stars. Saw a bright bluish &quot;star&quot; about 50-degree angle directly ahead in the night sky, which didn&apos;t twinkle and appeared to be getting larger. Within approx. 30 seconds, it had gotten as large as a &quot;dime&quot; and was getting larger and lower and glowing a bluish color. I couldn&apos;t figure out what it was. Within another 5 to 10 seconds it had gotten approx. the size of a dinner plate and appeared to be descending and coming straight at me even though it was still approx. 15 degrees up. I started yelling at my husband to wake up, as I was terrified. Within a couple of seconds it was directly in front of me at approx. 1000 ft. elevation and was enormous. It extended beyond both sides of the highway by at least 100 feet and completely silent. I could see it was round and flat, appeared metallic and was glowing a bright bluish color. I started screaming. It lit up the road like bluish daylight. It passed slightly to my right over a ridge of low mountains and crashed. There was a huge bluish light and the impact lifted my car off the road and over into the next lane, almost off the road. I pulled over, and the guy behind me pulled over, and we got out and tried to see if we could see anything, but all you could see was this huge bluish glow. The guy was just as shocked as I was. My husband had only seen it when it was right on top of us. We (both cars) drove into Barstow and went to the Highway Patrol and told them what we had seen. They said they hadn&apos;t heard about anything crashing, but they would look into it. My husband drove home because I was too shaky to drive. I called the CHP the next day. They said they were &quot;still checking it out.&quot; I called CalTech to see if the crash had registered anything, and they said they had nothing registering at that time, but they would look into it. I called Edwards Air Force Base, and they sai! d that a small plane had crashed into the mountains, but they had no info and said to call the FAA. I called FAA and they said they didn&apos;t know about any plane crash. There was nothing on the news. I told people about it, but nobody had heard anything.

It was just east of due north and 60 dagrees above the horizon and it appeared to be falling at a downward angle drifting eastward of straight down.  I was at first convinced it was a door from a jet plane, then realized it was much too reflective-mirror-like to be a painted surface.  As I started to calculate where it would land, it stopped dead in the air, instantly.  I then realized several things; it was much larger and farther away than I originally thought, and the shape of it was in reality 2 pyramids base to base, with mirrored surfaces.  The diamond shape appeared to be revolving, in place, at about 60 cycles per second (a rough guess), and was oriented vertically,straight up and down.  Just as I was trying to guess the size of it (about the size of my index fingernail held at arms length) some of the few small clouds that were in the sky drifted in front of it, it then started &quot;falling&quot; again.  It was then I realized it was not falling at all, but it was moving across the sky as a satellite would at night, it sparkled and moved in that easterly direction, getting slightly smaller, until the tree line at the horizon obscured it.  When it was gone I was dumbstruck and tried to reason that I had seen a large satellite in the middle of the day?  If so, it had to have been huge, and have the ability to stop instantly, and the diamond shape was absolutely unmistakable, it was easily seen with the naked eye.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This is when I realized how beautiful the day was. I decided to face south with the sun at my back. This would allow me to look up and admire the beautiful sky that had no clouds or haze. As I was looking at the sky I saw to what I thought was a star. I said to myself &quot;Wow the sky is so clear I can see a star.&quot;  The star was in the 11:00 position in the sky. I continued to look at it for approximately 5 minutes when the phone rang. My brother said the phone call was for me. I told him to come out and keep your eyes on this while I answer the phone. He came out and said Wow it&apos;s so clear you can see a star. I said I know, that&apos;s what I said.As soon as I got on the phone he started screaming, &quot;It&apos;s Moving ... It&apos;s Moving&quot;  I ran out and was shocked to see it moving very slowly South heading to the 2:00 position in the sky. I told my brother to hurry up and get my telescope. I immediately put the small spotter scope on it then I was able to get it immediately in the large scope. To my shock and surprise I saw very clearly a round object that was silver at the top and glowing orange and yellow at the bottom. I screamed &quot;It&apos;s a UFO&quot;  The UFO was moving very slow as I was following it. Then suddenly my brother started screaming there&apos;s another one. I looked away from the telescope and saw 5 more UFO&apos;s directly behind the one I originally saw, only now you can see the difference in size.The other 5 UFO&apos;s now look like small dots in comparison to the first one. They were all evenly spaced and started to move a bit faster south when Suddenly they all Bolted across the sky from the 12:00 position in the sky to the 2:00 position in the sky in a flash. They looked to be at least 34 thousand feet up. Then they all stopped at once still evenly spaced at the 2:00 position. Then they dropped down to the 3:00 position and all stopped then all went back up to the 2:00 position all stopped then all shot out at once South West at the 1:00 position faster than a flash of light. Gone Forever. We were all very excited to be a witness to this UFO sighting. My Brother, Sister, and two of my brothers friends. After everything was over I sat down by myself and reflected on what I just saw. That&apos;s when I was hit with flashes of information. I was suddenly taken off this planet looking at it disappear in the vastness of space. I was suddenly outside our universe. It looked like a black ball floating in a dimension of white energy. As I went further back I realized the white energy is also a bubble, only extremely large and still growing. There were other Black bubbles within the white. The other black bubbles are other universes. Some were large and others were smaller then our own. The larger the bubble the older the universe and the more advanced life is within. The most advanced beings were able to travel between universes. They were beings of light able to exist in all dimensions. As I got taken even further back it came to an endless field of black. The extremely large whit bubble was in this endless field of black. However this endless field of black was not black at all, it was such a high frequency it would show up in our spectrum as black however it is the brightest white and most intelligent and was the first spark of existence. This Frequency always was and always will be. This frequency is so intelligent, it deliberately designed our existence by putting frequencies together that would create our universe and matter then us. From seeing this I understood the following. 1. Our universe is in the 3rd dimension of matter. 2. Our universe sits inside the 2nd dimension of Frequency and energy. 3. The endless field of black that the 2nd dimension sits inside the high intelligent frequency. 4. How frequency and energy was created to push open the third dimension of matter. (Our Universe.)  5. As Frequency and energy radiated through the empty universe, it collected on to itself creating matter. 6. I understood what creates gravity. 7. How to repel it. 8. How to have instant communication from one universe to another universe at real time. 9. How to collect free energy.

We are in the souther hemisphere and this was about 20 degrees north of vertical.  I thought it was a bit odd so I looked at it for about a minute or two.  Their were two or three stars around it so I could determine it was stationary or possibly moving away from me.  Then it dimmed significantly and began to move directly north looking much like a satilite does when in sunlight.  It disappeared after travelling across the night sky for about 30 seconds.  This was even stranger as satilites that are commonly seen in Australia always travel from West to East and are never stationary then move.  I can only speculate that it was a stationary satilite that conducted a burn to move into a higher orbit ?", "Sighting similar to cross-shaped light formations seen on  03/12/00 and 04/15/04Similar to earlier sighting on 3/12/00 and 4/15/04.

It was around 8 I&apos;m guessing, but either way the sun was setting to our right, and in front of us, above the treeline, it looked like a glowing blue orb thing in the sky about a mile away. I pointed it to my sister and she wondered what it was also. We kept driving and the treeline hid the object, when I came to the top of another small hill and saw it again, very clearly, but then the treeline hid it again and then I didn&apos;t see it again. It looked pretty big, maybe 60-100ft at what looked like a mile away. It was pretty low in the sky, and was a kind of luminous light blue color, and it seemed a little darker around the edges.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Me my father my brother and a friend were driving home from a football game. My father and I first saw a green triangular shap light from a distance shoot down as if it were falling from the sky. I shot down very fast. We saw it for about 2 seconds. As soon as I was about to say something we saw four lights to the east of us. We were going North. The lights were diagonal flashing in a domino affect. The lights were a bright fire looking color like the color of a lighter flam. They danced in the sky in the same pattern for about a minute it. The length of the lights given the distance from the sky looked about 40 to 50 yards long. The lights disapeard with no fading or dimering just disapeared. Like I said the light show only lasted for 1 min. I don&apos;t know if the green triangular shape was the same thing we say from the east of us or if they were two different objects. The date should be right because I wrote it down the same day it happend.", "Two spheres or discs flying parallel in the skyPerhaps this is related to the account on the same evening from the airliner crew over Omaha, NE. This is what I witnessed in the sky over Toronto on Mar 25, 2004 at 6:30 pm EST, and I would like to preface this by saying my eyesight is much better than 20/20, especially when viewing something long distance:   Two small (10 feet in diameter at the most) black or dark coloured orbs/spheres or discs in the sky, floating (I would say flying but they were wingless) silently and parallel to each other, from west to east following identical flight paths and speed.  The more southern of the two was perhaps (estimate) 20 or 30 full size passenger plane lengths ahead of the other.  Due to the formation I kept looking to see if there was a 3rd object where one would expect it be (the 3rd point in the hypothetical triangle) but there certainly was not.  I also kept looking between the two discs to see if they were connected by anything visible, but again, nothing but the cloud above them was seen. I could hear various air traffic above me that evening but not see any airplanes as the clouds were quite low, yet these objects were beneath the cloud cover.  When they were a fair distance away from me and I had a more &quot;head on&quot; angle view to them I noticed they appeared to be gyrating in the manner in which a bullet travels down a barrel of a gun (tight spirals) as it moves forward.  Eventually they just became too far away to see.

July 31, 1984 10-pm sighting Middlebury CT over Police tower I-84 next to South St. arch bridgeI had an experience in 1984 I will never forget. My name is ((name deleted)). I am now 44, in 1984 I was 24, and at the time I was a D-J at a radio station in central Connecticut. It was a Sunday night, summertime, I know it was July 31st, 1984. I had just visited my parents, watched 60 minutes (thats how I remember it was a Sunday night; at the time I remember thinking it was at the beginning of the month, but I looked it up on a perpetual calendar and realized it was a few hours before August 1st.) and I watched a movie with them, and left about 10 o&apos;clock and drove home on I-84. My parents lived in Newtown and I in Waterbury. Driving up thru Middlebury, past exit 16, I saw what I thought was a plane coming down fast to my right, in the corner of my eye. As I drove up a grade, the &quot;plane&quot; came down over some pine trees, and I was approaching a large Arch bridge in front of me about a quarter of a mile ahead. The &quot;plane&quot;  &quot;stopped on a dime&quot; instantaneously above the bridge !  For about 1/8th of a second I thought it was a military jet called a VTOL  (Vertical take off or landing) -- there is Oxford airport about a mile away to my right at this point -- and so I thought, &quot;Oh !  A  VTOL !!&quot;  And then, in that 1/8th of a second, my heart came up into my throat !!!  It&apos;s not a VTOL but a freakin&apos; UFO  !!! And I am driving at 65 m.p.h. -- RIGHT TOWARDS IT !!!   It scared the ((deleted)) me so much I was trying in those few seconds to figure out how to turn around, but the ditch to the other side of the highway was too steep, I&apos;d get stuck in my Ford Escort if I tried it. So, my next thought was to floor it --- fly at high speed right under the bridge and UFO -- but as I got up to it, I was then thinking, this might be the ONLY chance I ever get to see something like this, so I mustered all my nerve and found a place to pull over. I sat there for what I thought was 15 minutes, virtually frozen in my seat, scared to death, watching this thing move slowly to the other side of the highway over a large police radio tower next to the bridge ...  it was only a few hundred feet from me... I felt I could have hit it with a rock or a baseball if I&apos;d had the nerve. Well, it hovered, turned -- rotated, actually -- very slowly, and I unwound my window and heard NO sound, just crickets and cars passing by. I looked at two as they went by, I remember seeing the people looking up at it, and thinking I wasn&apos;t the only person seeing this. The proverbial &quot;deer in the headlights&quot; phrase kept going thru my mind. It was larger than a two-story house, just floating there, and I definitely had the feeling I was being watched, I was NEVER so scared in my entire life. It had what looked like a notch cut out of one side of it, otherwise it seemed almost round, but there were actually flat sides to it, like a dodecahedron, with what I would describe as xmas tree lights all over it, but much more brighter and more brilliant, brilliant colors of blue, red, yellow, purple, all kinds of colors. I could also see what looked like metal-work on it behind the lights, like, beams or something, and I remember thinking WOW, this is something not made on this planet ! The thing floated there for 15 minutes, or so I thought.... because it then moved slowly away, disappeared over a hill, and I drove home, went up to my apartment, drained from this, but I couldn&apos;t sleep, so I sat down in my dark apartment at my kitchen table, sat there for what I thought was 10 -15 mins., looked at my watch and was stunned to see it was 3:30 am !!   So what happened to the time ?? I still do not know, I am now looking into some hypnosis sessions to find out what happened, my sister knows a woman who does hypnosis. Anyway, although the experience scared the living crap out of me at the time, I was glad to have experienced it because it gave me insight into the fact that not only are we NOT alone, but that how insignificant things can be on this lonely little planet in a corner of the Universe in the grand scheme of things. Not that things aren&apos;t important here, but just to know that there are many other things going on we have NO clue about in the vastness of space. And not only that, but at least I &quot;know&quot; in my heart what &quot;I saw&quot;  and no one can take that away from me,even if they don&apos;t believe me at least I believe what I myself saw. The next night, I got on the radio and asked if anyone had seen anything and got 4 or 5 calls from people who&apos;d seen similar looking UFOs the night before, one down near the Merritt Parkway and another near Waterbury I remember.", "the triangular shaped craft chased each other, turning at sharp angles and then left in a straight line at incredible speedI was one of a group of soldiers, sitting and lying in the grass, awaiting our turn to be processed for discharged.  I lay on my back and looked straight up to see two triangular craft manuvering as if they were having an aerial dog fight.  They would turn at sharp angles.  The sky was very clear.  They were so high they looked very small.  After manuvering around for awhile overhead they went off in a straight line so fast they were gone within a second.  This was a couple or three days before I was discharged on May 15, 1950.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I just figured it was a new construction site that had just gone up the day before, and someone was building a new factory or something. when I arrived at the same hill and looked south, there was nothing at all.I slowed down and looked as well as I could at the whole area...nothing. that was a few weeks ago , I still go that way every other night and havent seen it since.", "Round, tall craft over Catalina Island, two teardrop black crafts inter-weaving with another at low altitudeWe were coming home after a fishing trip to Catalina Island on the backside of the island.  It was getting dark, so we decided to head home.  We were on a 22ft center console fishing boat.  As we turned the eastside of the island and started heading toward the Angels gate in LA Harbor, I looked to the west and noticed a circular craft in the air at approx. 5000 ft to the north side of the island ( which is actually the front side).  I have been very interested in the UFO Phenomenom for 15 yrs now and have spoken to people concerning the subject.  However I never had a sighting. That is why when I looked up at the object in the sky I kinda questioned it immediately.  It was circular, but taller.  I had extremely bright lights around and on top of it. I watched the object while I held on to the boat( as we were coming in, approx. 14 knots.)   It seemed to hover moving eastward, moving along the frontside of the island.  I couldn&apos;t believe that what I saw in the air was not a craft that I could describe.  My brother&apos;s a private pilot and we have no problem identifying airplanes and blimps (Goodyear Blimp right down the street).  I am a space enthusiast as well so when this object appeared, I was downright purplexed.  What the hell is that?, I said to my self.  As I said in the duration, I watched the object for a few minutes and then said to the captain and my brother who were also on the boat,  &quot;hey look at that&quot;.  Immediately the captain said &quot;that looks like a UFO&quot;.  I almost fell out because he shared the same interpretation as I did, without me bring up the UFO possibilty.  He was driving the boat and it was getting dark so his immediate focus was keeping the boat safe, nevertheless, I kept watching the craft.  Before I knew it, the craft shot straight up into the sky extremely FAST and then disappered.  I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.  If this was a real sighting , I saw what everyone is talking about.  Please understand this is not a hoax.  I would never spend my time li! ke this over something that did not happen.  I just saw a report of the Mexican 11 UFO&apos;s all over the news and it inspired me to report this. I also have another incident to report, that I experienced traveling south on Pacific Coast Highway in the City of Torrace, CA.  I was coming home from my business and was going home which is in Harbor City. This was approximately 6pm and was in late 2003, before the daylight savings time change.  I was driving normally, traffic on PCH was normal and I had just passed Crenshaw BLVD. As I got to Pennsylvania Ave, I noticed three lights coming from the east going westbound, like they were on approach to Torrance Airport. As I mentioned, my twin brother is a private pilot and achieved his license at Torrance Airport, so I am very familiar with the traffic of planes coming in for landings.  I could help but notice that the two lights on the outside were much brighter and the center light seemed very normal in it&apos;s brightness.  I thought &quot;wow, that guy is coming in very low&quot;.  I followed the lights as they were coming toward me as I traveled east on PCH.  Then the lights shifted like one wing was turning completely over to the otherside, vice versa.  I thought the plane was trying to do an upside down manuver, therefore shifting ( I&apos;m doing my best to describe)  or doing a manuver that would have the lights flip over, like doing a barrel roll.  Right then the I could see that there were now the two bright lights were in front of the normal light. They were only 400 ft above and as the lights came to the leftside of my truck I could see two TEARDROP Black shaped crafts, with one extremely bright light on the very front of the vehicle.  I could not believe what I saw resembled the early versions of a UAV or a sleath teardrop craft, but it did make sense that these vehicles would be right there on PCH.  These vehicles were now inter-weaving with one another and boom they took off almost instantly!  Then came the private plane, probably a Cessna or Mooney.  This ws so off the wall, I could not explain it.  I told my family about the sighting but that was it. I know I never saw any stealth aircraft in the area, an! d have been next to one before.  This was not an F-117, but a formation of two teardrop shaped craft.  This was real for sure.  Please let me know if there were any sightings of these crafts in my area so I can know whats going on. Remember guys, I&apos;m not joking here.  This is not some student joke or a false report.  This was real and will stand behind everything I have said.", "09/04/94, Ewa Beach HI, Unidentified Spacecraft about 10 times larger and similar in design to our modern aircraft carriers.I am a military retiree. I Top Secret (Cosmic) and Nuclear (PRP) clearances when I was on active duty.I also had a two week interlude in Spain that occured when I was stationed in Rota, Cadiz, Spain that I will report when I am contacted and interviewed.  This experience I believe has led to the multitude of books that have emerged since 1975 because when I asked people not to report what I had seen, it appears that all of these individuals decided to go out and write their own books.The incident that I want to report was witnessed by Momi Leilani (fictious name) and I.  The object that Momi and I observed looked very similar to a U.S. USN aircraft carrier in color, and appearance, except about 10 times larger.  And this craft was clearly hovering above the horizon and was about 1/4 mile from me in distance.  I could see the sheets of metal squares that were welded and riveted to the hull of the spaceship.  I could clearly see the rivets that appeared to be about 10 inches in diameter.  The spaceship appeared almost instantaneaously and without any sound. It was airborne and about 10 degrees above the horizon.  Momi and I were seated on a picnic table about 50 feet from the beach. We were seated facing the beach.  I could see a rectangular port that was approximately 40 feet wide and 20 feet high taking into account the stature of the onboard Humans that I saw.  I could clearly see human people comprising of adults and children standing and observing us.  As soon as they realized that I could see them the spacecraft dissapeared ala Star Trek warp speed departure.  All we saw was the ship elongate and disapear towards Honolulu.  Again no sound and no wind movement.  The next day, when I went to work in Honolulu, the Radio Talk Show Personality by the Name of Larry Price reported that he had also observed the Space Craft and asked over the air live if anyone had witnessed the spacecraft to contact him at the radio station.  I did not call in because I was still not accepting what I had observed.  I tried to rationalize what I had seen and at first believed that maybe the U.S. must surely have some sort of super Top Secret space craft that I was not aware of, but later I could not rationalize why the people onboard appeared to be alarmed when they realized that I could see them.  This is when I had to accept that this spacecraft was not a U.S. aircraft.  This craft could easliy transport about 100,000 personnel.  The immediate impression in my mind was that the people new me and were observing us to see how we were doing.  Or could it be that they were just taking a sightseeing tour of the Hawaiian Islands?  When I was in the Navy I used to have to take polygraphs examinations in order to maintain my security clearances.  I used to have to take polygraphs from the various agencies.  There were circumstances when during the course of about 3 months I took polygraphs from the DIA, FBI, NIS, etc and ultimately interviewed by the CIA.  The polygraphs were always mainly having to do with National Security concerns.  It always alarmed me to have to take so many polygraphs, because it appeared like the intelligence agencies did not contact each other to confirm that I had already taken my required polygraph examinations.  It was like the agencies did not trust the results of the other agencies.", "definitly not aircraft but admitedly speed same as usual satellitesAs I enyoy watching satellites I look at the sky a lot.

Within about 30-seconds, the three stars were completely out of what I thought was a constellation and had traversed the sky to what appeared then to be a 45-degree angle from the horizon.

It was large and in the shape of a ring.  It had an inner ring as well.  The ring was made up of large circles.  It had the resemblence to a cell under a microscope (ie membrane with a nucleus)  It had no distiguishable color  It was hovering a few thousand feet above myself and my friend.  It was slowly rotating.  It was not lit at all.  Though it was night it could be seen because it was illuminated by the moon.  At first it seemed like it could be a formation of parachutists however it would be odd for parachutists to be jumping at night.  The object spun slowly for a few minutes and then proceded to move east quickly.  It wasn&apos;t too fast though, it moved about as fast as a plane from a long distance away.  At one point while hovering an airplane passed by it however the airplane was much higher in alititude.  It passed behind the object and was ecclipsed by it for a moment.  The observers are college students.", "Large white saucer-type aircraft spotted hovering in the late evening Phoenix sky  for several minutes &amp; then disappearedMy grown daughter and I saw one oblong saucer-like aircraft hovering in the sky.  It gave off a very bright white glow and appeared to have smaller white lights around the outer perimeter. It was distinctly NOT an airplane or blimp.  It appeared to turn sideways after a few moments which made the profile a slender oval in the sky and then it disappeared.  We both could not believe our eyes as we watched.  We both felt certain it was not an aircraft typical to our night skyline.", "While traveling from Anchorage to Seward, Alaska, a &quot;typical&quot; flying saucer whizzed directly over my Chevy Blazer coming from the other direction. I was only able to view it for a few seconds. It wasn&apos;t dark at 2:00AM because at that latitude it doesn&apos;t get dark in mid-June. Still, it was dusky and overcast so the true color of the craft was hard to determine. It appeared dull gray to me and there were no lights. Even though I had both windows down, I couldn&apos;t hear any sound coming from the craft. No engine noise whatsoever. I estimate its speed at roughly 400 mph and its elevation at around 1000 feet, possibly lower. The object wasn&apos;t huge, roughly 75 feet in diameter. Seward is south of Anchorage so the craft would have been heading north. I am coming forward with this now because Peter Davenport indicated on the rdaio that all sightings are relevant, no matter how dated.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "Silvery disc, far away, moving southI was letting my dog out (so many of these reports start like this...) I was looking at the sky and I saw the crescent moon, the north star bright and below and to the right (North) and then far to the left (South) was a bright blue star and then below and to the right of the blue star I saw a silvery dot. It moved from right to left but it kept dissappearing. I swear for almost a split second it looked like the classic ufo (disc with half a circle on top in middle) but it was really far away...Oh, also it was being chased by either a helicopter or plane (light flashing) but the disc did not emit any light", "This was in the summer of 1951 or 1952, not sure, went to Litchfield Park, Arizona every summer to visit a girl friend, and we went to Luke AirForce Base to go swimming, while we were out by the pool, looked up and saw this silver disc moving really fast and hovering over us, everyone there was looking up to the skyand then it disappeared. When I got home to California, told my Mother and she did not believe me. It was in the L.A. Examiner that a flying saucer was spotted at the base in Arizona. Then they believed that I saw something.", "Fire Island up close encounter with a UFO.It was the end of the summer season and the island was mostly vacated.  A friend and I were walking on the beach in an eastward direction.  He spotted a light coming from the northwest over the Great South Bay.  It was a moonless night.  He kept and eye on it as we strolled along, his hobby was identifying airplanes by their landing lights or sound of an engine.  As the object got closer it was easier to see.  It was low and slowly coming in our direction. It looked flat at first then came closer still so that we could see slightly under it. From beneath it we noticed a blue flashing light striking the water.  It ticked when it flashed.  It was going about 5 miles per hour and as it got to shore, over the forested reserve between the Pines and Water Island the blue light stopped.  We couldn&apos;t hear an engine...nothing.  It was moving towards us and I panicked running up a small dune and dune fensing to one of the homes where I saw a man watching tv.  I looked down at Ken and he wasn&apos;t following or responding so I went back down and yelled to follow.  He grabbed my wrist and pushed me into the dune as the craft moved overhead.  We huddled together in shock...at least I was.  It had a 90 degree, cone-shaped nose, a swept back wing and deep body.  I estimate it was 400 ft wide by 200 deep (nose to tail).  At that time I lived in a a 20-story building on Sutton Place, in Manhattan, so I used that scale to quess the dimensions and hieght of it.  It was approx. 20 stories overhead.  The back end was arced slightly into the body.  It was dark grey or black.  The color was hard to see, however the shape is burned in my mind since the starry sky defined it so clearly.  It continued to move and when it got to the southern (beach) shore of Fire Island it stopped.  No sound, no engine noise, no vibrations, moving at 5 MPH... it just stopped in mid air over the beach.  By this time we could see the rear of it and Ken said, &quot;Look at the pattern of lights.&quot;  There was a small red light in the middle rea! r and two white lights at eithther end.  They blinked red, red, rt. white, red, lft white then the white light moved across to the other white light across the rear.  Then we saw an amber light, like the ones on the helicopters that patrolled the east river sometimes.  I said, &quot;Thank God it must be the National Guard.&quot;  It got closer, but we heard no sound.  It was a round, glowing, amber light, the color of a glowing flame.  It was about 12 in diameter, I think.  The nose of the ship was still pointing southwest.  Suddenly the amber light collapsed.  It disappeared.  Then the large craft, on it&apos;s axis, pivoted pointing its&apos; nose due south.  It moved forward until it was over the ocean and the blue flashed started up agin.  We sat there watching it move towards the horizon flashing the blue light every 40 feet or so as if it was mapping or searching for something.  We walked back to our hosts house.  On the way I kept asking Ken what he had seen.  I wasn&apos;t sure if it had happened so I asked him if he had seen anything on the beach.  I was unhappy to hear that he had seen somthing.  I asked him to describe what he saw and to my dismay he did.  We went back to the house and told our friends. Of course, I was in shock and couldn&apos;t sleep that night.  I wanted to know what I&apos;d seen.  Ken slept all right.  When he got up I asked him how he got any sleep at all and he said that he&apos;d seen one before as a child on his parents woodlands in Ohio.  That wasn&apos;t what I wanted to hear. At that time I was Chief Operations Office for a large furniture company in Manhattan.  My friend was studying to be a personal trainer.  I&apos;ve always wanted to report the incident.  I&apos;ve told some close friends about it. I spent the next three months reading UFO literature.  I needed to define what I&apos;d seen.  My life chnaged.  NYC was no longer the center of the Universe.  Everything seem so insignificant. Thank you, ever so much, for the opportunity to share my experience.", "for 20 min. watched 2 sets of stationary equally spaced large round yellow lights, one string of 4, one of 5, blinked out in order.Upon returning from dinner to my friend&apos;s house high in the hills overlooking the city about 9:30 at night, she looked out her big glass deck door and said, &quot;Look at those lights in the sky&quot;. I said &quot;Oh, they&apos;re probably just in the hills&quot;.  She said &quot;No, the hills are way low on the horizon from here, those are very high in the sky&quot;. And indeed, they were.  There were 2 sets of very large round yellow lights.  The lights in each set were equally spaced apart and of the same size. They did not move. One had 5 lights and the other 4.  One set quite a bit below the other and staggered to the left of it.  We both went out on the deck to watch them for about 10 minutes.  Then she left to go inside and try to phone her son who was studying in Madrid, as this was the day of the terrorist bombing. I turned around to close the door behind her and the top set had disappeared by the time I turned back.  I continued to watch the remaining set and after about 6-8 minutes they started to blink out, going from right to left in order. First the extreme right , then a second or two later the next in line, then the last 3 turned sort of translucent, (see-throughy) and blinked out together. I don&apos;t know how long they had been visible before we saw them.  I didn&apos;t see anything on the news or in the paper about it, but knew that these lights were definitely not on the ground and not military.  They were rock steady.  Then a few weeks later with a group of friends in VA, I mentioned them and they said exactly the same phenomena was described in the new book &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; by a couple of Drs.  So I decided to contact you to report it.", "multiple contrailed objects falling together from the sky all turned at onceas i was traveling northbound on the 15 freeway, my wife noticed multiple objects, 4-6 of them in the clear blue sky with contrails moving slowly from the west to the east due north of our position. i explained to her the i thought it was a meteor that was breaking up in the atmosphere as it burned up. the contrails were long and flowing, but they dissapated awfully fast to be smoke and debris from a meteor. they faded more like mist. anyway, they continued moving slowly and as it appeared, randomly intertwining between each other as they fell. i thought it would be cool to get pictures. as i pulled over and got out, i noticed that all of them turned due north together and appeaered to be falling a t the same rate of speed, just away from us. i took three pictures and the objects faded into the distance. i was okay with the meteor idea right up until they all turned to the north. my wife thought that since there was gusty winds at the time that the wind had blown the falling debris to the north, but i explained to her that if it had been debris burning up from space, that the pieces were probably travelling at hundreds or thousands of miles per hour and the 40 mph gusts wouldn&apos;t affect them. not withstanding the fact that they were probably so high up in the atmosphere that the weather down here wouldn&apos;t even affect it or be close to the same for that matter. i got pictures! anyone else see the the objects?((NUFORC Note:  Possible flight of mil. aircraft??

The gentleman&apos;s wife was the first to spot the strange lights from an upstairs window. The lady called to her husband and when he got to the window she asked, &quot;what is that&quot;? The husband first thought it was an airplane a fair distance away from them but moving closer towards their direction. What started the couple thinking, was that whatever it was, moved along the horizon and eventfully passed from their line of sight due to a large pine tree which got in the way. Shortly after they lost sight of it, it came back into their view and again sat stationary. Six to seven minutes later the object still remaining stationary the two witnesses noticed two more smaller lights which appeared on either side of the larger light which they had already been observing. Seeing this was turning out to be really unusual the couple jumped into their car to see if they might be able to get a better look at the objects. They eventually reached a good location as to where they could watch the lights. They had pulled off the highway beside a farmers field and this is when they started taking the photos of the objects. The fellow told me at this point he is a bit of a skeptic when it comes to these matters, but after watching the strange lights in the sky he is re-thinking the whole topic on UFOs. Still observing the three lights, one of the smaller objects shot off away from the larger object at a incredible rate of speed. While still watching, another light which was sitting stationary, started to flicker out. Then all of a sudden in about 2 seconds it was in another location of the sky hovering. Another light appeared, taking the place of the light that just had flickered out. In total there were 5 to 6 lights sitting in the sky at one time. The fellow said it certainly was a formation of lights, one large one and all the rest were smaller in size. The large light was extremely bright and the other smaller ones were a lot dimmer. The couple were certainly baffled over what they were seeing. Thank you to the witnesses for the report. Sighting under investigation.

We started out earlier in the day in the Orange County area and we saw many airplanes and stars throughout the drive up.  When we got into the bay area, it was socked in and raining.  The clouds didn&apos;t let up and I would estimate that the ceiling was down to about 500 feet when we got to Windsor, CA.  We were looking for a motel to stop for the night when I noticed a dull reddish orange light off to the northwest.  (I would estimate the size of the light to be the size of my fingernail held at arms length.)  I asked my wife, &quot;what the heck is that?&quot;  She said, &quot;it&apos;s an airplane.&quot;  Then I said, &quot;that doesn&apos;t look like an airplane because it has no anti-collision &apos;strobe&apos; type lights on it.&quot;  I also said, &quot;who would be crazy enough to be up flying in rural northern california, at 3 in the morning, when the visibility was down to about 5-10 miles and the ceiling was about 500 feet?&quot;  That is a true statement because this area is dark as a hammer and it would be almost impossible to fly using dead reckoning at night, especially in extreme IFR conditions.  After coming to an almost complete stop on the highway, I decided to exit at the next offramp.  I did and when I stopped to look at the light, I noticed another car on the freeway that had slowed way down, to about 15 mph.  I wonder if they were seeing the same thing we were seeing.  That car kept on going and we were sitting there on the offramp at a dead stop so I rolled down the window to see if I could hear any aircraft noise.  We didn&apos;t hear anything.  At this point my wife said, &quot;you&apos;re right... that isn&apos;t an airplane.  What is that?&quot;  At this point the object was moving really slowly, but in an erratic motion where it was travelling sideways, but also in an upwards motion, then it would instantly change to a downward motion.  Definitely not how I have ever seen any airplane fly.  After about 10-15 seconds of this erratic flying, it moved in a straight! sideway s motion, at a high rate of speed, covering the distance of what I would estimate was about 300 yards and disappeared into the rain clouds.  At that point, the hair on the back of my neck was standing straight up.  My wife and I spent the next 10 minutes or so driving down the side road that parallels the freeway with our heads hanging out the window looking for the object.  We never saw it again.  Just thinking about this incident as I am sitting here typing this in is giving me goosebumps.  Whatever it was, it was really weird.  Never seen anything else like it. Let me try to explain what this thing looked like.  The best way I could describe this light is this:  You know when you see a jet on approach to an airport, but it is a long ways off, like 10-15 miles; you can see the landing lights on, and it looks like a reddish orange glow because of the smog and impurities in the air?  That is exactly what this thing looked like.  And that is what I thought it was right at first, but then it dawned on me... it couldn&apos;t be because of the low clouds and limited visibility.  That was when I realized that it had to be only a mile or so away from me and I realized I was looking at something else.  And it wasn&apos;t until I stopped the car that I could tell it wasn&apos;t flying straight and level and it was actually flying erratic.  The fact that there were no strobe type anti-collision lights on it really made me think this was something other than an aircraft. If anyone else reported anything similar to this, I would like to know.  If you need further clarification, feel free to contact me.  Thanks", "I was sitting on the patio in Point Loma (in San Diego, Ca) Friday, May 14th, 2004, looking up at the Big Dipper when I saw three red and blue flashing lights below it.  They came into my view as they rose above a parking structure, but were in the distance in the northwest.  They were rising straight up towards the sky at a fairly quick speed.  The lights were slighty larger than the stars in the sky.  Once it reached the &apos;handle&apos; of the Big Dipper (about 20 seconds) it seemed to have paused for a moment then headed southeast across the sky.  As it passed over me it was sioulletted by the moonlight and I noticed it had a triangular shape, but slighty rounded. It was about 1/8 the size of the moon and seemed to be quite a distance away.

The back side of the tri-craft was at least 50 feet across. The other two sides would measure similarly, I would estimate. There were six or seven pale yellow lights underneath. There was no particular uniformity about the position of the lights. The craft was no more than 100-125 feet above us. I yelled to my friend and driver to look up. Because of brisk traffic coming in both directions, he could not stop the car but he did manage to slow down and lean to the right in time to also get a brief glimpse of it.", "Morphing Chromatic Craft with ChaserIn the sky above our house on a clear day I spotted an object that was bright with chrome reflection. The object seemed to be about anywhere from 2000 to 5000 feet high. There where no clouds in the sky to guage height. There were no other aircraft in the sky to guage scale. My wife noticed it as well, and she agreed to keep an eye on it as I ran in the house and got my camera. I shot several images of the craft. In the max zoom of my telephoto lens (70 to 210) the object appeared to be a series of chrome spheres that seemed to be constantly moving and changing shape. Several times the objects formed a verticle &quot;V&quot; shape. The &quot;V&quot; shape was made twice in a very short time of say 3 seconds. I have photos of this, (as negatives as I haven&apos;t developed the images yet.) The group of orbs totaled 7 objects in all. They approached our house from the west and then began to travel south once they where over our house. Soon another sigular orb apeared from the north and started to follow the grouped orbs south. The group of orbs picked up speed slightly, and were soon covered from view by trees. Sight was lost on the sigular orb after the group moved south. The group continued to change shape the entire sighting. I reported this with the understanding that I may be reporting a few Mylar baloons that got loose from somewhere.

It looked like a string with an object connected at the end and it was rotating around the center the oval in the direction it was traveling. Almost as if it was the propelling force that caused the oval to move. Think of pedaling a bicycle.I observed it for about 10 seconds and looked back up in the sky and it was bright. Now being sure I could find it again I ran inside to get a witness. It was almost 6 AM and I pulled my sleeping son out of bed and aligned the object again in the telescope and his comment was &quot;what is that?&quot; I&apos;ve shown him may astronomy objects such as nebulas, star clusters, and most of the big planets so this was also new to his eyes also.Now 2 minutes at the most passed as I tried to get a camera up and running but no luck and the object was moving overhead so I looked again through the telescope and just at that point ... the oval blew up. The explosion looked like a firework that just went off in the sky.What was observed next was unexpected ... the tethered object in the middle separated intact and continued to rotate. So what I saw was an explosion the tethered object separate and the rotation continued (only now end over end instead of rotating around the oval). And now instead of moving overhead the tethered object is starting to move downward. (My hand tracking of the telescope now has me moving the telescope down instead of &gt; up and over as with the original path the oval was moving which was south to north.The tethered object now had 2 distinct ends one was the pivot end and the other was the original object that was rotating around the oval. So the rotation stayed the same but now moving downward as if falling from the sky and rotating around a new pivot.The new pivot point is now interesting as it now takes shape and color. It appears like an elongated cone, orange in color and it appears as if there are 2 &quot;strings&quot; coming from the &quot;cone&quot; to the tethered object rotating around this &quot;orange cone.&quot; The &quot;strings&quot; seem to come together as one, half way down the length of the tether.I watched this for about 1 to 2 minutes and even tried a higher power eyepiece but due to the narrow field of view of the higher power eyepiece I only saw it briefly and subsequently lost track of the tethered object. The orange color was more evident at the higher power and the 2 &quot;strings&quot; appeared more evident.The telescope used was a Meade 8&quot; Newtonian on an equatorial mount,ironically the mirror was just cleaned the day before so it was perfect and the only reason I was still out at 6 AM (the Sun was rising and ruining the star gazing) was the tracking motor was malfunctioning and I wanted to test the tracking on any bright object I could find before total Sun rise washed out even the brightest of stars and I would have to wait till night fall to test again.The weather condition was clear with good transparency (no haze)and the temperature was in the high 50 degrees F.", "I saw the lights in an arrow formation over San Francisco for 40 minutes and they didn&apos;t move an inch.Peter asked that we tell him about sightings that we&apos;ve seen at any time in our lives on Coast to Coast last Friday.

I was bored.  There, in the sky, and it looked to be over the southern part of San Francisco was a number (7?) of lights in an arrow formation.  One of the arrow pieces was missing.

As it passed over head and just in front of us we saw 3 white lights and one flashing light that made up this perfect triangle shape.  There was no noise and the craft glided across the sky.  The strange thing about it was you couldn&rsquo;t see the body of the craft like when an airplane flies by; it was as if you could see through it.  It flew off and accelerated towards the north, north east.  I&rsquo;m a pilot myself and can identify almost any civilian and military aircraft by shape and by sound.  I also know what kind of lights are required to be on an aircraft and where they are located.  So it takes something very out of the ordinary to get me to say hey look, that&rsquo;s not normal and this did just that.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information.

It had the standard looking orange flame surrounding a red/black core. I called my mom out to watch with me. Within five minutes the object had dulled to a soft glow (our sunset is about 20:15 here now but the object was still highly visible). The light then completley extinguished and the object seemed to turn more nothernly, toward the Olympic Mountains. As it fell, dark black smoke trailed behind it. It wasn&apos;t falling quickly, like a shooting star, but as a &quot;regular&quot; plane would fly. We are just across the water from SEA-TAC international, and there is no way this was a &quot;regular&quot; plane. Besides the initial &quot;fireball&apos;s&quot; brightness and length, the turn it made was less of a &quot;plane circle&quot; and more of a direct shift in angle. The news didn&apos;treport anything about the flame or smoke, and no one has gotten back to me yet about the reason behind this sighting. I do know that besides SEA-TAC, Vashon is about 60 miles north of Fort Lewis Army Base and McChord Airforce Base. I do not mean to insinuate anything with either of these establishments, just more to give the reader a location idea. This is our first sighting on Vashon. Both my mom and I had an unrelated sighting about eight years ago in the Bitterroot Valley. I do not consider myself to be near an expert in any of this, this sighting however left both of us a little chilled so we thought others may have seen it too..Thanks, enjoy your day!", "TRIANGULAR OBJECT MOVING AT A STEADY RATE OF SPEED WITH NO LIGHTS, NOISE &amp; COMPLETELY INVISIBLEIT WAS A VERY CALM, CLEAR EVENING.

I was in the tallest building in Santa Barbara, where the radio station was.  I was in the control booth.  I was looking out towards the ocean.  From where I was, you could see the bay and on either side were hills that come up.  Often times you see private plans flying or an occasional airliner descending to the airport further north.  What I saw this day was a very fast moving object that covered the distance between the two hill rises (on either sides of the bay) faster than any plane, or commercial jet could.  It was also lower in the horizon than planes flying in the vicinity. I asked the DJ, did you see that?  They had not.  I was then transfixed at the window.  I wanted to see it again.  Lo and behold, it came back the opposite direction about five minutes later. That&apos;s it.", "Triangle formation of moving stars, and slow bright object with in minutes of each otherI was out in my back yard having a quick smoke and taking a look at the sky.  As I looked south, about 60 degrees off the horizon.  I noticed a triangle formation of stars that looked interesting because I was looking that the geometric features of the constilations.  I noticed that something was not quite right about these stars because they were moving.  The stars kept shape as they moved acrossed the sky from the South to the North, and the color was of that of a standard star.  The speed was constant, and no odd movements were made by the three stars.  As I watched; there were no similarities to the star that would point out if they were high flying aircraft.  No blinking indicator lights, or contrails coming the passing object or objects.  I also took note that if they were satelites, it is almost impossible to see them in the city, not to mention in a formation as well.  With growing up in an aviation family, and have seen many aircraft at and from many altitudes, this was quite odd.  As several minutes had passed, by the time the object had come to about 60 degrees off the horizon, the star like lights disapeared.Not much after I as seen the strange formation of moving stars, I was standing outside try to call some friends to see if they had seen what I had.  Now standing in the front yard, looking to the North.  I noticed that something very bright was now moving acrossed the sky.  It was moving from West to East and was about 20 degrees from the horizon.  It traveled to slow to be a jet, and did not make any noise.  The object was so bright that it illuminated a small low flying cloud as it passed through it.  No sudden movements were made as it traveled from West to East.No other aircraft were flying that I could tell as well at the time.", "Possible Abduction (Ongoing)I was in the Air Force from 1982 till 1991.  My wife and I had tried to have kids the whole time while I was in the service but to no avail.  An Air Force physician had told us that we couldn&apos;t have any kids because my sperm count was too low.  I told him that I had suffered an injury ((deleted)) when I was a child.  He said that this was probably the reason why we couldn&apos;t have any children.One night in the summer of 1993 I had a nightmare and woke up the next morning in a cold sweat. For some reason I couldn&apos;t recall what I had dreamed and just shook it off.  I noticed a burn or boil ((deleted--in groin.))  A couple of days later I was mowing the grass and noticed three burn marks on the ground.  Each mark was circular and about 2 feet in diameter and blackened.I then noticed that the three circles formed a perfect triangle with about 30 foot sides. My wife can confirm this.  One of the circles was in close proximity to one of our blue spruce pine trees.  I thought that was peculiar so I grabbed my flashlight and squirmed underneath the tree.  On the trunk I found that the bark was burnt and a couple of small branches had been burned off. There was also some residue on the ground that resembled small chunks of yellow plastic.   This is not the end of the story. Next month my wife missed her period. We did a home pregnancy test and found out she was pregnant with my daughter **** (Born April 1994).  **** is extraordinary.  She gets straight A&apos;s and has some precognitive abilities.  A very sensitive child.It&apos;s as though whoever put the burn marks on my privates, fixed whatever damage there was from childhood. Last year **** came into our bedroom and asked to sleep with us because she was afraid. We said yes and the next morning she said that she woke up in the middle of the night,(she was laying between us), and said that four alien looking creatures were doing something to mommy and daddy.  &quot;Two on daddy&apos;s side and two on mommy&apos;s side.&quot;  She said that she got scared and put the blanket over her head and stayed that way till morning.  She did go on to say that they stepped through a door or portal and it had a bluish haze to it. It wasn&apos;t our bedroom door.  This makes me think that maybe the aliens are traveling through dimensions and not space. Anyway, you might think that I&apos;m totally wacko by now but I swear on a stack of bibles that this is the truth. I told my parents about the facts and they laughed at me, so that&apos;s why I dropped the subject.  Please, if you print this story I don&apos;t want my name publicized for obvious reasons.

Above it and to the upper left hand quadrant was a smaller one about the size of a nickle.I observed the object kind of floating with the wind which was moving from SW by W (I&apos;m A sailor and am very cognizant of wind direction and speed.) I commented that it looked like someone&apos;s balloon had gotten either loose or out of control.What made me think it was a balloon was the fact that it looked like a target, circular in shape with an orange center and a black perifory. This color combination changed from black out side to orange outside and as that happened the black moved to the center.I assumed I was looking at some sort of prismatic plastic balloon that changes colors as it changes angles to the light source.Then something happened that made me realize this was not a ballon at all, because it stopped and hovered for a bit then it began moving into what would have been the winds opposite direction. The smaller one did the same thing also. The two of them moved in a floating manner and there were no sudden or quick movements.At this time both the man I was talking to began to realize we were looking at something entirely new to both of us.However about two minutes into this sighting the large circle went up on it&apos;s side turning the target like image on end. It was at this point we realized we were looking at a disc.  There was no dome it seemed to be a flat disc with only a small thickness in proportion to it&apos;s size.  After about a minute more in this position it again went circular and turned once more to the side   Now we saw a glittering flash indicating that we were looking at something metallic.It flashed momentarily then went on it&apos;s side at this point the colored side would have been facing away from earth with the shiny side down.There was an instant when a blue green light best described as aquamarine in color emanated from the circular disk in a cone like manner,and completely around the disc, so much as we could discern form the angle we were looking at it. The light seemed to be widening as it shone down towads earth. This lasted for about two seconds.Meanwhile the two objects still close enough to be observed without having to look from one to the other, the small one went up on edge and we lost sight of it never agan to see it.After the larger one exhibithed the light phenomenon, we saw it return to it&apos;s original orange and black colors and still the colors seemed to bleed into one another and exchange places black inside orange outside and vice versa, kind of reminded us of a lava lamp.By this time we noticed another course change the large one still it&apos;s approximate original size began to change directions and again going with the wind began to move out over the ocean. We watched it turn from circle to flat and back to circle. all the time this object was not hurrying.We both agreed that we were watching something totally new to us, then without so much as a change in course the orange and black circular disc facing us back on the beach and still at this time the size of a quarter just absolutely and completely disappeard before our eyes.We tried to guess the height of the objects we were looking at,but since we had no way of knowing what size it was we couldn&apos;t accurately describe the height . There was no relative size to compare it with . However based on the size of one to the other and comparing the two we thought perhaps if one of the object s the larger one was at 3ooo feet the smaller one would have been perhaps 5ooo We could only guess.The sky that day was crystal clear not a cloud, or a mist or anykind of sight inhibiting thing that would have caused us an illusion of any sort.", "At exactly 10:00 p.m. me and some of my friends and neighbors have seen a coned shaped glowing object at the sky. As we looked through our binoculars, we observed that the flying object has differnt colors like red, blue, green, yellow and silver.  Three days before my uncle saw this flying object but he didn&apos;t bother to report it. They thought that it was only a star but it was different. It was not twinkling like a star. It only changes it&apos;s color every quarter of a second. We based it&apos;s movement from every other stars and it was faster and it moves to the east.  At 11:30 p.m., it was seen again at the south were it was seen at 10:00 p.m. I once red a book about this and the article said that most people that saw this U.F.O.&apos;s always says that they have never seen anything like this before and now I am one of them who is amazed to see this object and will always be watching the sky at night to report this object again if ever I see this again.", "My sons and I observed four bright, winking lights in the sky in a diagonal fashion in southern Arizona.I was returning with my two sons, ages 8 and 5, from Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument shortly after dark when I stopped for gas at Why, Arizona. Through my windshield while fueling I noticed an extremely bright, gold &quot;star&quot; at about 45 degrees to the slight northwest. I exclaimed &quot;Hello...&quot; and before I could point it out to my boys, it winked out. I am aware that the area to the north and west is the Barry Goldwater Air Force Range, so I attributed it to that. We then began on our way to Tucson east on AZ rt 86 through the Tohono O&apos;Odahm reservation. About 10 miles down the road from Why, my oldest son, riding in the passenger seat, excitedly exclaimed that he saw it, as did my youngest from the back seat. As I turned to look up and out the front right (south), I also caught just a glimpse before it again disappeared. This was a crystal clear desert night, so it was not obscured by clouds, nor was it by the mountains as it was again at about 45 degrees. They asked me if it was a ufo. I said yes, as it certainly was flying and unidentified, either ours or &quot;Theirs&quot;. To tickle their fancy, you know.It gets better. A moment later, there now appeared four bright gold &quot;stars&quot; on a 45 degree diagonal, top right, bottom left, and equally spaced, at the same position. The angle of my view made it difficult for me to see them without leaning forward. I was now rather nervous and wished only to get back to the city lights, so I continued without stopping. My son then informed me that the objects began to &quot;wink out&quot; one by one. This action repeated itself two more times, with me viewing only sporadicly.

In addition to this object, she noticed a &quot;string of flashing lights&quot; at the same apparent altitude as the big round object, extending in a line eastward. She sensed that these lights were somehow associated with the object. She&apos;s unsure of their number, but that there were multiple flashing, separate lights. They were about the same size as streetlights and were yellowish in color.

On the way back I was in the passenger seat, and happened to look at this bright low star, or so I thought. It caught my eye, because it was so bright, yet so low. Never thought anymore about it. We made it to the resturant, then headed back home. Now my husband, was driving, and he said wow what is that, here he noticed the light, because it was now on his side of the road. I told him I noticed it on the way back to the resturant. We pulled off the road, in a spot where we saw radio towers, just to compare it. It was as high as the towers, brighter then the towers, and the sky was clear, with a full moon. The towers had to be about five miles from us, and we could see the frame of the towers, but no frame on the bright light. The light slowly moved to the other side of the towers, and it grew lighter then darker, in brightness. So we assumed it was a plane. We got back on the road, and continued on, but pulled off the road again,because it had moved now behind us. At that point we called our son in Columbia Station, Ohio. He went outside, and could see it also, and this was 80 + miles away. We told him to get his camera, and get a picture. Then we called my sister-in-law, in Elyria, Ohio, she went outside with my niece, with binoculars, the saw it, and said it had lights like a blooming flower, with rays off of it, and it twisted and turned.

We called Channel 5 news in Cleveland, Ohio, to see if there were any reports. No one belived us.

I then noticed quite a bit higher than this object was a small black dot, moving at exactly the same rate of speed as the reddish object, as though they were attached. My initial thought was a ballon or kite, but these objects were way higher than the the airplane. I ran inside to get my digital camera.

The object continued to move at a very slow pace until it was almost directly overhead, when my brother returned from a trip to the store. He immediately saw the objects as well. I gave him my camera nad told him to keep taking pictures while I went to get my video camera. When I came back, inoticed three or four of my neighbors also pointing and looking at the object. I tried to find the object in my camera viewfinder, but it did not show up. I took footage anyway. The object continued on a straight line, seemed to be gaining in altitude, until it went out of site.

This was HUGE, many times over the size of a jet or airplane..  It had what looked like black smoke oulining it, with nothing inside.  What it looked like ,was a UFO type craft, but with the black outlining only. I ran outside with my binoculars to look, though I could see it very plain without them.  I had no camera to take a picture!  I was trying to get a better veiw of two objects that looked to be parachutes just below the circular &quot;smoke&quot;ring.  The two  objects below the &quot;ring&quot; looked like something was attached.  I ran over to an RV to my left and behind me, to tell them.   At that time, it was still quite visible.  I was wondering, had a plane blew up???  Had someone parachuted out?  But the huge outline, amazed me, as it was in the pattern of a craft, much larger than that a plane, many times!So I told the RV  people who had recently pulled nearby me. They had been drinking, (I had not) they laughed, and asked had I been to Roswell?  They did not seem concerned nor wanting to even look, so I left. Back at my RV, I looked again, just a bit of &quot;smoke&quot;remained.  From the RV to my right came a woman to see what I was looking at.  She saw some of the remaining &quot;smoke&quot; or outline of the ring.  It had been in the sky some time, about ten minutes approx.

City, N.C. when the Duty Radioman called me with a report of UFO.One craft, approx 30&apos; LOA, glowing white with two yellow port holes and a flashing green light below. The voice I heard in the Control Tower identified himself as a USMC Captain, the Duty Officer. He said there were four or five other observors in the tower with him. At one later point the object departed (tracked by Washington FAA Center) and proceeded down the Potomac River (north bound), climbed to an alt of approx 1000&apos; AGL and speed of about 100 kts. It was tracked by the Center to a position directly over the White House where observers saw it turn upward at a high angle of attack and flash out of sight. The object was later reported (according to Washington Center) by a NW airlines B-727 at FL330 NE of WashDC enroute NYC. It tracked the airliner for a few seconds then turned and flashed out of sight.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I noticed a yellow search light or clearance light rotating on what I assumed was on the top of a tractor on a not to distance hill between me and the lake.  There are two hills creating a spill way or overflow for the lake.  In the dark I could not figure out if it was on the close hill (1/8th of a mile) or the far hill (1/4th of a mile).  The object seemed to glide up the hill and sit there for 40 seconds and then go back down the hill.  I was in complete amazement as to why a tractor with no headlights and only a yellow revolving light on top would be out on restricted government land closed to gas vehicles.  I then noticed no sounds, not even country noises from bugs and related night noises.  As the object went behind the hill again I realized I was seeing the bottom of something as the yellow revolving lights were on the grass and trees without a shadow of the object.  This realization made me want the safety of my home and bed (I am 47 but the little boy inside me was not going to make the walk to the lake in the dark and figure it out).    In my mind I now know I saw something off the ground as the area is too steep with trees for a land vehicle; also the lights were below the object.  The object glowed bright yellow from the bottom.  One revolving light did a 360 degree turn every second or so and appeared to be scanning the ground for something.  The spillway is rather long and isolated from the half dozen or so houses near by.  It could be used as a landing strip for a small plane.  Very wide and flat and a half mile long .  I heard nothing and have heard or seen nothing since. The next day I asked the neighbor if he heard or saw anything the night before, but he did not.((name deleted))((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))update:  I just filed a report.  Then I went to your tab saying enter site.  I was interested to see a report listed from a air traffic controller stating an aircraft spotted two or four ufo&apos;s outside Omaha going west at 1900 hours on Thursday March 25th.  That could fit my timeline on what I saw.  I said Thursday, rather it was early Friday morning at 3:30. I also got the impression that I saw the object and the object saw me.

I can be sure of the time because the news had just started on the television and it was time to let my Irish setter outside to do his job. One thing I want to point out here, is that my wife and I live just south of South Bend, Indiana city limits and We have a completely unabstructed veiw of the horrizon to the south. I had no sooner hooked the dog chain up, when my Irish Setter lunged out the door and started barking up in the air at an object flying over our backyard and off into the distance. I stood tranfixed on the sight.  The object was a bright orange-red color like somthing on fire but with no actual flames or tail coming from it. It appeared to be a sphirical shape. It made no sound at all. The object was not falling to the ground, but rather on a level flight path. The night ski was pretty much clear that night. Judging the size would be to much of a guess but if I were being pressed, I would say that it had to be nearly 150 feet or more in diamiter and seemed to be traveling at a very high speed. The object took a direct path due south. I stood outside on my back porch and watched the object until I could no longer see it beyond the horizon. The whole episode took maybe 15 seconds. I see airplanes and gliders and such all the time out my backyard view and I can tell you that this was non of these. I am a well known Business owner in the community and well respected. I am a Buddhist LAma, I have several Degrees and am not prone to flights of fancy. If the truth be known, I would have just forgot about this, but after seeing other reports a few weeks later in the same area, I thought that this should be reported to someone. (I would like to add, that 25 years ago while driving south toward Odessa texas, I and at least 5 other drivers saw this EXACT SAME OBJECT FLY OVER US. aT LEAST FIVE OTHER CARS AND TRUCTS ALL PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND GOT OUT TO ASK IF WE HAD ALL JUST SEEN THAT OBJECT.

We watched it untill it was out of sight.  As I turned to go back in my home I heard my father yell &quot;What the hell is that!&quot;  I Quickly looked up in time to see a large cigar or rectangle shaped object zip across the sky.  It was very dark in color but you could still see dim reflections through out the whole object.It had what appeared to be four dimond shaped lights,just slightly smaller than the whole object, across the bottom; however they were also very dim. The whole object looked sort of faded as it went over head. When I looked up the object was directly above my house and considerably low flying, aproxametly 10,000 feet or so. My father, who is learning to be a pilot, said that the object was flying about even with the top of the mountains.  As I looked up at the object it continued to fly forward in a straight line although it appeared to be sitting at an angle with one side higher in elevation than the other. It was flying from south to north on the west side of the big dipper and directly in between to very bright stars that I think may have been planets.(astronomy is not my strong point.) It crossed a considerable amount of sky very fast, about 4 to 6 seconds, and then was temporarinly out of sight. What struck me as the most odd part about this first pass, other than the shear speed of the object, was the fact that there was no sound. No soud at all, dead silent. A few seconds later the object was vissible again, only a lot higher in elevation, about cruising elevation for an average jetliner.  It continued north for about 4 seconds then quikly shot back south. It covered about 2 inches of the sky in only 2 seconds then just dissapeard.  My father and I stayed out side for about another 5 minutes wathcing the sky, more so out of shock than anything else.  At one point we saw a jetliner in the sky tr! aveling from east to west. One thing we noted was that for the jet to travle about a 2 inch distance of sky took nearly 15 to 20 seconds as aposed to the 2 seconds of the earlier object. Also the satalite we had been watching was traveling south east, and the UFO started about where the satelite had gone out of sight.Another erie fact to mention would be, that after the object passed I had gone in my 93 ford ranger to grab my jacket and upon entering every light in my truck began flashing. The headlights, the taillights, the domelight, and the blinkers, were all going nuts for about 15 seconds.", "Blue-green fireballTraveling north out of Savannah, I&apos;m not sure what road it was, we were heading home after spending the day in the old section of town. My 23 year old daughter and I. I&apos;m a machinist, and she is a veterinary assistant. Anyway, we had stopped to get gas, and had pulled out of the station, looking for road signs to get on the interstate, when we saw a huge streak of light traveling from (at best guess)NW to SE. It actually caught our attention because of it&apos;s color, it was a beautiful greenish blue, and like I said, BIG. It was moving very fast, it didn&apos;t seem at the time to be very high up in the sky. In fact we slowed down and looked over to see if it had crashed in the wooded area to our right. A few months later I was talking to a co-worker and I mentioned it to him, and oddly enough, he had been out in his boat on Lake Greenwood at the time, and he had seen it too. Lake Greenwood is 160 or so miles from Savannah, so what we saw was either a really big UFO or an amazing meteor! I&apos;ve watched meteor showers before, and none of the ones I&apos;ve seen can compare. To give you an idea of it&apos;s size, I&apos;d say that a dime held out at arm&apos;s length would be about right.", "Unexplained light in the sky over Heiskell.At ten o&apos;clock, just as Frasier went off the air, it began to rain very hard outside. I went to the front door, which faces northwest, and looked out. Through the trees, slightly towards the west, where I usually see Venus in the evenings, I saw a bright, yellowish light flickering through the tree branches. I watched for a few seconds trying to determine if it might just be Venus I was seeing and realized that this was something different. I stepped out onto the front porch to get a better look. I had to crouch down to get a view of it without the obstruction of the tree branches. As I watched, the light grew in size and brightness and changed to a ruddy color. (At its largest, it was twice the size of Venus). It then began to drop what looked like blobs of red light toward the ground. It did this for about ten seconds at which time its intensity dwindled down to a pinpoint and the color back towards yellow. After a few seconds it became very bright and red and again rained down several large blobs of red. Another couple of minutes and it winked out completely. The only sounds I heard were from a jet flying over in another part of the sky. As a veteran of the Army, I&apos;ve been on night laneuvers where flares were employed to light a battle area. With a flare there is always a crackling sound and smoke while it is deployed. There was neither smoke nor sound with this sighting. Nor was there any excess illumination caused by its presence. I&apos;ve never seen a flare grown small then large again the way this thing did. A report from anyone else who saw this or a possible explanation would be welcome.

Me and my 5 yr. old niece were playing on the trampoline waiting for the sun to go down, so we can star gaze. I went to show my niece one of the stars we could already see and when we both looked up there was a yellow light flying over head. The speed was great. It was gone within seconds. It was like fire yellow.  It actually looked like fire shooting across the sky. I live close to an Dobbins Air Force Base and Lockheed. I may have just been seeing the tale of a jet hitting mach speed. But normally I can hear the jets as they go buy, but no sound was coming from this. I see alot of things in the sky around here.

It was about 9pm, in the fall, September.  I was pacing back and forth next to the sidewalk, speaking with my girlfriend, who was sitting on the curb.  As I turned and faced north, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a light in the sky.  I turned and faced it and pointed at it and said &quot;Look!&quot;.  My girlfriend jumped up and we both watched it for about 10 seconds.  Then I ran to the front door of my home and yelled at my family to come see.  They were slow to respond.  By the time I went back to my original position to look at it, it was gone.  My girlfriend said it went over the small mountains to the south east. Its appearance - flawlessly circular, burnt orange, constant hue with small mechanical like random pulsations of equal size on its surface.  Moving slowly in a straight line, silent!   Size difficult to determine, because of it&apos;s circular shape, and dark blue background of the clear night sky.  My best estimate - between 40 to 200feet dia, approx. altitude of 400 to 1000ft, approx. speed  40-50 mph. Direction - north north east to south south west.  About 10 degrees off of horizontal, decline. The most striking characteristic of this object was:  silent operation.  No sound whatever.  Also, the appearance of the random pulsations against the burnt orange surface.  And it&apos;s apparent size in the sky.  About 20% larger than a full moon.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

( about 1979 July or August) My Dad and I had stopped to speak to an old friend. I was looking towards the west in the direction of the town of Hamilton. The evening was warm and overcast. I have tried to show this in the attached drawing. When I saw the first object, it was emerging from behind the hills to the west, which are about 8 or 10 miles away. Within a few seconds the first object was totally visible, then the smaller object rose up from behind the hill and was soon totally visible also. The objects were both orange in colour and seemed to shimmer with long flowing tendrils. The second object was about half the size of the first. I am a lousy artist but the objects in the drawing are very close to the things I saw. The perspective in the drawing is about correct, so you can imagine the size of the objects from 8 or 10 miles away. My Dad and his old pal were deep in conversation. When I told them to look at the fireballs floating up through the clouds they didn&apos;t seem to be able to see them. My Dad seemed to be agitated with me for disturbing his conversation and they continued to talk as if nothing had happened. I know that this was no hallucination. The objects merged together before floating up into the dark clouds. My Dad never had any time for this sort of thing (UFOS) so I never spoke to him about it. The whole thing from start to finish took about 2 minutes at the most. I am now 45 years old and this scene has been in my mind since the night I saw it. I will send you some more info on some more odd sightings I have had if you want. I do a little amateur astronomy and watch the satellites often with the naked eye, but when one stops and stays there for 2 or three minuets, brightens up like a flare then zooms off in the opposite direction, it makes you think. I know the Sun can catch satellites and make them brighten to about the brightness of Venus at the moment, but I have never seen one brighten as much as this and then shoot off in another direction.

I was 16 and headed home from school across the back field when i noticed something wierd up in the sky. I had a good view of everything from the school to the North Shore Mountains and have always had good eyesight, but couldn&apos;t really fathom what was hanging there... maybe people will laugh but it was a perfectly hatbox-shaped, very minty green cloud, about a mile away and hovering over the city about 2 miles up. It was also huge, covering about 2 miles with it&apos;s shadow with a height of about a mile. The thing looked like some kind of oval hatbox, hanging up there in the sky. And it didn&apos;t move. It had a puffy surface texture that clearly showed an effect of wind, sort of like a knife moving icing, for want of a better description... but the cloud itself looked solid and didn&apos;t move, although a couple of smaller and more normal-looking clouds in the sky were moving along at quite a fast clip.

Additional Information Below:  We live 6 miles north of Rupert, Idaho (50 miles east of Twin Falls, Idaho, southern Idaho USA)  First looked at it through binoculars at about 10:00 p.m.. It was sometime in about 1999. The only way I can describe &quot;smudge&quot; is that it looked like a elongated very small chalk line in the sky....not round like a star. The first computer drawing shows both objects. The right group disappeared behind clouds before I got out with the binoculars. They were like a cluster of white round grapes surrounded by a wisp of fog when I first saw them through the binoculars. Fog was white like a thin cloudy material. The object was about an inch at arms length with unaided eye. The computer drawings show about the amount of small round moon-like objects....can&apos;t remember counting them but there were many of them...some larger than others. They didn&apos;t move in any way except to very slowly gather into one moon-like object. My husband and I were the only witnesses on our farm. Didn&apos;t hear of any other witnesses. Weather conditions: clear dark skies and a little cool. No aircraft seen or heard....no sound. No beams of light coming from them and no tails or trails. Drawings made by witness.

It was a pretty clear night, and often if I am outside and the sky is clear, I will look up at the stars for long periods of time.Well, I looked up while I was taking my bookbag out of my car, and I saw that SOMETHING up there was moving because I could see that motion of stars disappearing and reappearing.  It was larger than a normal plane probably because it flew closer to the ground, I would say about helicopter level.  As it flew northeast from southwest, it flew above my head.  I noticed it was going at a medium pace, and that it was triangle shaped, but also had an indentation at it&apos;s base, like a boomerang.  I was stunned because I noticed that craft had no lights whatsoever!!! I had thought that all aircraft were required to have lights!!  I tilted my ear up to the air to listen for sound but there was none.  The bottom of the craft (on the bottom corners) seemed to have a faded dark grey circle.  I could tell it was lighter than the black craft, but I can&apos;t say it was light because it was so dark! If I hadn&apos;t looked up to see the stars move and realize there was an object I would of never known it was there...completely silent and dark.  It never hesistated, it just flew over me in the course I indicated earlier.  As it flew more Northeast, I tried to spot it, but I could not longer see it.This is my very first unidentified aircraft sighting, even though I have been looking for a very long time!!  I was pretty excited, but not scared.But...when I woke up the next day I realized I felt sick.  I developed a cold.  I don&apos;t know if the craft had anything to do with it, but I am getting better now.  I went on the internet to see what I could find about crafts.  Believe me, I was SHOCKED to find out many people have had experiences with black triangles and no sounds!! In all my years of UFO interest, I had never really stumbled upon the black triangle phenomena! Thanks for reading my sighting!", "i have no idea what this object can be at is this a UFO?????While i was going to my room i happen to look out the window only two see one bright red orange looking type of light in the sky that seems to be very high in the sky. i thought it was some type of aircraft but the object seem to have no movment once so ever. i then took out my telescope to get a better look and along with my camra which i used to take pic&apos;s of the lights in the sky. when i looke at the lights they were not any type of aircraft that i would know about they did not have any blue or red light that will tell you it&apos;s a airplane. as i look closer i see one light fade away in the darkness and then a secound later another light appers in the skiy next to the first light i saw few minutes later the two lights fade away i say for about four minutes. later all three lights apper once agin one by one. they apperd in the same spot i first saw them and didn&apos;t seem to move at all. i stayed up and saw these process happen over and over for about an hour or so. after an hour all three lights in the sky fade away one by one.", "On 4-16-2004 I saw a huge sphere shaped object that had six lights in the sky over Logansport and it remained for several seconds.We were going down 24 west toward Lake Cicott, Indiana when out the window I saw lights glowing we pulled over so we would not wreck.  Several people in front of us put on their brake lights as well.  There in front of us was 6 glowing lights looked like amber fire balls.  It hovered for several seconds to maybe a minute and during this time the lights flashed on and off a couple of times.  When I realized what was happening I called the radio station with no reply than I called the Sherriffs department and they informed me they had several different calls.  As I was talking to them explaining what I had seen I saw lights again this time further away from me and I told them what I was seeing.  It looked like they were being chased or something.  When we called in regards to this matter today 4-17-2004, they have now stated it was the military practicing war games.  I do not beleive this because I know what I saw.", "This event took place in early fall around 1949-50. It occurred after a Boy Scout meeting in the Baptist Church. The Baptist Church sits on a knoll with the parking lot below. The Church is a square building that rises about 100 feet above the floor of the parking lot and faces due South.  There is a sidewalk in the middle of the parking lot that leads up a broad set of stairs to the front of the Church.In Texas in the early Fall the days can be warm and then it cools down pretty good in the evening. After the Scout meeting my friends and I went outside and laid down of the sidewalk looking up into the clear star filled sky.  Since the sidewalk holds its heat it provided warmth and permitted us to talk, look at the sky and be warm at the same time.  We were talking about the sky and the stars and then one of us noticed a V formation moving from the top of the Church due South.  There was no sound and our immediate reaction was that it was geese flying south for the winter.  The formations kept coming  at irregular intervals when suddenly one of us realized that the formation was moving across the sky at a rather fast pace and for it to be geese we would have heard them honking if they were low enough to be picking up the lights from the city.  San Marcos in the late forties was a sleeply little college town and we didn&apos;t have a lot of city lights in those days.  The Baptist Church was about two blocks from the city center.  Another observation was that if they were high enough for us not to hear them then they were moving at a tremendous speed because they were clearing the sky from the Church front to the horizon in about 10-15 seconds.  We had some pretty smart boys in that group who grew up to be doctors and lawyers, and scientist and we quickly concluded that what we were seeing was not geese, ducks, or airplanes.  We had seen plenty of airplanes with the airbase in town and with the big bases in San Antonio.  These were not airplanes.  The formations were usually v shaped and sometimes there would be an outrider apart from the formation.  They would enter our field of view from different tracks always coming from ourhead over the Church heading due south.  Puzzled by the whole thing we went across the street from the Church and knocked on Mr ((name #1 deleted)) door and asked him to come out and see what he thought.  Mr. ((name #1 deleted)) owned a grocery store in the neighborhood and we all knew him.  He agreed to walk across the street and take a look. As usually happens the formations seemed to stop.  Just as Mr. ((name #1 deleted)) started to leave a formation came over and we pointed it out.  He studied it and another one that came over and then exclaimed - &quot; I think those are what they call Cosmic Rays&quot;.  We really didn&apos;t know much about cosmic rays and since the objects were luminous the &quot;ray&quot; idea seem plausible so we just said --Oh.  We went back and casually watched the formations for a while and when they started to become less frequent we all went home.Years later when we were much wiser we realized that what we saw that night was not cosmic rays. The ojects as I remember them were cylindrical and luminous.  There was no blinking and the objects maintained even spacing and did not wander around like geese and ducks in formation. The light seemed to be reflected but since there really wasn&apos;t that much light to cast a reflection it is hard to say where the light was coming from.  If they were low enough to pick up the lights of the town then the objects must have been very small and would give the appearance of geese/ducks in size at the lower altitude.  Since there was absolutely no sound and the formation did not act like birds, my memory want to say that they were probably larger objects at a much higher altitude and were emitting their own light. Whatever altitude they were at they were moving very fast, even by todays standards of flight.  To be at high altitude and move as fast as they were in clearing the night sky from Church to horizon would put them in the SR-71 catagory and we never had too many of those during their era. I don&apos;t even think an SR-71 going flat out at altitude could have cleared the sky as fast as these objects.I am a retired Air Force General Officer.  I am not a pilot but I have been around airplanes and high tech all my life and I cannot account for what we saw on that cool fall night in Texas.  I would say that the IQ level in the group of boys there that night was in the top five percent and as I said earlier they all grew up to be very accomplished professionals.  We were young but we weren&apos;t stupid.I happened to hear Peter Davenport on the radio talking about not getting enough reports especially from the late forties and early fifties and decided to make my contribution.  I would be interested in knowing what you folks make of it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It looked just like a bright yellowish white star at first glance, however, i ruled this out when i noticed it was moving at different speeds.  First, it seemed as if it wasnt moving, or hovering, but then it moved suddenly to another part of the sky and hovered again.  It was very high and very very bright.   Its brightness was another thing that made me believe it wasnt a star.  I noticed that it was brighter than even the brightest of planets, however, it flickered red and blue.  It also emitted these red and blue lights away from the UFO, but these emitted lights were not as large and less intense.  After close to 30 mins the UFO had my field of view.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of a celestial body, possibly Venus or Sirius.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was cool but not cold, and the air and sky were crystal clear.There was little light pollution as there were hardly any street lights and little to no noise to speak of. We were just hanging out and talking when I looked up and saw three lights in a triangle shape moving quietly across the sky against a starry night sky.  It was about the same height as jets fly and I told my friend to look up and they also saw it. All I could see were the lights and they were slowly spining in a circle while moving across the sky at about the same speed as a jet would fly. Stars would dissapear as this craft would pass between me and the stars and then reappear. I was too young to pay too close attention,so I am not sure of the size, but I was aware that this was something out of the ordinary and mentioned to my friend that it was a ufo. We watched it it till it moved out of sight.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

One at each end, but they weren&apos;t on though, I thought after if they were on they might have blinded everybody on the road booth ways.

At 12:00PM, I took a lunch break.  While I was taking my lunch break under a shade, I was admiring the beach direction view of this condo location.  I was wearing polarizing sunglasses at the time.  I noticed a helicopter flying around in the air.  It was a small helicopter like those of a small Huey or traffic watcher type.  It kept slowly flying around in the general area inside the bay/gulf channel near the bridge on the fishing side.  It would occasionally descend in each pass where people fished then ascend back to its slow, flight pattern of just wandering around near the bridge area.  My first thoughts of this odd flying behavior was a news helicopter trying to make some news because of the recent bonanza of whitings congregating at the fishing site. To the left of the bridge are two condos located on the bay side which I think are still under construction, and the height of those buildings I think is twelve floors.  On the Gulf side of those condos is undeveloped land and the beach.  From the bridge to my location, I think the distant is about one mile.  From the bridge to the two condos, I think the distant is about one-eight of a mile.  From the condos to my location, I think the distant is about one mile.  The sky was partly cloudy, and the temperature was about 80 degree F. While I was watching this helicopter flying around, I noticed what appeared at first to be a large balloon drifting in the wind.  The size of the balloon object is about the same size of the condo&apos;s window from my viewing location.  Its path when first seen originated by the bridge and possibly out in the Gulf near the beach.  The balloon object altitude was above the two condos, and the balloon object altitude was at least 1 and a half condo high from my perceptiveness. The balloon object had no colors except for a minute grayish color that reflected no sunlight similar to the color of a water droplet. The balloon object was perfectly round.  As this balloon object moving from west to east drifted pass the two condos starting from the bridge in an estimated time of about 30 seconds to a minute; the balloon object completely stopped drifting and almost seem to hover in the same position for about 15 seconds.  Then the shape of the balloon object changed to something not roundish.  Its color also changed to something like a black dot but still not roundish in shape.  Then this object travel back towards the bridge location at same speed of 30 seconds to a minute.  Then it stopped and reverse coarse towards the two condos.  It appeared to get slightly smaller.  Then about half way towards the condo, I saw for a brief moment a color of paper white appear for about 3 seconds, and it was definitely not a sunlight reflection.  I realized that this was no balloon, so I was trying to figure out what it could be.  After the fourth back-and-fourth trip of this object, an advertising plane appeared trailing its advertisement.  The object on its way back towards the two condos seem to disappear from view behind the two condos.  I was waiting for it to reappear on the left side of the two condos which it did not reappear. On the right side of the bridge are some condos.  I notice a bright red/orange parachute probably being pulled by a boat.  The distant to those condos is about a mile.  The size of that parachute ! from my location was about the size of a quarter if I was to held it up in front of me.  When comparing the size of the object to the parachute, the object was like a pea to the parachute.  Then the object that disappeared behind the two condo reappeared from the right side of the two condos.  I thought to myself, &quot;I wonder if the helicopter pilot is seeing what I am seeing?  Surely if there was something out of ordinary, he would investigate it.&quot;  I was thinking, &quot;Gee!  If only I could talk to the helicopter pilot and ask him to investigate what I was seeing, then he can tell me what he saw.&quot;  I took off my sunglass to see if I could still see the object without the aid of the sunglass, and I was still able to see the object, but not as good, so I put the sunglass back on me.  I kept watching this object going back-and-fourth between the bridge and the two condos when I noticed a white dot way out near the horizon in the Gulf.  It was probably about 5 to 10 degrees above the horizon, and intermittently it was hidden by the clouds.  It didn&apos;t look like it was shining a light, but it did appeared to be just a paper white dot.  It is possible that it could be a jet coming towards my direction, but that object defiantly did not pass over my location to get to the spotted location unless it was flying way up high if it did pass location. All of this viewing took place during my 30 minutes lunch break.  When I went back to work, I was still able to see the object, and I explain to one of my co-workers what I saw during my lunch break.  I pointed in the direction of the object and my co-worker was able to see it too.  He seem like it was nothing since he just glanced at for a few seconds, but I find it strange that all this object did was go back-and-fourth during my lunch break.  If it was one of those parachute rides pulled by a boat, it would had to been at least 2- 4 miles out in the Gulf.  Another possibility of what the object may had been was another helicopter, but when I first saw this object, it was perfectl! y round and drifting almost like a balloon.  When I first seen the object, it may had been up closer, but possibly it may had zig-zag a coarse out into the Gulf becoming smaller as it went which may explain how the two condos were able to make it disappear for a brief moment.  It may be nothing, but I saw it, and I can&apos;t explain it, so I&apos;m reporting it.", "Sphere  shaped object  hovering low in skyThe  object was hovering in  one place when I noticed it, about  500 feet above ground , shaped like a saucer and size was about 100 feet long maybe bigger, completely silent.In back of my house is a dry wash and beyond that are a few houses  then the mountains... the UFO  seemed to be above the  houses.  It was there when I first noticed it. and after talking to my friend about it who was with me  we ran home so I don&apos;t know how it took off or where.

The jet was at cruising altitude and heading from the SE to the NW.    The sphere was heading from the SW to the NE.  It looked like it was several thousand feet below the airliner and travelling at about the same speed.  The jet was leaving a short contrail, but the sphere was not.  I continued to observe the sphere until it disappeared into the distance.", "Object was flashing orange/white lights and moving in circles very slowly and vanishedI was looking outside of my bedroom window waiting for the cab to arrive. As I waited I looked up into the sky and seconds later there was like a circle-shaped object in the sky flashing red/orange and white lights. I watched it for a few minutes longer and it seemed to move from right to left and then back again. After about 6 minutes or so, the lights faded into the sky and disappeared.", "A circular shaped craft  emiting three amber rays under it slowly hovering silently over the houses of the neighborhood .I perceived it first as 3 beam of amber lights coming from the north over the hills towards me coming down at a 45 degree angle. I was on the side of the hill which is filled with houses all the way to the top and around. Before the craft came howering over the houses I called my family who were in my sister-in-law&apos;s home; by the time they all gathered to see, the craft had dipped a little below the houses in top of the hill (who is aproximately 500 ft. high). The craft made a turn at a very slow speed and went towards the left (west) parrallel to the hill. My wife, sister-in-law, and my two kids saw it perfectly well in front of us at a height of about 300 ft. It didn&apos;t make any noise, and I perfectly saw the three rays of lignts on the bottom of the craft inside this round hole on the center of the bottom. The craft looked identical to saucers that have been drawn or fotografed before.  It was night but we could clearly see its dome shape siluate and bottom because of the light of the city.My kids noticed many blue colored windows. There were neighbors on the other side of the street in front who were talking together in a circle who didn&apos;t noticed it even though it went by very slowly until it disapeared behind the same hill over the houses not far from our house. Many sightings were seen by many people even during the day months around this time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was pretty high, so it looked small, but it wasn&apos;t high enough to be a satellite.

Everyone left to go home except my friend from next door and myself. We were sitting on the sidewalk in between our homes talking when we both saw movement above our heads and looked up. The triangular shaped object, about 18-20&apos; long seemed to be following the direction of the road (North) then it physically turned (not banked) left. I say it turned because at the speed it was traveling (about 60-70 MPH), it any plane would have needed to bank. It flew right above the tree tops (approx. 40-50 feet), made no sound (but a slight whoosh), had no lights, was completely black, didn&apos;t shake the trees, and had no flame from behind (like the flame from a jet). We sat there looking in the sky for about another hour hoping it would come back, completely dumbfounded. We thought it was strange that we would see such a thing in our neighborhood (very busy suburb of Philadelphia) and we were only 12 miles from the Philadelphia International Airport. I would have thought that the airport would have seen it on radar. I can&apos;t be sure of the date, but I know it was summer and we were 13, or 14 (either 1983 or 1984).

It was a beautiful late summer evening, the days were still long and it was just approaching dusk at about 8:30 PM. The sun was at the horizon but had not yet set, even though the sun disc itself was out of sight. I was dozing in a steel framed hammock in thr family back yard when I had an accident that threw me into the air about seven or eight feet. I descended upside down and landed directly on my head. The last thing I remember was a loud snap, cracking sound as my head snapped into my right shoulder. That, except for the incident that I will relate next, may have been the tragic end of the story. The next thing I am aware of is that I am standing up holding onto the nearby handrail. I don&apos;t remember getting up, I&apos;m just up. Then I hear a voice in my head say &quot;Look up&quot;. So I look up, there in the sky, directly overhead (86 - 88 degrees from North Horizon) are three hovering discs, all identical except the middle one is lower than the other two. These discs were the same color as the sky, sunset orange on the West side, and a darker pewter or brownish on the East. I would estimate the diameter to be five inches at arms length for the two at higher altitude, and about 8 inches at arms length for the lower disc. My judgement of the perceived altitude above me was about 120 feet. I yelled at my brother who is already looking at them, &quot;Chuck, LOOK!&quot;. He saw the whole thing. He says that a beam of light came out of one of them and hit me. I cannot verify that, as I was out of commission at the time. After looking up and perceiving the three discs they immediately moved in perfect silent unison, due West to the horizon in about two seconds. Shortly after that I had a long series of REALLY WEIRD nighttime events.Something came into our room almost every night for a long time. When they came I would call to my older brother but he wouldn&apos;t wake. Then his weird experience would happen. I won&apos;t try to describe it here but it was scary, unknown, and very nebulous. I started to draw these figures of flying beings. My school performance went from poor to exceptional. Emotional problems that I had been experiencing seemed to reconcile themselves. My neck has never caused me any pain to this day. My brother still comments on the events of this amazing moment in our lives.

It was flying very low, slower than most small airplanes in a northeast to southwest direction in the general path I-69 follows into Indianapolis.  As the craft flew towards Indy, I could see its silhoutte against the city lights and I saw a small red orb-like light fly up to the craft then a short time later fly back towards the ground.  At the time I didn&apos;t think too much about what I saw, but I seen the same craft that was seen in Belgium, Illinois, etc., and when I realized that others have seen this craft I knew I wasn&apos;t imagining this thing.  In my opinion, if this craft is one of ours then I believe it&apos;s some sort of low and slow stealth reconnaise craft.

We both noticed a bright light at the end of the street.  I initially thought it was the street light.  However, as we drove closer, I saw that it wasn&apos;t the street light.  It was a very bright light about 75 feet to 100 feet or so above and just behind the homes at the end of the street.  It appeared to be in a stationary or hovering position just behind and above the homes.  I parked my car in my parents driveway and walked down the street to see if I could get a closer view of this bright object.  As I walked about 100 feet or so down the street, the bright object slowly (less than 5 mph) began moving toward me.  The bright object was about 75 feet to 100 feet up and made absolutely no sound at all.  As the object moved closer towards me, one of the first things that I could make out was that the craft had an opaque whiteish colored dome. There were red and white lights at the base of the whitish dome that went around the base of the dome in a counter-clockwise direction.   The craft was oval shaped, brass colored and about 15 feet long and 10 feet wide.  It also seemed like there was something like very very faint light blue lines that were emitted around the perimeter of the craft (there was just something about this I can&apos;t explain or be sure of).  The craft was so close and I could see it so clearly that I couldn&apos;t believe I was actually seeing it right before my eyes.  It looked like nothing I had ever seen or experienced before in my life or in this world.  I got this feeling of exhileration and excitement that I never felt before in my life and have never felt since then. The object slowly crossed between our neighbor&apos;s lawn and my parents lawn.  I walked a few feet off the street and stood under a maple tree.  I saw the underside of the craft.  The craft was oval shaped and brass colored.  It had an opaque whitish colored dome with red and white lights at the base of the dome that went around the base of the dome in a counter-clockwise direction.  The perimeter around the base of the craft curved slightly upwards.  The underside of the craft was a brass color and had ridges that ran across the base of the craft (like a ridged potato chip).  It had four bright warm lights (one in front, one in the rear, one on the left and one on the side).  The lights were cylindrical and imbedded in the base of the craft.  They had a very warm yellowish white glow.  At this point my exhilaration started to turn to being a little afraid.   I started to get a little afraid because the craft was almost directly overhead about 100 feet up.  I stood under the maple tree and observed the craft through the leaves. The craft slowly began to pick up speed as it hovered silently over our lawn and across the field behind our house.  It slowly picked up spped from less than 5 miles per hour to about 10 mph to 20 mph.  It traveled across the field toward I-94 in a southeasterly direction.  I went in the house and told my mother about it.  I then called the Michigan State Police Post in Benton Harbor/St. Joseph.   I told the State Police trooper what I had just seen and the direction it was traveling in.  I told him I had never seen a UFO before and that I was not mentally ill or drunk.  The State Police trooper treated my call like it was a joke and said what I had seen was probably a &quot;weather balloon&quot;.  I told him it was not a weather ballon and that the object was headed in a southeasterly direction from St. Joseph, Michigan towards Niles, Michigan. The next day I was reading the Herald-Palladium (local newspaper) and on one of the back pages, there was an article about a UFO being reported by residents in the Allegan, Michigan area the night I observed the UFO in St. Joseph.  Allegan, Michigan is about 60 miles from St. Joseph in Southwestern  Michigan.  An Allegan County Sheriff&apos;s Deputy had responded to the calls from local residents and also observed the UFO himself.", "black object in sky traveling above river, circle of light appearing to come from it lighting up river in just that area of lightOn a hunting trip camping in a big football size field on the bank of the Molalla River - Dickie Prarie.

We watched the light on the river sweeping from side to side, move towards us, past us, until it was approx 300 ft. down river, then the light went off and we could not see any sign of anything at all. We heard no noise even when the light was shining on the river directly infront of our campsite. Another thing we noticed was at the time we heard no frogs, or other noises, just dead quiet other than the river flowing. About an hour later we noticed the frogs again started making their regular noises.  We only saw the circle of light on the river, and the black object (could not tell the size or shape just that the stars did not shine where it was) in the sky, we never saw a beam coming from the oject down to where the circular light was on the river.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As me and my young brother and father were walking through our land on the 9th of April on a Friday night we seen an object floating in the sky. At the beginning we dismissed it as being a helicopter but as it drew closer we grew with fear that it might be an unidentified flying object. The object was coming closer. It was probably first at 12,000 feet above but we started fearing when it dropped quickly to about 7,000 feet. The object which looked like a triangle with three bright balls in each corner was resonating a bright light from all three corners. We got very scared and ran to our home in shock and disbelief but we also kept watching it to see what it was doing. We will never forget what happened for the rest of our lives. The Triangle object then dropped in altitude to about 3000 feet then 2000 feet. It was getting closer the ground. My mother immeditly called the local police and told what was happening. The police skeptically agreed to come to our residence to see what was going on due to the fear that they could hear in my mothers voice. In disbelief we watched the object. My mather and sister were crying as my father and brother and me watched as the object vertically dropped to about 1000 feet. It then navigated for a couple of minutes around the sky brightening the fields. The object then started moving right, then it travelled directly up into the sky - then it camoflaged into a star in the sky.

I thought maybe it was one of the comets I have been hearing about in the news lately so I pulled over to observe it through my binoculars.

My wife snapped several pictures of the object with our digital camera and then the light disappeared after about 5 minutes. We resumed our driving and noticed again, the light in the sky but thought nothing else about it until last night when my wife down loaded the pictures onto our computer.

But it was noticed that numerous 10 or 16 stars, (they were bright as stars, and seemed to be at same distance as stars)They were moving in formation which we could see with our naked eyes.Of course we were all 4 kids, however there parents came outside and they confirmed seeing the same thing.If my perspective is right we were looking very high at the Southwest. We watched these for some time, and then they vanished. I realize if our perceptions were right about distance those lights were covering some major ground.I dont talk to many people about it. However I guess now it was late 80&apos;s I was back home,  and ran into that friend, after we visited for awhile, he said do you remember what we saw in Lago Vista.I realize not nearly as drastic as some sightings but this is truth of what we saw.

They did this in a very random pattern.  Sometimes they would all light up individually at different times and sometimes two or three or four of them would all light up together in different hovering positions in the sky.  Not predictable at all.  One of the other cooks said that they were lighting up and then flying around each other in ways that airplanes or helicopters couldn&apos;t.  He said, &quot;It looked like they were playing tag.&quot;  When I saw them they were very stationary or after some time they would slowly change their positions, but then stop and hover again doing their light show.  Their numbers went from 5 of them and about 20-30 minutes later I went out back with our dishwasher and saw one remaining, but faint.  We were looking to the North from downtown Olympia by the Farmer&apos;s Market on the water.  They also seemed to be in the flight path of airplanes flying into Sea-Tac.  Pilots must have seen something weird...  Right before they would lost all their light, I could see a very tiny object behind the light and I would say it was saucer shaped, although it looked very far away right before it disappeared.  When they would light up though, they were bright.  Not a star in the sky at the time, you could only see the moon and these things lit up brighter and with more intensity and solid white light than anything I&apos;ve seen in the sky.  A good handful of customers saw them as well.  One guy even called up our local paper here, the Olympian, to tell them what was going on.  He said he is in the military and had never seen anything like that so he called it in.  I checked after the sun went down and I didn&apos;t see anything.  I think that their light came from the sun, because the sun was directly behind us whil! e looking at them.  As the sun went down, the less and less intense the lights became.  Like they had as much light to show us as the sun had to give them.  They were brighter than any airplane light, planet or even Venus right now.  It was rad.", "I was amazed!

My son told me to look at the &quot;moving stars&quot; in the sky.I&apos;ve studied anatomy,I was shocked at what I seen. This &quot;spacecraft&quot; was bright like a lightbulb.

I realized that it wasn&apos;t a flock but a grayish transparent chevron shape. In a matter of 5 seconds it flattened out into a cigar shape that was no wider than the original chevron shape. As it was flattening, 6 bright but tiny green lights appeared in a somewhat circular shape where the chevron shape had been (see drawing). They stayed this way for about 2 seconds before they began to converge into 1 green light. This single light was stationary and slowly dimmed for about 6 seconds. Then the green light flared up to a very bright green light, but did not change in size. I can only describe it like sunlight shining on greenish chrome. At this point the bright green light slowly began to move south. It picked up speed rapidly and continued south and had a thin green trail following it.

I noticed a faint beam of light coming down upon a fielded area several miles away, it seemed. I looked to see where it was coming from as I drove my car.  My son and I both saw that it came from what appeared to be a star.  It seemed   unimaginable that a beam of white light could be coming from that far of a distance or that it was really happening.  There wasn&apos;t a car to be seen, or house light, and I admit that it was very chilling and I decided not to stop. We thought for sure that it would be all over the news. We don&apos;t have any idea how long it had been there, or how long it lasted.The beam was about 1/4th of an inch wide [looking at the sky], and was about 1/2 of an inch as it came to the ground.

The 911 dispatch center called the National Weather Service to check if they had anything on radar in that vicinity, and they confirmed that they had unexplained &quot;blips&quot; on radar between 5,000 and 12,000 feet moving southwest near the Lake Michigan shoreline towards Chicago.  The radar showed the &quot;blips&quot; intercepting and moving apart into multiple returns on the screen, and of a size on the screen larger than that of normal aircraft.

In fact, Robert Gribble, founder and director of the National UFO Reporting Center at the time of the incident, was instrumental in the capture of the radar data of the objects over Lake Michigan.  He called the National Weather Service, and recommended that they use their radar in order to detect the objects, which was successful.  It was  NWS radar operator who spoke with a Michigan Highway Patrolman, and both of them were looking at the objects, the patrolman visually, and the operator using radar. Interestingly, there was a dramatic sighting of a presumed UFO over the University District of Seattle on the night of the event over Lake Michigan.

We live in a small town with rural area beyond.  I noticed 4-5 bright orange/gold lights hovering on the horizon.  They looked like roman candles ready to go out.  I said &quot;look&quot; to my husband and he saw them too.  Then they instantly disappeared.", "First let me say I am a police officer in the Metro-Denver area and have been for 26 yrs. My wife and I were at John Martin State Park. There had been a drowning the previous week and portions of the lake were closed off since the Park Rangers had not recovered the body of a 17yr that had drowned. There was alot of government activity at this time from state,federal, and county personnel. The navy had flown in a special sonar to try help locate the body of the victim. The incident that was witnessed by my wife and I took place on a camp ground called Point Overlook. We were in our RV and were the only ones at the campgound excluding a Park Ranger in a vehicle approximately 2miles away. We were approximately 300 hundred feet from the lake and approximately 30 feet above the water on a bluff overlooking the lake, hence the name of the campground. My wife had just retired to the bed and I was in the process of securing the RV as we planned to get up early and go fishing. This a lake with approximately 3500 acres of surface water and a fairly large concrete dam. This lake is approximately 8 miles long and 1 mile wide. We were camped approximatley 4miles from the dam. I first saw a bright light comming from the dam heading west. I initially thought it might be a helo looking for the drowning victim as early in the day the authorities had used an airplane and dive teams. This light came closer it became apparent that it was not a single light but six lights strung together. The first was white with the succeeding lights red blue red blue and amaber at the end. It appeared that the lights were connected by some sort of stucture. I estimate the length of these lights to be 600 feet in length. I yelled at my wife to get up. She did in time to see the lights stop directly perpendicular to our RV. The lights were directly over the lake, altitude approximatley 500ft distance to object was 500ft. The lights stopped and rotated. I was in the process of getting the camera and bicnoculars and wife was w! atching the lights. I did not seet the lights stop and rotate she did. She states that when the craft rotated she could clearly see that it was a craft disk in shape with a dome stucture on top. She also stated that what we thought were lights were windows with lumanting lights from inside the craft. By the time I turned around the craft &quot;winked&quot; out. That is the best description I can give for its rapid disappearance. The whole thing lasted no more than 5-10 seconds for me.  I had an opportunity to talk to the Park Ranger that was 2 miles away the next morning and she asked me if I saw anything unusal. I told her and asked her if she saw anything. She said that in the past week they all have seen stange lights in and aroung the lake. She also said that they talk amoung themselves but that supervision frowned on making any offical report.

There are 6 manned towers. The 6 officers, including myself, passed the time by talking via 49mhz radio. Toward the east, someone&apos;s attention was caught by a very bright light a few feet above the horizon. It looked like landing lights on the front of a 747 heading toward us. A few remarks were made and subject was changed. Apx 15mins later one of the guys mentioned that the lights were still there but were closer. We commented on how it should have been way gone by now (since we believed it to be a commercial jet.) We watched it for another 15 mins and could see that it was moving very slowly, like a helo. The night sky was crystal clear and moon-less. No city lights or anything to dim the view at the sky. The craft got close enough that we could see 5 lights, each one as if on the corner of a pentagon. The craft came directly overhead, no sound at all. We thought it possible to be 5 helos in formation, but found it wierd that we did not hear them. When it passed over, we saw it to be one craft. We could not see anything between the lights and did not realize it was a single craft until it blocked the view of stars as it passed over. We could not tell how high it was but agreed that it was as large as a jumbo jet and flying at an altitude that private planes usually fly. We watched for another 20-30 mins until it was out of view. The the lights on the rear of the craft looked exactly like the front. Bright white lights. No flashing lights. No exhaust. No sound.

What was odd was that there was no flashing lights or any lighting required by airplanes and hellicopters. The sphere had a soft amber light luminescence to it. In the end it headed east towards Cleveland national park then the sphere slowly faded away. I ruled out a blimp as it was 4am in the morning and no attractions going on. It was not a hellicopter or plane for it had no flashing lights or blue or red of any kind. Planes only fly that low over orange county to land at John Wayne Airport. There is no such flight path as it headed east instead of south to Irvine. Most convincing was how it remained idle or barely moving for about a minute.

IT was about five to eight miles away to the east.It continued to steadily move and came very close to to Brenton Point.It glowed and I could not see the shape clearly as the light of the object made the  edges diffuse but strong.  The light was just a curiousity to me.  Then it shot south so fast that I could not follow it.  I moved and looked to the south and it was there stationary about what I thought was about 15 miles.  It stayed there for quite a while then it shot off to the east and zipped out of sight.  A short while later some jets from Quonset came from the direction of Newport and headed straight out to where the light had been.They soon headed back.

It traveled silently and slowly from east to west. The ball of light had pointed spikes of light dancing around the edges of the ball. The power lines were running through the easement between the properties.  I was about 60 to 70 feet from the light. As the light passed over to the neighbor&apos;s property to the left of me, it paused--then one of the spikes of light shot down, through the chain link fence, right up to me! The light &quot;beam&quot; was about 3 inches wide and thin as a sheet of paper--and tapered to a sharp spike. I don&apos;t know if it actually touched me, if not, it came within an inch or two of me. The spike of light remained about 20 to 30 seconds, then it withdrew back into the ball of light and began moving slowly west again.  When the spike of light extended out to me, all of the rest of the dancing spikes of light stopped moving. After the spike withdrew back into the ball of light, all of the spikes of light began dancing again.  At that point, I ran into the house to tell my mother what I had seen.

The formation was much larger than any plane could have been, even if it was at low altitude-the formation was approx. half the area of the inside of the little dipper, which is where we first spotted it.  the object continued to move at a fairly good clip, at one point obstructing the view of another stationary star, until it faded from view.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

My Brother ((name deleted)) has written into your program on his UFO sighting encounter.  As apart of his story, I also was a witness to this event.The day of the event was July 26th, 1977, the time 2PM.  I had noticed that beautiful, cleared skied Summer day, that my Brother ((name deleted)) was laying out on the lounge chair soaking in the sun.  Next thing I knew there was alot of commotion going on outside as I heard him saying &quot;Oh my God, look at that&quot; !  I ran to the back door, and asked him what was going on, he said, &quot; Get out here, look at this, it&apos;s incredible&quot;.So I rushed out to the backyard, and as he pointed up to the sky, my focus targeted on six flying objects.  One large object in the middle, and four to five smaller objects in a formation surrounding the larger craft. The objects seemed to be way up in the atmosphere, and appeared to be &quot; a strange attraction&quot; to me because the objects just hovered, and definitely did not act as the flight of a plane craft would.  Suddenly, the smaller objects started to perform  pulsating, multidirectional maneuvers that planes or other craft would never be able to maneuver.  Then all of the flying objects moved across the sky together in the same formation, surrounding the larger object, and continued to maneuver this strange multidirectional flying pattern.  This type of event continued on for what seemed a minimal of ten to fifteen minutes.  Then in a blink of an eye, they all took off in different directions and were gone !!

I could not move and my Siamese cat was beside me (2 times) and did not move and his body felt rigid.  Red lights whirled as if a red light rotating on top. RRR-rrr-RRR-rrr sound as it landed and the whole time. We had a part wolf dog who did not bark. The object stayed in the garden for about 10 minutes, it seemed but probably was less. Then it shot off and I was very aware of the dopler effect when it left. I think the lights became white when it took off. This happened 4 times over a period of 2 years and usually when my father&apos;s garden was flourishing. He had a lot of hybrid corn that he aquired from a friend. I told my family (I was 25-26 year of age at the time but spent Summers with my family) and they sort of laughed. Then my brother who had the room next to mine had the same experience and he heard someone going up the steps that went up to the upper yard and then believed me.  My father finally heard it and saw flashing lights in the upper yard (their bedroom was upstairs and on the other side of the house). This was probably five years after my experiences. My Father heard the sound and saw red lights through drapes but by the time he got up to look it took off.  Some years ago I mentioned to a friend who had just moved to Prune Hill if she had ever seen UFO&apos;s there and she gasped----She awakened her whole family and they watched a UFO in binoculars for 45 minutes in the middle of the night. This was probably 10 years ago. Camas is a papermill town and helicopters sometimes were heard there patroling the river where logs were often kept and I thought this was it at first but no chopper blade sounds. It was too close and I would have heard the blades. My explanation of landing there several times was to get samples from the garden.

I saw it up there, toward the cliff house- it was silver with some spikes sticking out, jutting out of two of its sides- like black poles which were sticking up. It also seemed to have a tail at one end- kind of like a stalk stem of a mushroom. I looked around me to see if anyone else was seeing it. I stopped and tried to see if I could flag someone down to look, too. I kept thinking, &quot;God, is that a UFO?&quot; There was noone likely to stop, it somehow didn&apos;t seem appropriate and the beach wasn&apos;t that crowded. It was sunny, clear, I know what I saw and it was very weird. Anyway, the even weirder thing is is how I actually felt looking at it- extremely serene and calm; it was almost like whoever was in charge of it or actually in it wanted me to see it. It lasted a long time, about 1 minute. I remember thinking, &quot;This is like on Art Bell.&quot; I&apos;ve neevr felt whatever it was I was feeling before or since when I saw it. I also rwemember thinking, &quot;What&apos;s gong to happen?&quot;  I kept my eye on it and next thing I knew it was gone. One second there, the next, out. It was a ways up in the sky- you&apos;d need to be looking at that patch of sky to see it or be looking at that general area and then maybe it would get your attention. Like I said, I&apos;m used to looking at that area of the sky on walks-.

While stopped at a stop light at the levee heading north towards on SR 43, my husband noticed 3 small lights pretty far up in the sky.  One light came on, then another a second or two later, then the third light.  Then the first one went off and the other two followed in succession.  At first we thought - fireworks.  But that didn&apos;t make any sense because we didn&apos;t see the trail going up into the air and the lights didn&apos;t appear to &quot;fall&quot; like fireworks typically do.  We kind of blew it off.  Then about 5 minutes later - we saw the same thing again.  The lights were east of us, across the Wabash river some distance away but we didn&apos;t appear to be moving away from them.  About another 5 minutes later, we saw them again.  Then again a 4th time before they stopped which was right before we went under the overpass at I65 and SR43.  The 4th time we saw them, they appeared to be almost directly above us.  We couldn&apos;t be sure which way they were moving, but it appeared to us that they were moving north northwest.  In each occurrance, the lights were yellow/orange in color.  They would light up, then disappear in succession.  Sometimes they had smaller lights around them, sometimes, they didn&apos;t.", "I was returning from the first Vietnam Moratorium (that is how I fix the date accurately) in Boston with some friends in an old VW bus. The VW was starting to act up(I don&apos;t suspect any UFO effects - just a typical college junker VW) so we exited I-95 and got onto a side road south of exeter and portsmouth, NH.As we started up a hill with the VW it started to die and did so part way up the hill. Well there was a light on at a house about 150 yards up the road (the only house around) and so we walked up to the house and asked to use the phone. I called my roommate and asked for him to pick us up. We went back to the VW and sat there waiting and looking out the window at the night sky. After a few minutes I saw some lights (pretty much tiny discs to points of light positioned to the right side of our vehicle) in the sky that were moving in a way I had never seen. They would move in different directions and in different ways. A typical move would be to move in a straight line and then take a 90 degree turn without slowing down. I am familiar with aircraft movement since I lived near Pease air base and was used to seeing the high speed f-111&apos;s that were stationed there. These lights were in the 30 to 80 degree range off the horizon and were moving at times at speeds like a jet fighter and at other times they would be still in the air. One even was still in the sky and then just took off at speed , went up in the sky and disappeared. One time several moved to a single point in the sky but there always seemed to be 6 or 8 or maybe more craft visible at any time.There came a time when I caught sight of a Cigar shaped craft moving slowly through my field of vision and across the road we had come up to our present  position. The craft continued to moveacross the road and settled down over what seemed to be a field on the other side of the road and by this time I was 50 to 75 yards down the road from the VW and on the left side of the road. I was somewhat excited when it settled down and was furth! er conflicted when lights came on and blinked around the craft. I say around the craft because a light would blink from right to left and as it reached the left of the craft it would disappear and shortly thereafter it would reappear blinking at the right edge of the craft.I say the plural lights since I believe there were many lights with only one coming on at a time. And there were other lights that stayed on that appeared to be windows above the centerline where the blinking lights were located. I had mixed emotions at this point - wonder and fear. I turned and ran over to my friends up the road - they nwere still watching other lights- and told them there was something they have to see. We headed back to where we could see the cigar and it was gone. Some traffic came by- one stoppedto see if we needed help and after that all craft were gone. The whole experience from first sighting was probably about20 - 30 minutes and the cigar sighting I had was in the 2-4 minute range.", "Two blueish white lights horizontal from one another  with very skinny but long middle peice that makes a dumbell shapeI saw an object as we were heading up Fraser mountain in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia. Me and my one passanger on my left side were almost to the peak of the road when i noticed a large shinging light to my left I asked my passanger &quot;what the hell is that thing?&quot;. They responded with &quot;I dont know?&quot;.  We pulled over and viewed the object with two very bright lights, whiteish blue, flashing on an offset pattern horizontally from one another with no visable shape in the middle and flying very qucikly and at a very low altitude coming towards us. It was at about 10:10 pm EST and was very clear and dark ngiht with a few stars out.  We turned around in a drive way and started to assend down the mountin. I pulled over and looked back and the object was a minimum of 300 meters off the ground at the peak of the mountin hovering with both lights now staying on at the same time very brightly. We then drove away quickley to the bottom of the hill and turned right. This was 5 minutes into the viewing.I asked &quot;where is it?&quot; but it was nowhere in sight. 20 seconds later as we were driving towards melmerby beach road I saw the object now both lights flashing offsetly again coming towards us at a very low altiutde and quite rapidly. I have no idea how the oject got from the top of the mountin to infront of us in that short amount of time and with such grace. I periodcally asked my passenger &quot; are you seeing this?&quot;, &quot;do you belive this?&quot;. We turned into a road on the left to park to again view the object coming towards us it was getting larger and larger, the closer it came. Both lights were now flashing at the same time and both were still bluish white. This was viewed in a heavily populated residential area but no other vehicles or people were visable to us. It was about 1000M away now and i turned left to go down the melmerby road back towards fraser mountin. I looked back and way the two lights now vertical from one another (one on top of the other with a space in between of darkness) as it the object wen! t straig ht up in the air. The radio began to crackle at this time. This was about 8 min into the viewing. We took a right and were in downtown new glasgow and then took another right and were on the road heading towards the power station in trenton. This is about 10 minutes after we first saw the object, we both looked to our right in the sky and the object was now visable in the sky at a quite low altitude. Once again the blueish white lights were falshing offsetly they were horizontal from one another again with the shape in the middle not visable. As we drove down this road both me and the passanger rolled down our windows and there was no noise whatsoever. The object slowed to a halt, it flipped verticaly so the lights were now one ontop of one another and for the first time we saw a very smooth, greyscale shape in the middle not very wide at all, liek a dumbell. The object the fly away very quickey and that was the last we saw of it. The viewing ended at about 10:23 PM EST.

We left her house at about 6:10p.m. to 6:20p.m. on Sunday night as we were returning home to Alpharetta, Georgia (my son needed to be in bed by about 9:30p.m./ he was 9 yrs. old at the time). We had been gone from my mom&apos;s house for about 15 minutes, we turned on Shoal Creek Rd. heading towards the city square of Dawsonville. There seemed to be almost no traffic on this winding country road. As we rounded a lazy turn in the road, my son &amp; I witnessed, at VERY CLOSE range, what appearred to be a &quot;Black Triangle&quot; shaped craft. It was barely at tree top level (approximately 100 feet)directly in front of us. It was floating,kind of rocking in a bizzare manner, slowly from left to right. I can only compare this to a &quot;Puppett&quot; on a string. This object was floating, almost dancing,&amp; appeared to be turned up on its sides. The sides were un-equal in length (I think it would be classified as an &quot;Isosalyes Triangle, math teacher would be proud).Anyway, we were in a state of shock from what we were witnessing (I assumed this later that night). In each corner on underside of craft, were dark blue/neon type lights. These lights were not overly bright at this time. They seemed to be casting a blueish hue, towards the center, where we observed what I can only describe as two straight lines, one a little higher than the next,similar to the number 11 with half-square parenthesis on each side of the vertical 11 lines. The square-like parenthesis were off-set from each other, the one on the left side was higher up than the one on the right. Me or my son, either one can still draw this perfectly. It looked perhaps like some form of insignia. The craft just floated right in front of us, across the road to the other side. as soon as I intially saw this object, I swerved off the road &amp; slammed on the brakes. We were not going very fast anyway. This object was approximately 200&apos;ft. directly in front of us &amp; about 100&apos;ft high. This all! seemed so damn surreal! As this object/craft floated slowly to the other side of this road, we just sat there in my truck (Lexus RX 300) observing this obvious un-earthly vehicle. I say this because of the movement,shape, ect.. When it reached the right side of the road,(where we were sitting), the craft seemed to just &quot;blink-off&quot;. It was gone, just like somebody turned off a light switch.

I pulled into our driveway, opened the garage door, pulled truck into carport &amp; we just sat there staring ahead, facing the wall in the carport with the truck still running. We sat there, silently, for maybe 5 minutes, when all of sudden at the same time we both slowly turned towards each other and asked,&quot;What the heck just happened&quot;? We did not immediately talk about this. For some reason, I told my son to go inside the house &amp; draw whatever he saw. I did the same out in my truck. I went inside &amp; then we compared drawings. We then realised that we had indeed witnessed the exact same thing. This drive normally takes 45-50 minutes.

Before I forget any of the details I would like to report what I saw. I live in the middle of the city in a highrise apartment building on the 17th floor. I was watching TV and then my husband told me there was sparks at the sky. So he got my attention and I looked out at the window and sure enough there was something peculiar.  At first there was only a few of these red lights or these red star like objects. There was a tall building blocking  a part of my panoramic view of the sky, so it looked like these objects are coming from behind that building.  And then it kept on coming, lots and lots of it...  I&apos;d say hundreds or more, lots of them! And they floated upwards toward the sky slowly, dispersing themselves as they move, distancing themselves from each other (from my point of view). There was no sound and we were just watching it in awe. Never seen anything like it. I&apos;m a UFO skeptic and also a backyard astronomer.  I&apos;d like to call this a natural phenomenon, but nothing fits the description.  What ever it is that I saw I highly doubt that its a meteor shower, because it doesn&apos;t come from a point in the sky. Rather it comes from just above the horizon and floated upwards, traveling from west to north of the night sky before it dissapeared slowly.  It wasn&apos;t a firework either, there was no noise at all.  I&apos;m pretty sure other people would see it, because it happened in the center of Bangkok.((NUFORC Note:  We assumed that the witness might have been looking at a fireworks display, or something along those lines, but if she has experience as an astronomer, she should have been able to rule out such a possibility at the time of the sighting.

Upon crossing under the Harlem Ave. overpass, I noticed a single cherry-red colored light hanging motionless in the sky south/southwest of the expressway at about a 70 degree angle to the horizon. It was about the size and intensity of a very bright star.  At first I thought it to be the port-side red wing light on a plane but the odd thing was there were no other navigation lights visible (no belly or tail strobe, no green starboard wing light, etc.) I also thought that it might be a star or planet at first, but as I drove westward I eventally passed under it at which time it was then behind me (but still motionless in the same position on the sky). I then got off of I-80 and headed southbound on U.S. Route 45 (LaGrange Rd.) and the light was still there in it&apos;s original position with my car now headed south and the light being to my left still at about 70 degrees to the now eastern horizon.  Although I couldn&apos;t tell how big or high up it really was, I got the impression that it was lower than planes would be heading into Midway Airport (I was at 19500 south and Midway is at 6300 south on the Chicago area&apos;s street grid).  Also of note was there was no noise, and if it were a helicopter, I think I would have been close enough to hear the rotors, see other navigation lights and probably even see some of the body of a helicopter.  There was no shape discernible here...just the bright, hovering pinpoint of light.  After briefly heading west on 195th St., I then turned south, but when I looked for the light in the eastern sky, it was gone.  I noticed the light had a vey crisp, clean color to it...no twinkling like a star and it&apos;s color was differant than a red radio antanea light or plane wing light...it was almost the shade of those old &quot;blue dot&quot; taillights or maybe those bright new LED lights used on new stop lights and railroad crossings.

PD))((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS))Tinley Park Follow-upI was the individual who submitted the original Tinley Park &quot;red light&quot; sighting back in April. I can&apos;t possibly imagine that the light was caused by advertising lasers as there would be absolutely no way to determine where the advertiser was located on the ground (hence not a very effective means of advertising).....also, there was no light trail leading to a spot on the ground like a traditional advertising spot light would have (either the single oscillating beam kind or the newer 4 -beam type that makes the &quot;figure-8&apos;s&quot; in the sky).  Also, when I saw the light, it was in the early AM when all retail would be closed.  While brighter than a star, it really wouldn&apos;t have been all that noticable unless you looked up into that exact area of the sky and you realized it wasn&apos;t the &quot;normal&quot; red color of an airplane wing light and that it was stationary (in other words, it didn&apos;t appear to be anything designed to attract the attention of peo ple on the ground).  Lastly, the area I saw it over contains warehouses, some residential subdivisions and vacant fields but no retail or late night places such as bars or all-night restraunts. Here&apos;s a thought - The Tweeter Center (the Chicago area&apos;s main outdoor music amphitheater) isn&apos;t far away from the area in Tinley Park where I saw the light....could they possibly have a laser projection system that was pointed upward instead of towards the stage???  I&apos;ve been to Tweeter in the past however and I think all of their lighting and projection stuff is under a pavilion roof so it wouldn&apos;t have exposure to the sky...also I don&apos;t recall any clouds the evening I saw the light that a laser would bounce off of....it just seemed to be hovering mid-air in a clear sky (but no indication of anything solid attached to, or behind the light).  Also, I think 4/24 was too early in the season for Tweeter to be having concerts and even if they were, the event  would have been long over at the time I passed the area.

As I was walking I looked up in the sky. (for no apparent reason)  I was looking at all the stars in the sky on this clear night when I saw something that has puzzled me for almost 30 years. I glared at an object that was approx: 500 feet higher than the large oak trees that it had hovered and traveled and  past from the south. This object was round in shape with lights that wrapped around it. I would have to say the size of this object was as big as Niagara Falls in diameter and height.

Although I was young I new I was witnessing something with a much greater intellect than ours. I new even at that age, airplanes make noise. Blimps don&apos;t fly in the dark, hot air balloons don&apos;t fly in the dark and weather balloons don&apos;t have florescent lights. This object was completely silent. This object also came to a complete stop directly over me for about 2 minutes then flew over the QEW heading over to the Burlington Skyway eventually out of my sight.

While fying a kite, I noticed what appeared to be 3 silver objects that were in the shape of discs.  They were at such a high altitude (25,000 ft.?)it is difficult to describe them in detail.

During their movement, they would also align themselves in a triangular formation.  I pointed out the objects to the person with me, who also witnessed the UFOs.  After about 5 minutes of observing the UFOs, they disappeared.  I am not sure how the UFOs departed, but when I looked away and tried to refocus my eyes on the objects, they were no longer there.

The witness was on her way to work as she works the graveyard shift. As she traveled around a corner on Harris Road by Harris Auto Wrecking she saw a extremely large bright pink object low in the sky. The lady said she had never seen anything like it in all the years she lived in the area and also wondered if it might have been an airplane coming in for a landing at the Smithers airport. She told me the object had to have been the size of a full moon and on the outer edge of the object the color was a much lighter pink in color. As the woman drove along she said it passed overhead at approx: tree top level and at approx: 100 to 200 feet away from her in distance. As the lady and the object passed one another she slowed her truck down and turned around to watch the object move slowly into the distance and as she watched it finally just blinked out. When the woman continued on her journey, after seeing the strange object, she told me that she was questioning herself, &quot;did I just see that&quot;!  Later that evening and at her work place, her and another lady went outside for a coffee break and the witness mentioned that she had seen something very strange when she was on her way to work. I asked the lady if she thought it might have been a flare or even fireworks someone had maybe set off. The witness said she has never seen a flare or fireworks travel horizontally just over tree top level and for such a long distance. There was no sound noted.

( KINDA LIKE A LAWNMOWER) THIS WENT ON FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER TEN MINUTES. I REALIZED THAT THE SOUND WAS GENERATED FROM THE GLARING LIGHTS IN THE SKY OUTSIDE MY WINDOW.  AT THAT POINT I BEGAN TO THINK IT WAS SOMESORT OF UFO. I MEAN I DIDN&apos;T REALLY BELIEVE IN THEM UNTILL THEN. THE BRIGHT LIGHTS BEGAN TO SHIMMER A BIT AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN BOLTED AWAY. I FELT A SENSE OF PRESENSE LIKE I NEVER HAVE BEFORE. AT THAT POINT AND TIME I REALIZED THAT I HAD ENCOUNTERED SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL, SOMETHING SOO UNBELIEVABLY DIFFERENT THAT I COULDNT SLEEP THE WHOLE REST OF THE NIGHT. I TRIED TELLIN MY PARENTS BUT THEY THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY AND TOLD ME THAT IT WAS PROBABLY JUST STARS BUT I DIDN&apos;T BELIEVE THEM......SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN WATCHING OUT MY WINDOW FOR THEM BUT I HAVENT ENCOUNTERED THEM AGAIN.", "08/29/1967  9:31 pm  saucer shaped object, change positions, wobbled ,stopped, watched for15 minutesObserved a dull yellow object hovering in the southern sky. It moved in a slow erratic path due north, sometimes appearing to wobble, stop and move again. As it moved overhead of my position the object was about the size of a dime held at arms length, I also could make out a blue halo of light around the outer rim and a yellow glow from the center of (crafts) belly. I ran into our house and yelled for my mother to come outside and we watched the UFO as it would dissappear and reappear at a higher altitudes.It also seemed to change shape as if it were plasma but it was far to our north by now and getting lost in the haze of city lights, it also seemed to be joined by another light but it was so far away it was hard to tell from our position. We never saw or heard any reports in the newspaper of what we saw, and later tried to contact Len Stringfield at his office in Cincinnati but he was out of town, and didnt contact us about it.", "Saw  the same object , twice, out to sea , while serving in U.S. Navy.I was serving in the U.S. Navy at the time, serving on a destroyer. We were out to sea for at least a month when this occured. We were out in or near the Carribeans in the atlantic ocean. We had been circling in a navigation box for at least a few days with the rest of our battle group. The first incident occured when we were undergoing an unrep(taking on fuel)from a naval tanker.It was already dark and the entire crew was out on deck preparing for this unrep. I was standing on the flight deck with some of my shipmates when I noticed that the fuel tanker had an unusual amount of lights on it&apos;s mast. Lots. I just kept staring at this mast, then suddenly I noticed that some these lights separated from the rest of the mast. At first I thought it was the helo(helocopter) but our helocopter was secured inside and I could clearly see the other ships helocopter on their flight deck. Now I could see 5-6 white lights in a sort of arch formation following us. Nobody else seemed to see this. I stared at this object for at least 2 min. then I tried to tell my shipmates to look at it, but before I could finish my sentence the object turned one light off then the rest of the lights shut off in order! I thought it was so strange but I had no time to dwell on it because I had work to do.The second incident happened a few days later when we were preping a old destroyer for target practice the next day. It was dusk and there was still light in the sky.We were sitting dead in the water, when I came out for my watch duty at the back of the ship(fantail) My Friend came back to visit me and to have a cigarette. We were both paying attention to what our crew was doing with the old destroyer, when I turned around and saw to my right the same 5-6 white lights or orbs, in a row, not even 50-70 yards away! My friend turned around at that time and saw them too. I knew from my training that it wasn&apos;t military or commercial aircraft. The weird thing was, was that this object made no sound at all, nor was it moving in any way. I noticed that there was no mass or structure to it, just white lights or orbs an arms length apart. Please remember that it was dusk and I saw nothing but lights. I don&apos;t know how long it was there before we noticed it, but it was definately looking right at us. After about 2-3 min. of this it did the same thing again, it shut off one light(from my left) then the rest shut off in a row. Then it was just gone! Heard nothing, saw nothing. My friend freaked out and ran off leaving me there all alone to stand the rest of my watch all night. When I confronted my friend the nexy day, he refused to talk about it and ran off, clearly disturbed. It took me a few days to realize that it was the same object I seen that night we were taking on fuel. Now this is a real story, I&apos;m not crazy, I saw what I saw. Has anybody had a similar incident, please let me know.  (oh, I tried to alert operations about what I saw, but they saw no aircraft on their radar)((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When I came out of the house for some reason I walked over to the end of the proch (about 5 feet from the door) and out of the corner of my eye I saw this bight object a few hundred feet it appeard in the sky... i thought oh a plane so i turned to look at it because I like seeing planes at night they are kinda neat... but i thought to myself as i saw it out of the corner of my eye... wait somethings not right its not blinking... how planes usually blink diffrent colors on their wings and such... and it was just hovering there... so i turned twards it to look (this is about a span of 10 seconds) and when i turned to look at it about 5 seconds into the stare at it hover it was like it knew i was looking at it... and suddenly it droped straight down behind the hill (there is a hill off in the distance about half a mile and it has trees all over it) i got a little scared at that point because that was just wierd... i knew it couldnt of been a helicopter because they dont move a few hundred feet in half a second straight down unless they are crashing and yet that is still fast at that point... so i turned away for some reason and it poped back up like it was plaing hide and seek with me... i got freaked out and went back in our house... i looked out the front window and it was there again hovering... but once agian when i looked at it... it droped down behind the hill and trees.. i stood there in shock for aboug 5 minutes then all the sudden it quickly poped back up in the air and the strangest thing happend... it grew from a relatively big spot of white to this bright yellow/orange fast flickering oval shape about 20x as big... and as it did that i got this sudden head ache that lasted from when it got big to about 30 seconds after... whic! h when it stoped it just disappeared like vanished in air...i dont know what happened... so i ran to wake up my parents (im at their house) my sister and her boy friend.. we all stood there stareing... they started making jokes i was seeing things then all the sudden about 10 minutes into the state out the window it appeared again.. this time we all saw it.. it did the same thing agian hovered and hid.. but the wierd thing.. this time when it came back it kinda snuck back from behind the hill and hid in the trees... we could see it behind the trees hovering (keep in mind this is about half a mile away) we stood there shocked for a while and it disappeared again... i called the state police and reported it the said another person just reported a similar thing in the same area when i was talking to them... then the odd thing that happend all the sudden it showed up agian but this time this trail showed up behind it kinda like a firework trail looks like as it flys up in the air.. but this trail just stayed there for about 10 seconds then just vanished.. we were really confused at that point... the last time we saw it tonight while stareing my mother and I saw it jet off in a diagonal pattern (before this it was just up and down) and it vanished... we stood there for about 30 minutes after and nothing... I must admit I am scared as heck... and not much scares me... I cant even sleep tonight, im honestly scared to... it&apos;s 4:18 in the morning right now.. this happened around midnight :&#x5C; you can see how I feel just from that... I am a religious person, and I&apos;m telling this to you with God as my whitness that this actually happened tonight... I don&apos;t think I could be more frightened then I am tonight...

Thats what I thought until....Approaching a gate to secure where I work, I drove towards it on the road where trees cover both side of road. As I put the vehicle in park to exit it. I seen a fireball type falling star, which started above me out of view but I happened to catch it once in it came over the vehicle and in view through the windshield. It followed the line of the road directly overhead. I thought I was watching a shooting start. It was blue in color and left a nice long blue tail as it streak down the sky. I would almost describe as a typical falling start, fireball blue with blue tail. I wasn&apos;t surprised at all since I have seen many fireballs over the years. I even began making a wish when out of my amazement the falling star had stopped falling and actually shot horizontily across the sky. When first observed, it was approx 90degrees overhead (directly overhead, very high like a typical shooting star)traveling from north to south. I was facing south with my vehicle. Apporx right in front of me (south) at about 30 degrees ahead of me the object shot due east and out of sight over the tree line. It never stopped but moved continusely. Like I said I was making a wish like you typically due when you see a shooting star and as I was near the end of my wish is when this star? just shot east. I am very confused as what I saw and never have seen anything like this before. I know what time it was exactly because the gate was supposed to be closed at a certain time. The duration of this lasted about 4-7seconds. I never heard anyhting but the crickets in the woods.", "The sphere&apos;s that observed us on the beach, may have also scrammbled the event memory.My parents raised me as a nomad, you could say.  We lived in a 12-man tent, and went to many auspicious places.  I remember that I was young (9) perhaps, all the bonfire parties were over etc. 11pm-3am and I don&apos;t really know the exact date.  We were taking a beach stroll, gazing at the stars etc.  Many objects of light surrounded us, kind of like fireflies; we stood there for 15mins or so maybe longer, (while they observed us).  My father was a very intelligent man, not one to mistake anything.  So after we walked back to our VW bug talking about what we&apos;d all just experienced and drove down the freeway a bit I began to draw a picture of what I&apos;d seen.  If I remember correctly they were, either all sphere&apos;s or some were triangle, some maybe square, and that they were either all different illuminating colors or opalescent/reflective.  They seemed large, out of this world, but right there like fireflies.  Ok, so I give my mother the picture and she say&apos;s something like &quot;That&apos;s cute honey but they were much bigger.&quot; and my dad said some thing about them not being colorful, that they were dark black or silver, maybe reflective.  We argued back and forth for a while, and then we all felt weird like they&apos;d gone in saw who we were etc and then erased our memory, or scrambled it.  Perhaps messages that I now see. One thing I know, while we walked back to the bug we all agreed, and knew what we&rsquo;d seen thought it was awesome etc. and then the memory faded away, very, very quickly.  I wish I still had that picture. When men in black the movie came out and they zapped their memory away, it was funny but real.  I&rsquo;ll write of my most recent soon.   Everything matters, yet once you know that, then nothing matters! Lol((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "UFOs visited our Minuteman ICBMS during the summer of 1966 and I was there.Another old sighting.  I was a System Analyst for SAC in the early 1960 and stationed at Ellsworth AFB, SD.   I  held the nation&apos;s highest security clearances, daily handled nuclear weapons and carried launch codes and keys.  I thus took no drugs, was a tea toddler and have never hallucinated in my life.  I was on active duty at the time. This was early summer 1966.  I was on base during the evening, when excited reports of UFOs on our silos were being passed around in the living quarters among the men person to person.  &quot;Excited utterances,&quot; they are called in legal jargon.  I went down to Job Control, which tracked the 150 missiles and the ten Launch Control Centers.  These Centers were manned, twenty-four seven, while the missiles are unmanned. That evening, in Hotel Flight, as I recall, we had an &quot;outer zone security violation,&quot; meaning that something had passed over the silo....this is often blowing vegetation or a light footed animal. The system will generally reset with the manual override. However this silo did not reset. Worse it was soon followed by an &quot;inter zone violation,&quot; meaning that something large enough to set off the vibration sensors or to touch the combinations locks, etc., was on the site. When the violations happen in this order, the manual calls for  a &quot;strike team&quot; to be dispatched from the LCC&apos;s above ground facility, which would be between ten and twenty miles distant. These teams generally consisted of two Air Policeman with automatic weapons.  These men having no training in the weapon system, no clearances and are the worst educated airmen on active duty.   However they are in constant radio contract with their dispatcher and through them with the MCCCs in the LCC, a hundred feet or so below ground and via patch with Job Control back on the base, about 100 miles, in this case to the WSW. These men reported seeing a &quot;fly saucer&quot; on the silo cover, inside the silo and smaller objects around it, that appeared to be lights &quot;floating&quot; in the air.  The larger saucer was sitting on the silo door, a massive 30 ton concret &quot;hatch,&quot; on a short rail track.  It was thus well  inside the fence and entirely unauthorized. As this was an armed and targeted missile, aimed at the Soviet Union, this flagrant breach of security was taken very seriously by all concerned. Minutes after these objects were spotted, the call came excitedly to our quarters, so I arrived within thirty minutes of the initial OZ security violation.  I actually arrived before the AP s arrived at the silo in question. By the time of my arrival, at JC, the JC Commander had taken it upon himself to send the nearest team, then at work on the missiles.   This team turned out to be about thirty or forty minutes away. Now this was entirely &quot;out of the book.&quot;  No open silo, as the one left was, was ever to be left without authorized personnel on it, since it would be launched. Nevertheless, the need to have a qualified observer at the site being probed by the UFOs, obviously overrode the Technical Orders of Operation. So the EMT team, that was nearby, was dispatched from their silo, which was under going some form of routine maintenance .  I believe this was an EMT team consisting of two Analysts and an Air Policeman. A Command decision, backed by SAC in Offitt AFB, lay behind this unusual order. Thus one AP and one Analyst were sent to the silo in question, leaving the open silo (and its deadly missile, in the hands of one man, hence the security breach). I remember not only overhearing the radio conversation as these Airmen approached the silo, a conversation that confirmed what the other AP s had seen, &quot;holly shit, there is a fuckin saucer on that silo...&quot;  but I talked with this man, a day or so later, myself.  He had been ordered to say nothing to anyone about what he saw.  But did confirm these orders and the facts as I knew them to be.  An Analyst, he, like me had spent an year in technical school, so we were close. During this same period, our helicopters were roused and dispatched.  Arriving as the UFO was rising up out of the silo.  They gave chase, but were unable to close, as the objects accelerated towards the NNE. The sightings continued for about a week with the same pattern.  First an Outer Zone beach and then an Inter Zone. We had no smaller aircraft, being a tanker and bomber wing, but evidently were able to call in a nearby KC-135 ( i.e., a 707 tanker) that must have been on &quot;rotation&quot; nearby.  I myself overheard the conversation between the pilots and &quot;base operations&quot; confirming the sighting of the or a UFO in the area.  Said UFO followed the KC 135 back towards the base, with a strong radar image, but no visual image. The plane was required to &quot;fly by&quot; so it could be observed and nothing was seen where the radar said something was. By this time the Base Commander and the Wing Commander, were in the area in staff cars.  I spoke briefly with the Wing Commander, who I knew well, Col. Burrell, that evening.   As the helicopters returned, with then was a photographer who had been rousted from his bunk.  He was loaded into the staff car and driven away under escort to the photo lab.  I did not speak with him, but clearly saw his photographic gear. I did not see these UFOs.  I did, however, speak directly with airmen who had seen them and indeed were seeing them. During that week there were numerous reports, so numerous that the Air Force announced that B-58 bombers were flying over on &quot;maneuvers.&quot;  But, of course, whatever landed on Hotel 6 wasn&apos;t a B-52. I am fully confident that during the summer of 1966 UFOs visited our Minuteman silos in the Dakotas, landed upon and penetrated those silos.  We were powerless to stop them and the USAF covered up this entire chapter. I suspect it is still classified and that I should not be talking about these events. I vaguely remember being instructed not to speak about these matters and was, of course, operating under very tight above Top Secret security clearances. I come forth because the missiles are non longer on active duty, the silos decommissioned and the time long past.  I can think of no reason why these events should be covered up in the name or color of national security. Something major happened that summer.  And it happened to nuclear weapon systems that were armed and on duty at the time.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Approaching Holgate street I spotted 3 brown cylinder shapes hovering over 4th avenue 800-900 feet in the air.  They were bronze and I could see the sun reflecting off the metal.   I took off my sun glasses for a better look and couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing.  I exclaimed to my passengers, &quot;Can you see that?&quot;  No one heard me.  There was one large one and two smaller ones trailing beside it and behind. The large one was rounded in front much like an overturned canoe would look. There were deep lines carved in it forming a design. It appeared to be made of a rich bronze like metal highlighted by the sun. I looked well ahead to see if they were being towed by an aircraft.  There was nothing, they just hovered and appeared to be moving very slowly like a blimp. I kept driving and then came up on the side of a building which blocked my view. As I cleared the building and got a clear shot of where they had been, they had disappeared.  It was really strange.The following day I drove back to the area I had seen them in. There wasn&apos;t anything there which would account for what I saw. The area they had been in were between Holgate and Lander street moving very slowly, west, over 4th avenue.", "Two disc-shape crafts over Denver, at dusk, resembling the recent Mexico UFO&apos;s, caught on a webcam snapI am in NC and was on the date in question.  However, while perusing webcams from Denver, Colorado on 5/6/04, I noticed odd lights in a webcam shot that seemed to be associated with two separate crafts, which were somehow lined up one behind the other.  The crafts appear to be disc-shaped.  They seem to be flying too close for airplanes.  This particular webcam shot is taken over the city of Denver, looking toward the west, but I do not have any more specifics.  It is from the TV station News 4 Colorado&apos;s webcam.  When I saw the odd lights, I saved the webcam snap.  At the time, I thought the lights were interesting enough, but since then, I find them even more compelling because now I think they strongly resemble the lights which were recently seen by so many in Mexico.", "Me and a friend saw a shpere shape craft lingering near the power lines and when we got closer it began to withdraw.The craft was about a meter wide and sphere shaped.

We then decided to look for the craft by car.  We must have driven around the area we saw it in for about half an hour, but we never saw it again.  I can definalty say that the craft moved in jerking movments side to side and up and down while heading in an eastern direction.  It didnt seem to move until we started to pursue it on foot and thats when it started moving away from us.  The craft seemed to be lingering close to the power lines in the ally of our nieghborhood.

The lights moved at a high speed, crossing from horizon to horizon in an estimated 6 seconds, straight and close to the zenith, many times faster than any aircraft or satellite that I have observed. The lights maintained their position relative to each other, but I couldn&apos;t see whether they were part of the same craft.  One light was behind and to the left of the other;  if one imagines a triangle moving point-first with lights on the leading point and on the leftmost point behind, with no light on the right, then one can get an idea of what I saw. The lights had an orange color similar to that of a sodium street lamp.  The sky was slightly hazy, and the haze appeared to be at a very high altitude, since a commercial jet observed a moment later appeared very clearly.  The lights of the unidentified object, on the other hand, looked as if they were above the haze.  No sound could be heard, though I listened for a long time (since the sound of fast-moving aircraft can seem to lag behind the image).

We were sitting in the living room of the home where I lived in Ballard, waiting for friends to come home.  I seem to recall that they had gone to a movie. Just minutes before they arrive back at the house, both I and my friend were shocked to hear some type of aerial object STREAK overhead, moving generally, we agreed, from southeast to northwest.  It was the (angular) velocity of the object, and the THOROUGHLY BIZARRE nature of the sound, that captured our attention immediately, and left us both stunned, and staring at one another in disbelief.  My friend, who admitted to me immediately after the incident that she had never believed in the possibility of UFO&rsquo;s, turned to me and stated that THAT object was a UFO!!  Her eyes were as big as tea cups as she said it, as she turned in my direction in a state of obvious shock and disbelief!  The sound that emanated from the object, in the opinion of both of us, consisted of two distinct, distinguishable sounds.  One sound was a very high-pitched whining, buzzing, or perhaps even screeching tone, not too dissimilar from the sound of a high-speed hydraulic pump, running at very high speed.  Another close equivalent to the high-pitched sound is the distinct &quot;buzzing&quot; sound that the human ear can detect from either a Boeing 747, or a DC-10, as it passes overhead at a high power setting.  To my ear, the sound I am trying to describe here has a slightly &quot;metallic&quot; quality to it, combined with the peculiar &quot;buzzing&quot; sound one might expect to hear from a bee hive, or from a large swarm of bees in flight. The other sound was a very low-pitched, &quot;deep&quot; rumbling sound.  In mirth, I often equate it to the bubbling sound one would hear from a very large cauldron at a slow boil with four missionaries being boiled down into a thick gravy.  Rather like a rapid &quot;blub, blub, blub.&quot;  I cannot emphasize enough with words how thoroughly bizarre, and unearthly, this sound was, and how it immediately commanded our attention.  We heard it, I estimate, for not more than TWO SECONDS, as it streaked overhead at what seemed to me to be almost directly above us. Now, the velocity of the source of the sound.  The object was moving at a stunning angular velocity overhead.  I estimate that the object making the sound passed through from 140 to 160 degrees of arc, again from southeast to northwest, in less than two seconds!!  This object could not have been any kind of terrestrial aircraft that I am aware of!  Given that there was absolutely no trace of the sound that would have been generated by a propeller, or from either the main- or tail-rotor of a helicopter, I conclude that the object could not have been either a fixed-wing or rotor-wing aircraft. As to my credentials, I have held a commercial pilot rating for over a quarter century (Flight Instructor for 10 years), and I have been around aircraft all my life.  My father worked in the airline industry for many decades, and I lived for a portion of my life with a family in the U. S. Air Force.  I know what aircraft sound like, and I know what they are capable of doing.  I cannot imagine that the object I heard on this particular Monday night could have been either built, or flown, by humans.((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by Peter B.

Resembled a flare.In April of 1995, I was in my house typing when I noticed a bright red fireball in the sky slowly heading north above the tree line above Hicks Rd.  My vantage point was from the east side of Hicks in my neighborhood, Reseda.  I initially thought it was a flare or a firework but I dismissed that notion quickly due to the fact that from my point of view, it was about the size of a marble and it was traveling in a straight horizontal line.  Although it looked exactly like a flare, the middle of the object clearly had a large amount of mass, which looked to be slightly ovular.  There was no discernable texture on the object, just bright red light.  After about eight seconds it disappeared behind the trees.  Later that year in October, I saw the object again traveling roughly the same speed at an altitude of about 200 ft.  It was heading west over Reseda.  This time I was outside on my friend&apos;s driveway waiting for my buddy to come out of the house and I got a good fifteen-second glimpse of it.  For a while, I believed it may have been ball lightning, but based on the altitude of the object and the size from my view it should have been about the size of a car or a truck, traveling at about 40 MPH.  Both times, the object appeared to be slowly hovering in a direct horizontal trajectory.  The object never appeared to be flaming nor did it leave a trail.  The object made no sound.  Incidentally, I have no witnesses to back me up on either of the accounts.  Though I can back it up with maps, drawings and similar pictures.

Back in 1997, my wife and I  were working out on our deck at our old place in Port Orford, Oregon. It was in July, and I can&apos;t find my old Diary to get an exact date but it was like the 12th or thereabouts. I&apos;d noticed a little twin turbo-prop with funny markrings: Parallel  red stripes on the wings. Also _I couldn&apos;t Identify the type!!_ it was a combination of Cessna/Beechcraft/ Piper Turboprops. (I&apos;ve flown or been around -all- of the  common types.) Also, there was no discernible registration number I&apos;d estimate the altitude to be no more than 2500 ft.agl. What was very curious, was the fact that it would fly over the coastline (ocean was 1/4 mile away and US 101 . Now this little Twin Turboprop hung around for hours, it was at low altitude, hardly efficiently using fuel. It was at least 4 hours in the Air over Port Orford, flying back and forth over the area. My wife looked up at the Little plane and said &quot;what&apos;s THAT?&quot; Here was a white &quot;football&quot; with a black stripe around the middle (about 2:00 pm)  and it was moving  north to south at about the same altitude as the Twin. Abruptly the Twin turned and was gone over the Treeline south following the &apos;Football&apos; the  Football appeared to be about 1/4 the size of the Twin. They  were quite close for a while about a wingspan (30-35 ft, ) apart. Then watching this ,high in the sky was a large cigar-shape heading west to east, no way to tell how high it was or how large. just well above this other show.I know it wasn&apos;t a large jet.-no wings or tail. my wife and I used our 8X50 binocs, on all of this, to no avial on detail just closer.

While reading a book I looked up at the clear sky sighting the moon. I then noticed a conical shaped object at an altitude of approximately 25,000 ft. It was stationary and the circumference had a constant solid glow- from the angle I was viewing it - it looked almost like the &quot;tick&quot; symbol  or &quot;nike&quot; logo. I watched it for several minutes unsure what it was then noticed that it shifting position where it leveled off to a horizontal position and could see that it was conical in shape and metalic coloured. I could clearly see a reflective metalic-like surface.  I asked several other guests if they could see the object which they could once I pointed out its direction. I then noticed a 747 pass behing the object which by my perspective made the object appear extremely large however I could not acurately scale it as I was unsure of the distance between the two object however the object was in the order of 20 times larger and I estimate between 5000 feet between it and the 747. By now all the pool guests were looking at the object and we watched it for atleast 10 minutes. I can tell you we were all transfixed and stunned. The object was so large and non-earth looking that we all seemed to be shocked into immobility and awe. We then noticed a warping or heat-wave like effect of the sky immediately behind the object and then it disappeared. We continued to scan the sky as we could not rationalise how the object had disappeared and were looking for it. I was in the USA for a conference and was totally coherent . I have never seen a ufo or had any real interest in such phenomena however I have a applied science degree and assure the reader this was not any optical phenomena.

Full Description of event/sighting: I saw an object as we were heading up Fraser Mountain in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia. Me and my one passenger on my left side were almost to the peak of the road when I noticed a large shining light to my left. I asked my passenger &quot;what the heck is that thing?&quot;. They responded with &quot;I don&apos;t know?&quot;.  We pulled over and viewed the object with two very bright lights, whiteish blue, flashing on an offset pattern horizontally from one another with no visible shape in the middle and flying very quickly and at a very low altitude coming towards us. It was at about 10:10 p.m. EST and was very clear and dark night with a few stars out. We turned around in a drive way and started to ascend down the mountain. I pulled over and looked back and the object was a minimum of 300 meters off the ground at the peak of the mountain hovering with both lights now staying on at the same time very brightly. We then drove away quickly to the bottom of the hill and turned right. This was 5 minutes into the viewing. I asked &quot;where is it?&quot; but it was nowhere in sight. Twenty seconds later as we were driving towards Melmerby Beach Road I saw the object again, both lights flashing offset again coming towards us at a very low altitude and quite rapidly. I have no idea how the object got from the top of the mountain to in front of us in that short amount of time and with such grace. I periodically asked my passenger &quot; are you seeing this?&quot;, &quot;do you believe this?&quot;. We turned into a road on the left to park to again view the object coming towards us it was getting larger and larger, the closer it came. Both lights were now flashing at the same time and both were still bluish white. This was viewed in a heavily populated residential area but no other vehicles or people were visible to us. It was about 1000 meters away now and I turned left to go down the Melmerby Road back towards Fraser Mountain. I looked back, the two lights now vertical from one another (one on top of the other with a space in between of darkness) as it the object went straight up in the air. The radio began to crackle at this time. This was about 8 minutes into the viewing. We took a right and were in downtown New Glasgow and then took another right and were on the road heading towards the power station in Trenton. This is about 10 minutes after we first saw the object, we both looked to our right in the sky and the object was now visible in the sky at a quite low altitude. Once again the blueish white lights were flashing offset they were horizontal from one another again with the shape in the middle not visible. As we drove down this road both me and the passenger rolled down our windows and there was no noise whatsoever. The object slowed to a halt, it flipped vertically so the lights were now one on top of one another and for the first time we saw a very smooth, grayscale shape in the middle not very wide at all, like a dumbbell. The object the fly away very quickly and that was the last we saw of it. The viewing ended at about 10:23 PM EST. Thank you to the witness for the report.

Except for the unusual pattern there was no other movement. &gt;There was also no other sound than the wind blowing thru the trees. These lights could not have been more than 300 feet off the ground.

In 1987 I was assighned to The United States Dept. of the Interior, B.L.M. at the Olancha Ca. This was a prototype Uni-Mog test,we were responsible for over one million acres. At approx. 22;30 we were dispatced from heatquarters in San Bernadino to a fire reported by a deputy sherrif, in the Panamont valley area, this I thought unuseual since a unit was available much closer than us. We responded, and on the highway to death Valley, Panmont Valley and to a small town called Darwen, in 15 minite of Traval time,at appox 60 mph we saw what I at first thought was a semi-truck on the left, we whre going east,just off the road. We did not have on the overhead lights since we were in the midle of nowhere and did not use lights and sirens in unpopulated areas. We slowed and stoped in the middle of the rd. We all saw a saucer, at least 60 feet wide,appox15 to 20 feet high, below the raise road bed, light up by a bright :bug light yellow interior light,showing through portholes across the upper area that was nearly even to the road,since it rested on the desert floor and not the raised highway. My engeneer became very frightend and rolled up into a fetal possition on the floor of the vehicle. He is a Georgia country boy, and not a small man at all. My Capt. who was driveing at the time looked catatonic, and simply said,&quot;Ive seen these before&quot;. I turned on the overhead rotaiting lights,the saucer turned off its lights. I tried to radio headquarters and the radio was dead. I left the engine and approched the saucer. I knew this was real and was very excited and interested,so I touched it with my hand, wearing a glove. The saucer rose up, no noise,lights out,and I could see it blocking out the stars, they were very bright. It rose to perhaps 30 feet,crossed directly over my head and landed just as it was before,just off the road and slightly b! elow it,  now instead of arms length away,30 to 40 feet away. At this time for the first time during this incident I felt fear instead of amazment. I thought something was trying to sneak up on me from behind out of the dark.

I understand the Navy took the wholle town of Darwen and leveled it, due to its closeness to the base. It was just a few gold miners their.I filed a report with the navy and was contacted by a rear Admeral who interveiwed me and kept asking me if I was aware they had a captured Russian gun ship, helicopter and that it was classified. He aked what I knew about helicopters, and when I informed him my duties requiered to fly offten, he said,&quot;with your knowladge of helicopters,what type would you say this was&quot; Fially I responded with&quot; I would say it is no type of helicopter I am familure with.

There were the usual satelitte sightings, a few meteors, and numerous airplanes.  Facing approximately due south, I noticed a satelitte about 45 degrees off the horizon, moving south-southeast. Another satellite traveling apparently in formation with the first appeared, and then a third appeared.  The three formed an elongated triangle and were very visible with the naked eye.  I did use my binoculars to track them however until they faded out one at a time, as most satelittes do.   At their brightest, they were about the same brightness as the stars of the Dipper - which is very visible overhead at this time of year. The shape of the triad did not change as they traversed the sky.   There were no blinking or strobing lights, and no sound. I am a private pilot and am familiar with aircraft.  The stars in between these points of light, we clearly visible; in other words, it was not a solid object. It is possible these were NOSS satelittes but I have not yet found corroborating info.  I might add that this is the 2nd time I have seen this apparent triad of satelittes in the night sky.   The last sighting was in Washington State a few years ago, from Mt.

It seemed that it should have disappered while in the cloud but we both could it see it brightly in the thick cloud.  It went backwards from the cloud and seemed to stay in one spot for a long time.  It always flashed the lights.  We got binoculars and could easily see red and green lights.  We tried to film it but was shaking badly but we did get it on our camcorder.  It was so far away like a star or an airplane in the sky however it was not an airplane or star that we have ever observed before.

My husband and I were returning home from dinner when he noticed these lights again.  This time they were very close to the ground - probably within a mile from us.  By the time he said &quot;There&apos;s those lights again!&quot; and I ducked to look thru the drivers side window, I saw 3 very large yellow/orange orbs with about 3 smaller lights around the outside of the larger ones.  From what I saw, they were in a triangular pattern.  However, my husband was able to see them better out the drivers window.  He said what he saw was 4 lights with the smaller lights on the outside of them.  He also saw a much larger light above these lights which appeared to be closer than the other 4.  The smaller 4 lights seemed to come on at the same time then the larger light came on.  When the larger light came on, the other 4 lights faded.  We were only a couple of miles from home.  We drove slowly trying to see them again but didn&apos;t.  When we pulled into our driveway, I got out of the vehicle as my husband was pulling it into the garage. I looked behind me just in time to see 3 large yellow orange lights in a horizantal line about 10-20 degrees above the horizon.  They came on from left to right and faded from left to right in a period of a few seconds.  We waited to see them again, but didn&apos;t see them again that night. As I&apos;ve stated before - this was the 3rd sighting in a years time in this same area.", "Redish erratic light over Bullhead City, AZ/Laughlin NV.At the said time and date, my wife and I were driving home. Almost nearly home, we noticed a fairly bright light on an object directly in front of us (North of our position.) At first, I dismissed it as a helicopter or a fixed wing airplane.Within 30 seconds of watching the object, what appeared to be the wing of the craft was illuminated by the bright singular light of the object. The &quot;wing&quot; appeared from our position that of an air plane in a hard bank. So the &quot;wing&quot; was straight up and down and was not hiding the large singular light, nor was it effecting the intensity of the light.At this time, my wife called her mother and had her look from her location which was only a few blocks away north of our position. Useless for triangulation. She attempted to get her video camera set up, but was unable to do so during the short time span.Gauging distance would be difficult, but I would guess it would be no more than 5 miles away. There was absolutely no sound.There was no wind whatsoever, yet the object looked as if it were drifting in a large circle, hung from a cable from high above. The object displayed no vertical movement. It appeared to keep the same altitude as it drifted to the West. At times it would stop making its pivoting circles, and hold in one location. From my position, it would appear as if the craft while drifting West would slow down, and head back East, then go back west. It would slow as it reached the edge of it&apos;s circular pivot.I&apos;ve used and seen many types of flares, and this was no flare. For one, if it was a flare, it didn&apos;t do a very good job at illuminating the ground. No smoke was seen near the object either. Plus, the lack of vertical movement makes me skeptical.I kept wanting to think it was a hot air balloon dangling a light below it. That&apos;s the speed and impression the object gave me.There were no strobe lights that I could see. The single light was much brighter than the evening star which was present just to the West. The light was a dim redish color that tended to flicker slightly. The size of the light from my position was aprox. 10 times larger than the Evening star.When the object disapeared, the light simply went out as if you flipped a switch. This alone eliminates any type of commercial traffic.My only theory is it could be ball lightning, some type of flare, unknown military or alien craft. We did have non-producing thunder storms in the area earlier in the day.I can&apos;t explain the cable or the &quot;wing&quot; structure above the light either. That kind of eliminates ball lightning.For me, I&apos;m a trained observer, and work security for the Federal Government at a local facility. I have an interest in aviation and military equipment.I&apos;ve never seen a &quot;UFO&quot; before, since I was always able to find a credible answer for whatever I saw.On a side note, during the event, it sounded as if a large number of people were outside looking at it. Also, I heard some tires screaching off in the distance. This object definately had peoples attention. We&apos;re used to low flying air craft up some fairly large commercial jets overhead since the International Laughlin Airport is aprox. 5 miles away.No other aircraft were present in the area during the event.You may contact me through e-mail if you need any more information.", "2nd of 3 Sightings from March 2003 to April 2004 - Yellow/Orange Lights in Formation2nd Sighting of 3 from March 2003 to April 2004.  This time we had witnesses!  We were watching the Full Lunar Eclipse in the front yard with our neighbors, their 2 children, our two children, my husbands parents and his aunt.  The lights first appeared to the left of the mood and almost completely to the east.  My husband and I recognized them immediately as the same lights we had seen in March.  The lights came on one at a time then went off in the same pattern they came on in.  About 5-10 minutes after they first appeared, they came on again further north.  They came on and went off in succession again.  Then a 3rd time they appeared as they had before, further north this time.  After the 3rd display, we thought we heard a sonic bomb and a military jet fly by at a very high speed. They appeared to be 30-40 degrees above the horizon and a few miles away.  They were yellow/orange.  Sometimes smaller lights came on around the main lights, sometimes they didn&apos;t.  They appeared to be moving north northwest.", "((NUFORC Note:  This report, in our opinion, reads as though it is a serious report.  However, it was sent to us on April 27th, and the witness to the alleged events indicates that the sighting occurred on the 28th of April.  This leads us to wonder whether it is a serious report.  To the best of our knowledge, an Air National Guard unit would not fly Grumman F-14 &quot;Tomcats,&quot; which are a jet flown by the U. S. Navy.  An ANG unit probably would fly F-16&apos;s or F-15&apos;s.  If there were other witnesses to this event, we would very much like to receive additional reports.

I stopped to watch them &apos;bank&apos; or make a tight right turn to get in position to land at the Des Moines Airport.-I watched the first F14, then the second, each came by about 20 seconds apart.-As I was wathching the 2nd F14 and looking closesely to see if their were weapons attached underneath the planes (they were very close and I could see the entire plane very clearly, something entered my site above the F14&apos;s that was extemely high in the sky.-The object started out as a small bright shining metal object because it was so high, that was all I could see.-I watched the object come directly down from the highest point in the sky to the 3rd F14 that had now entered my view right in front of me. He had started his bank or right turn and could also see under that F14.-Before the object was close the the F14 I could then see the shape of the object.-Description of object: Once it had descended close enough for me to see, I saw that it was bright, shiny metallic exactly like the metal &apos;mercury&apos;. It was shaped like a bullet when it was coming directly at me. It was approximately 1/2 the size of the F14.-It approached the 3rd F14 from the top, and turned sideways and this is when I saw it change shape. It changed from a bullet looking object to a round flat sphere. The rear was not rounded, but was straight. It was able to change like controlled mercury.-Immediately as it turned sideways it dove under the F14 and started what I call &apos;sniffing&apos; at the F14, or observing the underneath of the plane.-It was maintaing the same speed with the F14 as it went from the right wing, ducked under the F14 exhaust,engine and went to the left wing and continued the same observation on that side of the F14.-The 3rd F14 continued its extreme turn to head for the Des Moines Airport and the object then left the F14 turning left off of the left wing or heading west.-The object flew slowly at the same altitude approximately 500 feet and hovered.-The object then turned to face west, while hovering.-The object hovered after turning as if it was looking at something west, or behind me. I had a perfect view at this time of the object as it was approximately 1000 feet from me.-The object then turned north, while hovering, then flew at approximately a 75 degree angle upwards straight again to the highest point I could see in the sky at extremely high speeds, but still able to watch it leave our space. I would say it was like watching a F14 go almost straight up at full speed (which I have watched) and multiple that speed by 10.-The other or rest of the F14&apos;s made thier approach while I was watching the object leave.-20 seconds later 727 passenger jet came over my left shoulder at the same height of the F14&apos;s. That is what the object seemed to be looking at, but by the time the jet had gotten parellel with me, the object was out of view.-Witnesses: The pilots of the 727 had to see the object, it was right in front of them hovering. The 3rd F14 pilot had to see the object immediately when it was descended upon. It was also right in front of his windshield. The 4th F14 pilot was right behind the 3rd and had to see the object, no question. Myself as a witness.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Before going, we had a little chat. I looked up at him and suddenly noticed a black object which was hovering close by. I immediately saw it because I&apos;m a bird-watcher, I thought it was an eagle at first. Unfortunately I was shocked when I realized it was not a bird. It is an aircraft and a weird one which I never have witnessed before. I saw that it is a black disc-shaped object, so the first thing that came to my mind is that this is a UFO. I hoped that it was actually a flattened balloon slowly dropping down, but it wasn&apos;t. It floated at the same attitude going forward. I realized that it is nothing I ever seen. I quickly told my friend to look at it to see if he saw it or not, and whether he knew what the heck it was. He looked back at me after he watched for a while. I could see the same curious look on his face. He thought it was the so-called UFO too. We looked carefully at it as it slowly hovered, just like what helicopters does. I estimated it to be about 100 meters from ground and about the size of a car. As we are living on the 5th and 6th floor we should have heard a sound coming from it, if it had of been a helicopter at that altitude. The disc flew in a very unique way, it flew like something injured, because it sloped 45 degree to the left then right then left again as it traveled along. If it was flown by humans, they would easily be affected by nausea in such aircraft. I noticed a red light flashing at the back of the craft. Since it is still bright outside, I could barely tell whether it was glowing or not, but I saw the atmosphere near it was a little lighter than normal, maybe it is due to the contrast or maybe it is shimmering. It disappeared in the distance. We noticed that no one each from our hostel actually saw the object. I&apos;m still in shock and still try my best to understand what it was I saw!

A band of light wispy clouds were around it and to the left was a small patch of cumulus clouds there were being highly reflective from the moonlight.

I looked up to see in the clear detail a black V shaped craft travelling at tremendous speed suddenly halt just feet away from me. It had approx 10 white disks (not quite sure how many) that reminded me of satellite receiver dishes. They covered the whole of the underside. There were no glowing lights. It was completely silent. I saw this very clearly. It seemed to dart toward me and then suddenly darted away. I can licken its movements to a hummingbird. Then (and this is what makes me wonder if I hallucinated) I felt in a bit as a daze as i watched it transfixed (maybe due to shock) as it moved off at high speed and then it seemed to change direction and come at me but this felt more psychological than actual. I panicked and dived into the apartment completely scaring the wife. I came out again and it was gone. There was a gentleman on a balcony in an adjacent apartment who was positioned so that he &apos;could&apos; have seen somthing but he did not show any signs that he saw anything and I felt too embarrassed to ask.

We were headed west back toward the trucks as we drove over this little hill where we entered back into the wash. The lead guy Dennis stopped and waited on us. I thought this was funny cause most of the time they never stop for anything.(except beer) When the rest of us got to him he was waving his arms for us to stop to.We all stopped and saw two sets of lights just ahead of us over the wash above some corrals. It was flash back time for me..I told them to turn off their lights and motors.The lights were several thousand feet up I think. There they were again No noise, No nothing, motionless. These lights looked to be the same color as the ones we saw before. It was a full moon out and like daylight. I decided to drive closer with dennis behind me. we drove with the lights off real slow. the other guys waited not wanting to come..We had gone maybe a 1/4 mile when the lights went off.

After a few seconds of viewing the plane, I noticed a black &quot;dot&quot; in the sky above the plane. It danced around for a minute, and then disappeared. Before it disappeared, I snapped a few shots. Unfortunately the pictures came out pretty poorly, but I did manage to get a shot with plane and the dot in the view. I could see the object more clearly in person than what the photo reveals. It was perfectly round, and black, and moved in a darting fashion. At first I thought I was watching a balloon, but it moved too fast in too many directions, then zipped off to the south in a split second. I got one good usable picture, and would love to send it to you. I bought the camera/binoculars due to the high sighting frequency I have been having in this area. This is about the fourth sighting in the month of May for myself and my son. One evening about a week ago, we were awakened to a loud vibrating sound, which thought was an earthquake. When we ran out to the porch, we saw two lighted oval shaped objects steaking across the sky at unbelievable speeds. We also saw a UFO/craft flying over the Army Base in Dublin, CA that appeared to be shaped like an egg and was bright white.

We watched the object  pass directly overhead.There were no navigation lights. It was loud and sounded like somebody creasing a thick piece of one-ply cardboard. The craft was about 500ft up.It sounded like a jet, but not like any I had heard at multiple air shows I&apos;d seen in the past. We were members of a SAC unit that was a part of a GSU (geographically seperated unit) approx. 120 miles west of Omaha, NE. Our mission was in part support of SAC by operating a VLF transmitter site there.We both agreed that we did not see any exhaust or visible light from the craft. There was very little light in the upper clear sky as the moon was hidden by low partly cloudy cover.  About 15 min. after the sighting, I smelled something like jet exhaust that I have smelled before at airshows or on a flight line. On a note, the site we worked at had a radio tower, the height of which was a little higher than the Empire St. building in N.Y. This tower was surrounded by &quot;HAZ&quot; markers at the four sides of our 1/2 mile sq. site.  (HAZ was short for HAZARD and lighted at night) Our site covered 4 corners of four counties, not unlike the &quot;four corners&quot;.Years later and keeping in touch with my friend, I saw an airshow at Scott AFB, IL in 1991. The very same shape and sound was emitted by a craft that flew overhead: the F-117!

It is about a 15 min drive from Grimsby to Hamilton, and as my 2 friends chatted away, I kept watching this bright star.  It struck me funny as it seemed to be stationary, then go slightly lower in the sky and then up, and when it looked like it moved slightly north of the highway and then back to the other side, that&apos;s when I said, what the hell is that and my 2 friends noticed it.  I had been watching the light for a good 7-8 min before speaking aloud.  We all watched in silence for a couple a minuits as we neared the outskirts of Hamilton.  It was on the left side of my vehicle and the closer we got, the higher in the sky it seemed.  I then realized it was hovering way above the large chimney stack of a recycling plant about 3 blocks south of the highway.  the chimney is about 6 storeys high and on any given day, there is a wisp of smoke coming out and the winds grab right away and it changes direction almost as soon as it leaves the stack.  What I saw, was a huge column of smoke coming out, several times wider the the mouth of the chimney and going straight up, maybe 40 storeys and this light seemed mostly in the top part of the smoke which made it strangely reflective(like lights in a fog)on this clear night.  As we were now almost parallel with the chimney, I was pressing my face every couple of seconds against my window trying to look at this and it was now the thing was almost straight up(and I was still driving and could only glance every couple of seconds).

The funny thing is, I told my self that some construction company was building some huge structu! re behind this wall of smoke, beside the chimney, and that&apos;s where all these lights were coming from(but, there is no huge structure in the area and the chimney is the tallest thing). At that moment, the highway turns 90 degrees, and that was the last we saw of it.  One of my 2 friends saw 3 lights on top but what I remember the most was, when right beside it, looking at this incredible volume of smoke coming out of the chomney stack and hiding the entire bottom of this huge circular object but on the edges were all these different colors reflecting off the smoke and the smoke was rising thick and perfectly vertical at least 40 stories and, I had been watching this, light, for the entire time as it grew in size the closer we got.

I hope this helps, I can&apos;t think of anything more to add, but will update you if I do. Keep up the good work!  My many thanks to the witness for their report.

I at the time was testing my wings as an OTR truck driver. Partly because I made descent money for a twenty two year old, mostly because I was able to see many things I wasn&apos;t sure I would ever get to see otherwise. As a team driver at the time I typically drove at night, usually 9:00 pm to 5:00 am. Of course this was a great time to watch the sky as I often did. Strangely enough I was driving through Mississippi on a very sunny summer day. It was strange because; I never drove during the day and I was in a state I had been through only a handful of times in my short lived driving career. My driving partner at the time was sleeping and it was getting close to the end of my shift. Still very early in the morning I was driving north on I-55 heading home to Nashville, TN in a very desolate part of Mississippi, close to Durant, when I glanced up. There in the bright blue early afternoon sky I saw three very small dots sitting in a triangular formation. I say sitting because there was no movement whatsoever. The objects were so small I thought they must have been miles up. I continued to watch the objects as I drove up the interstate and they remained perfectly still in a right triangle configuration. I thought it was so odd because I had the thought that it could be a real sighting, but it was almost surreal. They seemed so far away and they were so small I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to think. I have no pictures to document what I saw but, if you saw three of the brightest stars in the night sky shining that brightly through the afternoon sun forming a perfect triangle, that&rsquo;s what it was. As opened minded as I am I had always been skeptical about the existence of e.t. life, but watching these objects made me really feel that there was something possibly alien or otherwise unknown hovering above me. My sighting went on for a total of about ten minutes. ! During the last few seconds of what was a very wonderful, but rather uneventful phenomena the objects suddenly moved straight up at a rate of speed I could not begin to judge. They literally disappeared in less than a blink of an eye, but I absolutely saw what appeared to be some type of mechanical movement something not at all natural. It was amazing and I so wished I had the opportunity to get pictures as I was driving. I had somewhat doubted the whole experience, but within about a minute of the objects disappearing the strangest thing happened. Five Air Force jets, and I&rsquo;m not sure what model, but fighter jets were doing flybys at and around the interstate. They circled within five miles of the interstate for a few minutes then disappeared. That incident certainly sparked my interest and belief that something possibly threatening and likely not human exists. Recently I was driving through a neighborhood close to home when I noticed a rainbow in the clouds. While observing the rainbow I shifted my sight about 45 degrees to the right when I noticed the same strange object. This encounter was much briefer and there was only one object I could see. My friend Keith was with me this time and I tried to get him to look, but when I looked to find it again, it was gone. I&rsquo;m certainly glad to know there is a website dedicated to discovering the truth about UFO&rsquo;s. I totally and whole heartedly believe that there is a lot we don&rsquo;t know, but I think we are on the verge of finding the answer to the age old question: Are we alone?((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "strange object seen , ball of flame at the tail enddistants to where i was sitting was a mile ,came from out of the tree thought it was a fire work going up in the sky couldnt have been a jet because there was no sound. had a ball of fire at the tail part could not make out what this was it moved across the sky and kept going till what seemed like a very far distance till it faded out, contacted kennedy space center to see if there were any launchings since i live here in florida but there were none scheduled. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))", "moch planemy sighting occured at night and at a distance so i did not see much detail just lights. i saw what i believed to be a jet or plane of some kind because of the pattern and color of the lights. one large white light with two smaller red lights on each side much like an air plane. what made my sighting wierd is that the plane stoped and seemed to hover making no sound, then the two red lights detached from the main light and seemed to make a controlled landing on the ground with each red light going its on way. i believe the two red lights were some sort of probes.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "The  bright  light stayed there for 5 minites than took off extermly  fast and vanished.As I was sitting in my backyard I was looking at the stars to the east of my position. I noticed what I thougt was one of the planets that has been in the sky lately. I was looking at it for roughly 5 minites tring to figure out which plant it was, it than moved very fast to the south and faded out of view. I tried to reason what it could have been and given the facts, that it was as bright as one of the planets that I&apos;ve been watching, staying in the same place for at least 5 minites, then taking off at a very high rate of speed there&apos;s no queston in my mind that it was a UFO. It was a extremly clear night here on the west coast in northern Californa.I could not make out a shape because of how high it was in the sky. I could only see the very bright white light.", "Five fire ball like lites disappearing and reappearing.  Digital zoom camera showed C shaped formation and even a silver shape formI was turning off the water in my garden, when I seen two lites far away looked as if they were signal flares.  I watched as one started to fade out, then reappeared on the far right moving up and down side to side.  Then another appeared just above the second and looked as if it split into two.  They would stay in one spot for around one minute and fade reappearing a second later on the far opposite side. I asked my wife to grab the video cam and digital cam.  I video taped several minutes of this and zoomed in with the digital cam and found they a C shaped in every picture taken.  In some pictures what looked to be lite colorful moons in the background and somthing silver in two other pictures.  In a couple of the pictures I included my boat to make sure the C shapes were not me moving the camera. Three Jets zipped thru the sky from Tampa in there direction and just before they got there the lites disappeared.  The jets turned around and headed back to Tampa. I&apos;m in my early 30&apos;s. Colledge grad in electronics.", "I saw a silent, diamond shaped craft with 5 lights on bottom, traveling slow.  The outline was fuzzy.........I was driving on a somewhat busy street, and noticed it on my left side thru the trees.  It was diamond shaped from what I could tell...the outline of the craft was faded and fuzzy, it sort of &quot;blended&quot; with the night sky in the backround. It had white 5 lights, 1 on each corner and one in the middle. I rolled down my window and didn&apos;t hear any plane. I was going about 45 mph, and had to speed up a bit to keep it to keep it in sight on my side. I estimate it was going about 60 mph....very slow for something as big as an average jet. I have lived next to a Navel Airbase my whole life, so I know all the aircraft flying around here pretty well.  This looked like NOTHING I&apos;ve seen before.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "Shiny box like object floats in sky.Object was a box shape. Very shiny exterior with what looked to be windows on the sides. Flying low (appox. 800-900ft). Moved fairly slow about halfway across my field of view, then sped up and vanished. When the object sped up, it made a relatively quiet (zooming) sound.  There was a slight green glow around the object. very strange. The stragest thing Ive ever seen in my life.", "Object that shoots off at a fast rate of speed across the sky nad video taped.(Looking towards Acton)  Another call came in from a fellow who again witnessed something that looked out of place in the sky and he also shot some footage of what he witnessed. The man and his wife had some family members over to their home. The witness had been telling his sisters boyfriend about what they saw on April 24, 2004. The witnesses sisters boyfriend looked out the window and commented, &quot;it wouldn&apos;t be the light on the tower over there?&quot;  The witness said, what tower !  The witness looked out the window and there again was something flying around the sky. There is no tower in the area where the sisters boyfriend was pointing out. This time the witness grabbed his video camera and started to take some footage. Now he admits that he is a ammeter photographer and just doing his best to get a shot of what they were observing in the sky. With the excitement of seeing something strange he admits there is shake when viewing the footage, but all of the family members who watched the film says it is very interesting to watch and the fellow still gets the shot. There was no multiple lights seen this time, only one object that shoots off at a fast rate of speed across the sky. The man who is filming this object, puts the camera down for a brief second as he was discussing what he was seeing with his sisters boyfriend. When he looked up again, the light/object was back where it originally was, or when the witness first saw it. Like the man said, it seemed impossible for something to move so quickly across the sky and return to the  spot from where it came from. When viewing the tape back at a slow speed the fellow says you can almost see the outline of the thing, the classic saucer shaped craft. Also still viewing the tape on the slow speed they tell me you can see a burst of  color, purple pinkish. We will see what the investigator who will be visiting the witnesses comes up with. Thank you to the witness for the report. One thing I would like to add. It was quick thinking that the witness thought to grab his video camera. I would suggest that folks keep a camera of some sort with them, or close by. One never knows when something like this will happen to them.

Not that it has been on my mind since then and have been wondering whether to come forward, it just hasn&apos;t been on my mind recently since it happened so long ago. I was young when it happened (6th grade) I believe it was during spring break (honestly can&apos;t remember though.) I was with my friend sitting on a hill directly infront of my house. We were just sitting there for fun and as we were sitting there we noticed a bright light streak across they sky at a very high angle, perhaps 70 degrees. Neither of us could tell whether it was in the atmosphere or in space. It seems very strange when I look back on the event but my friend started talking to it. &quot;If you are a UFO then streak to the left&quot; and it did so, causing a white streak from right to left. We could not, however, see it when it was stopped, only when it was moving. I was very frightened, but stayed. Eventually both of us were setting rules, &quot;you can pick us up but only if you bring us right back and to this time&quot; because I had seen the movie The Flight of the Navigator before. By the time we had set down the rules we said &quot;you can come and pick us up now&quot; or something along those lines. There was a vertical streak that came from way up in the sky which took less than a second to reach the ground. We couldn&apos;t tell whether it was a large craft that landed far away or a small craft that landed near by. At the time however, we believed it was a large craft that landed in the forest further infront of my house. Either way, both of us were so afraid we went to our homes. We had also mentioned that if they did not pick us up to burn the grass we were sitting on. The next day when we went to the same spot there was no burnt grass, but there was dried out grass everywhere. I honestly can&apos;t say that it wasn&apos;t there before though. I am now, by the way, 17 years old.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Flaming object, travelling slowly at low altitude on a horizontal path from north to south.I was 10 years old, but I remember this event vividly and knew it was something out of the ordinary. I was in my back yard with my younger brother, and I caught sight of a flaming object travelling low over the foothills west of town. I estimate now that it was about 30 to 35 degrees above ground level. It moved on a straight, horizontal path and did not emit any sound, like you would hear from a plane. I don&apos;t recall being able to make out the actual craft, but I watched this flaming tail (like you&apos;d see coming from a rocket in an old science fiction movie) slowly cross the sky from north to south until it was out of sight. It can&apos;t have been a meteor, because it was moving too slowly, and it remained on a horizontal trajectory rather than descending to earth.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "While looking into the night sky, I was hoping to catch a glimpse of the comet that was on the weather report, I was looking at the big dipper and noticed a bright  light, as bright as the stars around it and seemed to be as high, it was moving from south to north. I watched the light move in a straight line for about 8 seconds, then it disappeared for about 5 seconds and reappeared a short distance from the first sighting as though it was traveling at a constant velocity. It disappeared again and reappeared about 3 seconds later a short distance from the last appearance and going in the same direction only this time the white light got very bright and tunnel like as though a massive spotlight was shined in my direction. The spotlight effect lasted for about 3 seconds and then disappeared. After about 5 seconds I saw what looked like a comets tail in a redish orange and white mix (what was creating the tail was not visible) originating along the same line of motion as the lights but considerably farther north. This comet like tail made a large arc towards the ground and disappeared long before it would have hit the ground. It should be noted that when the light became a comet like tail, it accelerated to what I would estimate, based on seeing high altitude airlines flying at what I assume is 500 mph, to be moving at 4000+ mph. I think this may have been a decaying satelite but the white light especially the super white light with the tunnel effect has me wondering.", "Bright ball of light seen hovering over Phoenix.I was walking west down my street...looking towards Phx and noticing a jet leaving Sky Harbor Intl...not on normal course but flying a bit south and then west.  Then I notice a bright yellow/white ball of light...at first I thought it was just a planet.  But it appeared too bright.  I carry a small pair of 10x25 binoculars with me at all times when I take walks...just for this kind of thing....I focus into it closer...it had no blinking lights...just a yellow/white ball with edges that made it look like Saturn on a tilt.  It was moving slowly Northwesterly over Phoenix.  The trees were getting in my way and I run further north to see it getting dimmer.  At some points it would almost fade out then get brighter...and as it would dim it would change from a reddish glow to a blue/green glow then back up to full yellow/white.  I watched for approx 20 mins til it slowly moved out of view.  It was not a helicopter, blimp or plane!!  I walked home as fast as I could to make this report", "didnt seam to fly on air / had speed of lightMe and two friends, everyday when we got off the school bus ,would sneak and get into one of are parents car or truck and drive to a store that was close by to buy tobacco or cokes just fooling around,and that day I was on the passenger side just looking kinda at the sky as fare as I could see at the tree lines, and a black mantaray shaped craft came over the tree line and it just seamed to go, not fly and it done this about 40 feet off the ground kinda looked like it contoured want ever it went over as it came toward us it seamed to slow down,and it was about 20 feet when  we drove right under it and got a look at it from all sides,the craft made a humming sound and you could smell something like weeds burning,it had round port holes and the front looked like something you see on the stealth fighters,the underside was flat and seamed to have four grate looking squares,we never lost site of it for awhile and then all at ones it whent from maybe 500 feet off the ground to about 6,000 feet in about 2 seconds it seamed to hover there for about 3 seconds and then it whent at a 70 degree angle across the sky in a blink of a eye,that was 20 years ago and people we told thought we all were crazy,but to this day I have not seen anything like it.It did not fly it whent how ever it seamed to want to go kinda like it was in water just like a mantaray and it even looked like one. if their is anyone out there that has seen what we saw that day, you are not alone three boys from a small town, saw one too.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Canaveral is due north of here. Thanks.", "Light Blue &quot;boomerang&quot; shaped object hovered.The object was spotted east of Bakersfield towards the Tehachapi mountains.  The object was seen from far distance as a small mettalic like light blue object that shimmered in the light. The object hovered in the sky for several minutes without movement and slowely left from right several times and in and out of the clouds all for about 30 minutes.   We observed the object through binoculars and the craft appeared to be a dull baby blue color and the materieal seamed to be plastic like.  It almost seemed fake as if  the whole thing was an object from a cartoon or something.  Up close it was not mettalic at all, only at far distances did it seem this way.  At first glimpse the object was boomerang shaped.  Then throughout the 30 or so minutes the object slowly moved around and flipped over several times.   At second glance  the object seemed to flip slowely and at one instance the object seemed to be shaped like a large &quot;L&quot; on its side.  The object moved further into the sky until it was no longer noticeable.  The whole scene was surreal as if it we couldnt believe our eyes.  There was no condesation or anything left behind, however the object floated and was solid colored with no lights or anything.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "What appears to be a star, later a ball of light flew under it.I have seen numerous, red/white/green/yellow blinking, non-moving points of light for at least two years now, but I never gave them much thought, always passing them off as stars or planets. The following sighting begins with one such occurance. I work third shift, and when time allows I take a break and go to another building where I work to speak with a friend there. We usually talk outside while I smoke. On 4/18/04 I pointed out one of the above mentioned points of light to my coworker and we spent some time talking about it and what it could be, my coworker noted that it seemed to be pulsing (growing brighter and then darker) The object appeared to be just above the tree line (in what direction I do not know, I never was good at that sort of thing) but it was clearly in space, like any other star. I went back to my building passing it off once again as a planet or a bright star. Around four hours later I returned to my coworkers building for another break. To our suprise, while the rest of the night sky moved on as it does, the &quot;star&quot; was in the same place, as we talked we kept gazing at it, and both of us made note that it had move higher in a matter of seconds. My interest was peeked at this point, I continued to watch the &quot;star&quot; I also noted that it seemed to get brighter and dimmer with more frequency and intensity. The only movement it made was the moment it seemed to move upwards. As I watched the &quot;star&quot; directly under it and what seemed at the time just across the way a bright light flew directly under our &quot;star&quot; It was very bright and left a trail, I had a good 45 second view of it and it seemed to be round, and it left a slight, trail as it went, the trail was very close to the object. It passed out of my field of vision behind another building on the complex. Unfortunatly my coworker did not see the sphere of light. The sphere was certainly close, just behind the trees, it seemed to only be as high as a second story building. It was not a plane, there was no sound, no flashing lights, just a sphere of bright light. The next evening there was no sign of either the &quot;star&quot; or the sphere of light.Interestingly enough, the coworker mentioned to me the nxt evening on the phone that friends had called and talked about seeing a strange pulsing red star that did not move with the rest of the night sky. I am not sure if they are connected. Both happened in Maine, about 100 miles from each other. If anyone from Maine is reading this, it would be nice to know if anyone else either saw this, or has noticed the strange flashing stars that change color.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, or Sirius??

However, its movement revealed it to be perfectly round and then perfectly disc-shaped. Weather was sunny and clear, the sun often reflecting off its surface when the angle was right.

I wasn&apos;t going to submit this one, thinking it must be a satellite or something since I&apos;ve seen it twice now, but I see that this triangular light formation is becoming increasingly sighted and thought I would submit it because of that reason.  The circular lights were large and white (with possibly a faint yellow hue), flying in a perfect triangular formation. The lights did not blink, but were steady on. This time, there were two lights on the top row, and one on the bottom row, unlike last time when there were two on the bottom and one on top.  It was flying in the same direction as I reported last time, which was Southeast, but they were too far away for me to see if they were on some type of aircraft.  There was no noise.  I just watched them from my bedroom window (same one as last time), having just gone upstairs to get ready for bed.  Could this be a satellite? I can&apos;t otherwise explain how I would see the exact same thing going in the same direction, same speed, etc. from my bedroom window twice in 3 months.", "Bright-as-chrome object hoveringI was 9 years old outside playing when I noticed a quarter-sized oval hovering, very bright, so bright it looked like a piece of chrome. The day was sunny and no clouds were in sight. I stopped in my tracks and stared at the object for a few minutes, then for some reason got a chill down my spine and ran to get my mother and show her. The house was only feet from where I was standing, but by the time I returned with my mom, (only a minute or two), the object was gone. From then on I believed in Aliens.((NUFORC Note:  Date probably is approximate.  PD))", "Full Description of event/sighting: We did not see an object, therefore we do not know if it was a UFO experience, however the feeling was as such and the witness&apos; thought that it was some sort of &quot;supernatural/UFO&quot; sighting. At 9:00 pm a person sitting alone downstairs in the house was looking out the window, she saw, into the forest, two trees go in opposite directions, as if one went far to the right and the other far to the left. She did not tell anyone of this until the morning when we told her of our experience which happened at 3:30. At an undisclosed time of the evening the neighbor saw what she thought to be flashes out the back, (same direction), she thought we were taking pictures, we were not. She told us of this in the morning when I asked her if she had seen anything darning the night. At approximately 3:30 am four of us were sitting downstairs in the house. One of the ladies jumped and said &quot;did you see that?&quot;, one of the others said yes and they described that they had seen , as one going to the far right and one going to the far left, behind the trees that were &quot;splitting&quot; there was a very bright flash of light. About 10 minutes later one of the same two ladies jumped from her seat, started to cry and said &quot;what the heck was that?&quot;, the other lady had seen it too. They described what looked like a strobe light effect. The next day we found out about the other two experiences. I am submitting this sighting because of the fact that it was seen in three different time frames by three different &quot;groups&quot; of people, as well as the impact that it had on the two people that I was with was a very frightened reaction. I am hoping to find out if anyone else saw anything that night. Thank you to the witness for the report.

We were talking and I looked up in the sky and I saw an airplane. The weird thing was that there was another flying object flying perfectly right beside the airplane. I mean it was going at the same exact speed that the airplane was, without moving or turning or anything. The unknown object beside the airplane looked as though it was larger than the airplane and it had a very bright glow to it. But the oddest thing about the object was that, unlike the airplane, it looked as though it was floating through the air and there was no smoke cloud left behind it like all flying aircrafts make when theyre being flown. Which leads me to believe that this was a supernatural occurence and that it was a UFO. After about 4 or 5 minutes the object and the airplane got so far away that they werent visible to us any longer. I wonder if anyone in that plane saw anything during their flight and if their were any reports? It was so high up, I couldnt tell what shape it was.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was taking my morning break to have a cup of tea and sat on a chair by the window in the teachers room.  I noticed something that seemed to be drifting past the window (the school sits on a hill overlooking the city).  It was about 150 feet away. At first I thought it was a para sail,  but when I looked closely, I realized it was something that looked like three stuffed pillows stacked one on top of the other.  There were cables or wires that held a dark canister hanging beneath it  and seemed to be suspended from the sructure. There was a teacher in the room with me, and I directed her attention to the object.  She went to the window where I was standing and watched without comment.  I thought the whole incident was very strange.  The object drifted, rising and falling with the general contour of the hillside until it passed out of site.  I don&apos;t know why, but I had the feeling that it was gathering information, collecting data of some kind.  It seemed to be under control and climed in elevation when necessary.

I remember some object directly behind the lights that left me with the impression that the lights were attached to it.

We do not know what she saw.  PD))", "String of star-like lights drift through sky in straight line, with equal distance apart from one another.Actually this night I had two UFO encounters. The first was very insignificant but it was because of this first one that I later noticed the more prominent one. 1st sighting: I was driving south on Hwy 97 in Bend, from the Holiday Inn. I hadn&apos;t quite reached Cooley Rd yet, but was coming up on it fast. It was about 9:00 pm, only a half hour or so before my second sighting. I saw this dark object &quot;fly&quot; over the road from west to east. I noticed it because it reflected light on it&apos;s underside. I saw it for perhaps a second. It then stopped reflecting light whereupon I could no longer see it. If I had to surmise how big the object was, in my best guess it was small; perhaps as big as a large duck. I also believe that it was very low to the ground, around 100 feet no higher. The shape was nearly indiscernable. It would be pointless to describe it. 2nd sighting: I was driving north off Glacier Ridge and came to the stop sign where you turn onto Neff rd. I was looking in the night sky for more stuff because of my first sighting. I noticed a bright light in the sky. I thought it looked funny, but not suspicious. I watched it at the stop sign until I noticed it had a blinking light. It then started to move to the west where I then realized this must be Air Life. I rolled down my window and heard the blades of a helicopter which more or less confirmed my suspicions. I then turned onto Neff Rd heading west and continued to look in the same patch of sky (looking true north), when I became aware of a strange assortment of stars. There was quite a few of them all in straight line. I knew this was more than a coincidence so I pulled my car over to the side of the road and got out to take a look. And I did for five minutes. This is what I saw. There were 12 of these lights. They appeared just like normal stars. Equal in size, and luminicity. If they weren&apos;t in a straight line I would have never known the better. The first light closest to me was directly above me. Straight up in the sky. Then the next one was a little to the north, and the next one the same distance to the north as well. It appeared from my angle as if they were all spaced equally apart from each other, except that the distance they covered shortened the length for the ones farthest to the north. I noticed that the lights were moving ever so slowly. At first they appeared to be moving north, but after a while I noticed their greatest motion was from east to west. They all moved together to maintain this straight line. On a couple occasions I couldn&apos;t count 12 but only 10 but that&apos;s probably because they were hazed over by the city light of Bend. On two occasions it also appeared as if the lights all would wobble together. Meaning all of them would seem to wobble in place, and I believe all of them did this at the same time, however it was hard to discern without any reference for a plane of stability in the sky. It might have been only the one light moved from more or less directly north of me, to the northwest of my vision, and were ever so slowly moving north as well. The one light that used to be directly overhead was now further north. So I got back in my car and drove no less than a quarter of a mile.. keeping an eye on these lights outside my passenger window. When the oddest thing happened. I passed them! I pulled over again and got out to take a look. And I noticed the lights were roughly in the same place in relation to me, as I was in my original spot after first spotting them! I had somehow passed them in less than a 1/4 of a mile! When I was driving I saw myself passing them up! Now before seeing this, my guess was that these lights that looked a lot like stars, were pretty high up in the sky. But after realizing I had passed them up in my car in such a small distance, they had to be really low to the ground. Perhaps 500 feet, maybe a little more. And they must have been small too... It&apos;s hard to say, but maybe the size of a kite. Now I didn&apos;t watch them long after the second time I pulled over, but I just left after taking my fill. I tried really hard to be objective about this. No lost time. No noises were eminating from these lights. What little wind there was, was blowing from the west and sometimes the north. I find it very hard to think that this could have been some weird person&apos;s idea of attaching lights to a kite, and attempting to fly it with little to no wind, in the middle of the night! And somehow making them drift across the sky in formation! Usually a kite rotates from the anchor, and these lights did not do that!  The other interesting thing to note is that my mother said, according to the news station the military was testing jet craft or the like during the night time this last week. I heard such a craft around noon a week prior to this alleged news briefing. Now if this is military related, it must be small remote control craft. I would be very hard pressed to imagine something else. Whatever it was, these two sightings were small, which is a theme. Although one did not emit light, the other string of objects did.. I can&apos;t think of more than that. The lights seemed like natural star light. Remember Air Life (I assume it was Airlife because the hospital was a half mile away!) was nearby before I noticed the lights. They may have been there before, but I never noticed. Oh one last thing... It was a beautiful day in Central Oregon, so there was not a cloud in the sky, and ditto for the night as well.  I feel that it&apos;s pertinent to my UFO sightings to mention my mood. I have witnessed 5 UFO&apos;s, and I mean that in the most literal sense. I don&apos;t assume they were alien craft, military, or whatever. They are just Unidentified Objects manuevering in the sky. But on four of these sightings I remember my mood to be in the range of happy, and usually full of energy. More or less just feeling good about myself. The other UFO sighting of mine happened much earlier in my life (9 years old) and I can&apos;t recall my mood, but I was with a lot of friends, so I suspect it to be in the &quot;feeling good&quot; range. Okay I have just proofread this and remember one last thing although I feel it&apos;s unrelated to the incident, and makes me feel a little more than embaressed. But when I first saw the Air Life helicopter, I tried flashing it with my headlights on my car. I was flashing them with my &quot;brights&quot; pretty rapidly, comparable to morse code. They copter was in the perfect position to see me, so I thought I might get a response from it. I did not.", "Little white dot visible very high in the daylight skyI was laying back on the grass at Zuanich Point in Bellingham, WA. We (me and my husband) were looking at a plane flying by, when I saw a little white dot way up in the sky. It seemed to be stationary, and it was too high to be a bird, or plane, or cloud. It was very tiny, just a little white dot. About the size of this period . to my eyes. It was visible for about 10-15 minutes, and all the while I was trying to point it out to my husband. However, it was hard to see unless you happened upon it, like I did. I looked away a few times, and was able to find it again. After awhile, I looked away, and then tried to find it again and couldn&apos;t find it again.", "Did anyone else see what we saw in Downtown Los Angeles?I was driving back from Monterey Park on the 101 North when my girlfriend and I saw 4 bright lights hovering in position right in the heart of downtown Los Angeles.  As we got closer, I thought to myself that it&apos;s strange to see an object not move at all that didn&apos;t resemble a human aircraft but kept quiet, it wasn&apos;t until my girlfriend mentioned the word UFO that I really became intrigued.  We kept looking until we had to drive behind buildings.", "a late summer afternoon in a suburban neighborhood on a very clear day, with a moderate breeze blowing from the west.  I looked up to watch the Ozark flight come over the house.  Directly behind it was a strange, metallic object flying at least as fast as the plane.  There were approximately 10 neighbors outdoors at the time, engaged in gardening, playing with kids, berbecuing, etc. When the object was seen, all stopped what they were doing and came to watch. It had stopped and was hovering over an apple orchard that was maybe three blocks south of the neighborhood.  It was  a saucer-shape, definitely metallic and had a copperish or bronze sheen to it.  The size is hard to determine, but it must have been at least a large as a 1960&apos;s car, given the distance from which we were seeing it and the detail we could see.  It definitely had port holes, or circles near the mid-section. It rotated around as it hovered. It was totally silent, there was no noise when it entered the area, hovered and left the area.  Everyone was dumbfounded and stood together for quite a while. Finally, someone shouted he needed his binoculars and another one said he had a camera with film.  As the men began leaving the group, the object then rose into higher and accelerated rapidly away, leaving in a westerly direction, against the winds and disappeared in the distance.  Everyone was stunned by the event and we children were warned not to mention it to anyone. No report was ever made of this for fear that the reputations of the observers would be damaged.  Those who were there included an insurance agent, a regional sales representative, an employee of the USDA, a vice-president of a small factory, housewives and children of varying ages. All were totally sober and unimpaired at the time. I was about 14 at the time and my brother was 8.  He also remembers the incident well.", "UFO &quot;cigar&quot; crosses immense Texas skyWe were on the highway going west. Big empty sky. I was driving our motorhome westbound and the sun was behind us. It could possibly have been a bit before one PM. I noticed a cigar shape in the southern sky going north. It was at 10 O&apos;clock and very distant. It caught my eye as it was extremely far away as big as a city moving in a straight line without any contrail. It would seem it was above our stratisphere. My husband had worked on the space program and was aware of more possibilities than I, as to the distance and size. We were estimating by going against the flat surface of earth, distant mountains and such. I pulled off the highway as quickly as I could and we, including our four children, watched it cross the sky. It was amazing. To get an idea of its size to our eye, it was the length of the breath of my fingernail and as thick as my short nail, a grain of rice!!! In a clear sky moving as fast as it was, was a UFO as nothing made by us could achieve the speed in which this moved at that distance.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Irritating sounds from a low flying objectI heard a sound like a transformer sound. It became irritating enough to wake me. I look out my back window facing north. I notised what looked like a large almost triangle like object above the trees moving at a really slow speed. No lights on it just a grey looking object. It moved from a north headed to south east direction. The transformer sound did get loud enough to cover your ears. You could hear what sounded like pleaty of electricty passing threw it. I would guess the speed to be about 5 mph.", "An object comprised of 4 or 5 metalic orbs in a row, moving West to East, and returning every 5 minutes following a parallel path.A friend and I were walking through a park in the early evening of May, 1983.  We were both 17 year old high school students, and just strolling and talking together on a warm, clear evening.  As it got dark we laid on the grass to watch the stars. We saw an object moving from West to East --- seeming to be at a similar altitude but faster speed than a commercial aircraft.  However, it was visible against a starry sky, seemed larger than a jet, and it had an obviously different shape.  The object was comprised of 4 or 5 metallic balls connected in a straight line, front to back. What really caught my attention was the fact that it would move across the sky from our left to our right and disappear over the right horizon, only to return in five minutes or so from the left horizon again --- but higher in the sky.  This happened maybe four times --- each pass starting higher in the sky.  It gave the impression of the object possibly mapping the earth.  And the fact that it always went left to right started my friend and me on a discussion of the possibility of there being more than one craft versus one craft circling the globe at an incredible speed. This sighting took place in an extremely quiet, rural town of 7,000 people.  If a jet came overhead or a truck passed on the interstate on a quiet night you would hear it.  This object made no noise.  There was also very little light polution in our location. I have never heard another account of a craft shaped like this one --- several orbs in a row.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Huge Saucer with lights seen, over Oak Ridge, hovered, lights changed, and suddingly disappeared .Occurred during the time of my wife&apos;s birthday, when I was consulting for a Contractor at Oak Ridge.  While at the Y12 facility, after dusk, one of the employees after coming from his car saw a craft approaching the facility from another facility on that Government Campus.  He rushed in and told us to grab any cameras, and come out and see something spectacular.  Five were able to obtain cameras,  and approximately 40 to 50 employees, including guards saw the saucer.  It hovered almost over the Y12 facility for over 20 minutes.  It changed colors from time to time, and emitted light beams.  We five took many pictures from the basically same vantage point.  The Craft was much larger than a B2 Bomber!  It was estimated to be at least 400 meters from us for a time.  MUFON members were told about the incident, but they wanted pictures from daytime shots of a classified facility - which obviously are not allowed by the Government!  Since the film had to be turned over to the Contractor, and the Government,  the original negatives and slides are their property.  Afterward, some of the prints of pictures, and some slides, that were taken in the dark, which didn&apos;t reveal any clasified secrets were returned to the respective photographers.  When the FBI was questioned about the nature of the object,  they said they couldn&apos;t answer about the nature of the craft - &quot;since it was highly classified!&quot;.    Copies of some of these pictures were given to a book vendor at the 1992 or 1993 Eureka Springs UFO Conference, in exchange for some Bible UFO related books.  Also at the time, myself and an FBI Agent gave some of the pictures of &quot;Ball Lightning&quot; that I had taken over my farm north of Willow Springs, Missouri.  We asked the vendor, what he thought of the various pictures, and what he thought they were, and what he thought was their origin?  Pictures have been recently furnished to people at Laughlin UFO Conferences,  to ((e-address deleted)), The Museum of the Unexplained, and others inspite of some of the! m being published (1998)in &quot;Pleiadians from Alcyone&quot;.  (The pictures on pages 1 and 2 are  of the craft over Oak Ridge - which is not near Nashville, Tenn. but are of &quot;Ball Lightning&quot; north over our farm !).  ( The Pictures on pages 3 through 11, are some 35 mm slide pictures that I took, along with pictures that a Contractor Employee took with his poloroid camera, and two pictures were taken by another employee with a press type camera!)  By-the-way,  those pictures belong to the Gov&apos;t/Contractor/ and the employees were given permission to share them as they saw fit!  When one reads the referenced book, pages 12 through 27, they are interesting, informative, and make an interesting tale.  Is there a coincidence here with another similar sighting?   The bit about the photographer is very interesting.  I know nothing specific about Teygeta or Zeta-Reticuli-I, Alpha Centuri, Pleiadian Alcyone crafts!  So I did not create that story.   So what is the truth, it has to be scientifically investigated, and tbd.  I can only stay with facts as I understand them.  At the near end of the hovering of this spectacular, well defined, colorful craft;  the craft lowered a portion with different lights, like from some type of antigravitics/ superconductive propulsion unit (that is attributed to be the opinion of some so called observers?),  and then the craft slowly rose, headed off in a northerly direction, sped up and suddenly (without sound), and &quot;like a bat out of hell&quot; lifted up vertically, rose speedily out of sight and disappeared.  Was this experience a projection or a Hologram, I believe not so because of the definition in the shots taken by the various cameras!    greetings- fj/bf", "7 people see lights in triangle formation move across sky.Forth of July holiday, my brother had a party at his house. Was actually pretty mellow. Kids were all in the house,asleep or watching a movie.

It looked as though it was stationary as the clouds were slowly moving East.  My first thought was it was a runaway balloon.  But when it was not moving with the wind...it had to be something else.  Then without warning and with no sound at all, it took off in a straight line...it&apos;s tragectory North to South at a slight incline.  The velocity was phenominal.  It went through the cumulous clouds and passed over my house.  No vapor, no sound, very fast.  If I were to guess it&apos;s size...I might have to say around the size of a Volkswagen Beetle.  That&apos;s my story...that&apos;s the truth...take it or leave it.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "Mysterious light over Winslow,AZ  unsuccessfully trying to pose as a star.I was driving west on i40 when a bright star started to bother me. It seemed bright but at times went dim.  I thought it was just a bright star at first but then it got a lot bigger, it didnt appear to be an airplane, there was only one light and it wasn&apos;t blinking like planes do. I reached down and got my flashlight and flashed the object thru the front window while driving- the object became bright and dim like a response.  I felt like it was watching me so I pulled into the Pilot TS in Winslow,AZ and parked.  I went out to the outskirts of the parking lot/near the edge of the desert {NW corner} and watched the light.  It was hard to determine the size or distance-it was about 3 thumbs up from the horizon. I got scared and went into the ts. I came out about 20 min later.  went to the same spot and the object seemed to be at a distance toward Flagstaff.  It was 1 thumb from the horizon if even that.  I went over and got another driver and told him about what i saw and where i saw it and showed him the light, just as he looked at it, the light flashed bright again.  He confirmed that it was to bright to be a star.  The reason i didn&apos;t believe it was a star was because when I was driving I noticed it move; it was south and i saw it move from the southwest part of the highway to right in front of me.  It went about 2 horizontal thumbs within about 5 to 6 seconds at a hight of about 21/2 thumbs high.  It could have been picking up my CD radio frequency (iroc) that i was playing over the radio.  Needless to say, I didnt have a warm fuzzy feeling about these guys. I thought it pretty ironic when i later turned on the xm and heard you on coast discussing ufo siteings the very night i encountered one (for the first time).((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at Venus.

Broad daylight.A couple of people laying down on tables pointed out a couple of circular objects in the sky almost directly above us.  They seemed to be very high up.  No detail visible, just white circles.  They were about the size of Venus at night quite recently except this was broad daylight and they were not shining.  They were moving east, or towards the &quot;white&quot; of the sky, all the while maintaining the same distance between them, until we could no longer see them.Two more (or the same, unsure) then showed up.  Similar distance from each other but not moving.  A third one appears, moving really quickly towards the two from the left.  It passes them and slows down, seemingly forming an equilateral triangle.A plane flew by, what seemed to be below these objects (the detail was much greater on the plane).Lost sight of them.  And then only one is visible at a lower point, off to the east, close to the &apos;white&apos; part of the sky.we speculated on weather balloons until this other one was seen moving so quickly.  But we really came to no conclusions.", "Triangle craft with 3 white lights, 4th flashing, as I filmed the craft it made no noise, hopefully you will see on TVComing out of the house last night, down the driveway to get something out of the truck, my right eye quickly caught a light, or lights off to the right. I looked up, saw some lights, it was a craft of some kind, so I quickly thought to myself, then grabbed my camcorder that happened to be on my front seat,inside the truck. From this point on I have on video, its not the best, I tried to zoom in and out, and the camera didnt like that in darkness. But it will be worth the wait, if I am still alive. :-)  Its 8pm, and total darkness, a couple of street lights in yellow, the moon has not come up yet, when it does its a full moon. I look and see this craft has 3 lights, one in the center flashing, its a triangle shape and coming towards me over the homes, I follow it with the camera until it gets to the end of the street. Once it got to the end, I noticed at the end of the street another of its kind was coming the opposite way traveling towards us, the two met at the end of the street. This other craft was flashing a white light and had stationary lights surrounding it just like the one I saw up close. I got into my truck to go look for them, but they had gone, so I thought. I took a left onto the other road, and shortly turned back. As I turned right back onto my street, I looked over to the left, and above the old town pool and park area, I saw both both of them, hovering, semi, almost fully cloked. I dont know how to spell cloked term from Star Trek so I am typing &quot;cloked&quot;. Hopefully someone can let me know the correct spelling. As they were hovering the other caught my eye, the other wasnt all the way cloked, its hard to explain, but to the right of the craft, it was lit up, just a little, its lights were lower, then stronger, it was doing something while the other stayed stationary to its left. finally the light went out, and both of them were straight ahead looking at me, cloked, each of the craft had one little light at each end, as if it was  a distant star far off, the lights were on each side, with a certain distance apart, the other craft had the same lights barely visable, only this second craft hovered just a little distance from the other. It getting real cold, so I talked out loud to these things, because at this point I am wondering if I made this whole thing up in my head!, as I am leaving, the one on the left crossed over to the right, then towards me, as I turn around and go towards my truck, it starts to follow on my right and contunes to move as I am walking, I get inside my truck as it leaves, still cloked. I have to record this for myself, but I should describe what I saw, because you cant see the video yet. This craft that I filmed was a smaller craft, a little smaller than a small airplane, it had three lights, one in the center, the 4th, was flashing also a white light, and it seemed, well once you see the video, it seemed that the flashing light was also being beamed out towards the other side. The craft went at a good pace, it traveled with one light as a leading part of the craft while the other two lights were on the sides. There was no sound, I was ruffly 35 yards away. Just across the street. In the video, it goes behind telephone poles, wires from cable and phone lines. This craft then met up with another that was coming from the opposite side towards it. I hope this was clear, any other info I can add if you need. Once I copyright the video, you will see exactly what I saw. Hopefully someone wont come and kill me for the tape in the meantime.

We spotted this hugh light in the southwest sky.  Being curious as to what it was, we watched it for 10 to 15 seconds and it just hung in the sky.  There was an airplane up in the sky well above this light and we could see a very short con trail.  As we continued to watch the light our view was blocked by trees in the area.  When we walked farther we could again spot the object.  It just seemed to hoover in the same place.  I don&apos;t believe it moved up or down or side to side.  We again came to an area where we couldn&apos;t see the object, and when our view was again clear to see it, it was gone.  my best opinion of the time was that we had it in view approximately 1 minute.  I tuned in to Art Bell that evening after we had seen it, and it was either that night or the next that he told of a pilot comming from Minnesota that had seen a large light while he was flying his airplane.

I was a graduate student in neurobiology at the time and my mother had come to visit me at my apartment for a few days (she is a teacher). One evening, around eleven o&apos;clock, we were standing on my balcony looking up at the stars before retiring to bed.  My apartment balcony faced southwest, and it was a very clear summer night.  We were standing by the railing, engaged in conversation while just enjoying the view.  As I was looking around, I noticed a what first looked like a star moving in a straight line from southwest to northeast (it seems to be moving in a direction that would eventually pass directly overhead).  I then noticed another point of light very close to it.  When I first noticed the two lights, they were at around a 50 degree angle to the horizon and were approximately thumbs width apart.  I pointed them out to my mother.  At this time I assumed they were satellites. I have seen satellites many times before and these appeared like them.  They were moving slightly faster than other satellites I have observed however.  As they moved closer to being almost directly overhead, they suddenly did something no satellite would do.  Both lights began moving in a completely erratic manner.  They slowed, then began forming loops in the sky, weaving to and fro and forming circles and zig-zagging manouvers with smooth precision.  We continued to watch until they passed out of our sight beyond the roof of the apartment building directly overhead.  At this point my mother and I both looked at each other and didn&apos;t even need to speak.  But when we did, we both wondered what in the world we had just seen.  They seemed the brightness of a star or satellite, but moved in a completely different way.  There was no sound, no colour change (the lights were pinkish).  They were very high up, they were not insects, birds, airplanes or helicopters. I have been interested in astronomy for years, have taken several university courses on the subject, and I have observed comets, meteor showers and even a fireball or two.  What my mother and I saw that night neither of us could explain, and we still wonder about it to this day.  I was listening to Coast to Coast AM last night and heard Mr. Davenport implore people to report their sightings, so I am doing so now.

Our neighborhood is rather rural. The event we witnessed appeared in the lower southern sky (about 30 degrees from the horizon) at about sunset, traveling very quickly east to west, silent and very bright. It could be described as a streak of light with a sparkly tail and disappeared behind low clouds or vanished after viewing for perhaps only 5 seconds.", "after making incredible aerial manuevers, the object merged with 2 other objects and sped offWe were traveling south on a country road towards Kennett Square.  There were 4 or 5 of us in the car.  It was a dark, clear night.  We noticed several cars parked on the side of the road, people looking at something in the western sky.  We stopped and I wondered what the big deal was about the light in the sky.  Looked like a plane or a copter to me.  They told me to keep watching.  The object was about 50 degrees above the horizon, moving in a southeastern direction.  As it got closer, I noticed that the light seemed to change to red and back to white.  It made a right angle turn and went higher in the sky.  No noise, no hesitation.  It made several 90 degree turns, in the meantime traveling southeast to northwest and back again.  The object could also completely reverse direction.  It traveled fast.  It went to the northwest and at that point we noticed there were 2 more objects -one from the southwest, one from the northwest that seemed to be descending on the object we were watching.  They all seemed to merge and after a couple seconds, the object sped off to the northwest at a 75 degree angle and disappear.Several cars had stopped and gone,  so I know there were quite a few that saw the event.  However, those that stayed to the end all agreed -Nobody saw a thing.I guess they are still keeping silent.I may be sketchy on the dates and time, but I know what I saw.  I will never forget it.  Incidentally, the driver of the car in which I was riding broke the speed limits going back home.  But he didn&apos;t see anything, either.

The witness was backing into her carport when she spotted the object and started yelling at her daughter who was with her to look towards the mountains. Her daughter looked in the wrong direction and missed seeing it. She said the back of the object looked like it was flared out. As she observed the object move across the sky it would fade in and out. Also she noticed when stated to fade she saw a red puff come off of it. I asked what she meant by a &quot;red puff&quot;. She really found it hard to explain and said it was a red something, like a burst of red. Every time the object gave off the puff of red the object itself became more visible, or a bright white in color. There was no contrail left by the object. It was flying from the north heading to the south in a straight line. I asked if she was able to give me a rough idea as to the size of the craft. The witness said it had to be longer than the length of her arm. The lady said it was traveling at a very low altitude, between the mountains and her residence, but extremely low. She also said there is a small airport close to where she resides. I wondered if a plane was coming into to land or one might have been taking off. But from the sounds of what the lady saw it doesn&apos;t seem to resemble an aircraft I am aware of, but of course hard to say. There was no sound heard, but another interesting point she made was that her pets (dogs) and the neighbors dogs were acting up all night long. (only this one night when the sighting took place) The lady said this is certainly out of the norm for them to carry on like this and she thought this was unusual. It was interesting to note that on the weekend the local Airforce Base there was a aircraft fair taking place she told me and this was after her sighting. Thank you to the witness for the report.

It was dark and appeared triangular shaped. As we were returning from the north, we looked at the water tower and the object was gone. Just at that moment I looked back toward the north, and coming straight toward us at an altitude of 100-200 feet was a triangular shaped object. I would guess that each side of the triangle was about 50 feet, and that the object was traveling about 20mph. It passed directly overhead, and what was spectacular about it is that we cut the engine, and there was no sound from the object. Secondly, all around the edges were red, white and blue lights, pulsating intensely. We watched it as it slowly moved out of sight to the south. When we got back to the marina, we walked out on a dock to watch the sky. Lo and behold, we looked west toward the Dallas skyline and saw three of these objects sitting still in the sky in a triangular formation. Angle was about 25%.

It was traveling very slowely.  When it passed Kings Mountain, and was in the neighborhood of the Kings Mountain Ranch, it suddenly headed in a east northerly direction towards Sims Lake and disappeared (like a bat out of hell over the horizon).

It had lights all around outlining it, which from time to time changed color from blue white to red.  It moved slowely at first around 20 mph.  It was just above the trees,  and its size was estimated to be 3 to 5 times the size of the B2 Bomber!  At one time while I was driving, our son saw a huge blurry red light in the middle of the underside of the craft.  Sometimes the craft seemed to have a halo, or force field around it. When it almost reached Kings Mountain Ranch, it suddingly crossed the road, flew over the ranch, and disappeared into the direction of Sims Lake/Whiteman AFB! Like said, it flew like a &quot;bat out of hell&quot; suddingly over the horizon and dissappeared!&quot;  The object was also seen by another witness!  While some attended the Tri-Lakes-UFO Convention last November 2003 in Kimberling City, one of the vendors at the conference who sold UFO related books,  also admitted that he had seen the same object at about the same time,  when he was living in the area between Sims Lake in line with Whiteman AFB.     -   Therefore there were at least 6 witnesses to the craft who were qualified observers, and can state that it was not a Russian Satellite or similar object,  that the TV Stations were aluding to.

At times it also seemed to shift, for a second or so, to a slight reddish color and then back to white.  In size it was at least ten times that of the biggest star in the sky. Now from here on in I&rsquo;m not sure if what I saw was real or imagined. There seamed to be small dot shaped, orangish &ndash; reddish in color, &ldquo;balls, disks&rdquo; in the surrounding area of the light. They numbered perhaps eight or ten. I referred to them as dots because they were perfectly round as a dot and with no extending light beyond the actual shape. Then I saw what appeared to be two of the dots move away at a fairly fast speed. The one followed the other in exact formation space and distance from the other. As they moved away a white light was added to the orangish/red color.  They continued moving away and finally disappeared. At one point approximately 30 minutes after I first saw the light it dropped lower in the sky, just a little, the reason I noticed this was because it was now just slightly below the tree line. Before going to bed, 11:00 pm, I went to take a last look and it was gone.((name deleted))", "Yellowish/orange star like lightApril 9, 2004:   At 8:45pm central time, I was observing the sky to the east and noticed a star like object in the sky that was moving downward. The object seemed to be rotating high in the atmosphere and was reflecting light at intervals of 3 to 4 seconds while it moved slowly downward, almost snakelike. The light seemed to be the steady magnitude of a dim star when not reflecting. I lost sight of the object at about 30 degrees above the horizon. 9:10pm:   At my zenith facing eastward, I saw another star like object moving SSW and followed it for about 20 seconds with 7x35 binoculars. The color of the light through the binoculars was yellowish blending into an orange/red on the outer edge and did not blink or pulse. I could see no shape to the object, only light. I looked down to see what the time was, and when I looked back up, I could no longer find the object. Weather conditions were clear and mild.", "The object was in the form of a light, silently traveling from north to south, dissappearing from view without acceleration.It was a warm Labor Day, I was working as a part time security shift at the Roadway Trucking station. It was my second year working there. On the second year I gradually developed the urge to start looking up into the sky. On that day I was speaking to a friend from a private business just down the hill, who walked his dog four times a day past the compound. We were discussing the possibility of UFOs and aliens, as we often did. At a point I complained to him something to the effect, &quot;I&apos;ve been watching the sky around here for a long time. I know other people have seen UFOs. How come I never seen any?&quot; Before long my friend and his Dog returned to their place down the hill. Approximately 45 minutes later, at twilight, I was listening to a program on my small radio and walking across the property from west toward the one building on the compound to the east. To my left, high in the sky; higher than most of the local aircraft flew in the area, and travelling a bit faster, was a lighted object traveling from north to south. I then said to myself, &quot;What&apos;s this?&quot; As I watched, the object began flying in an up and down pattern once, and then again, and possibly a third time but I can&apos;t be sure. But certainly at least two times. I never seen aircraft fly in this manner and I knew that no conventional craft could do that. The object traveled along after the unusual aerial display and then suddenly blinked out.It didn&apos;t burn out like meteors and shooting stars, but blinked out, and I&apos;ve witnessed enought meteors to know the difference. The sky was clear and light enough where I would be able to locate it in the event it had turned in another direction, but I could not find it. It was just gone. No acceleration, just gone, as if it had gone into another dimension, if you can imagine that. At that point I began to realize that I had just witnessed my first and so far, only UFO. And it showed up within 45 minutes after complaining out loud that I have never seen one. It was as though someone heard m! y complaint and decided to show themselves to me. My friend and his dog returned shortly after dark and I told him that I indeed had seen a UFO. My friend started to explain the UFO away but then started offering an explanation on how we on Earth began with the wheel and the aliens began with &quot;flight&quot; as if he knew all about something.The next day I was working in Chula Vista making a patrol around a large motel and spotted a black car parked in the rear of the building with its windows so dark I could hardly see inside. The vehicle was not on the motel guest list. I won&apos;t go into detail the remainder of that incident.  But I&apos;ll end this by saying that my report is the honest to God truth exactly as I have told it. I swear on a stack of Bibles. I don&apos;t know what the object was or its origins but I never seen anything like it prior nor after it. I am retired military and observed many times aircraft in the sky, but again, nothing that came close to the lighted object and its impossible aerial performance.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Large white oval light passing over Pheonix, AZ.I was out walking our dog, when glacing up at the sky I noticed a large glowing white object in the southern sky, at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon. It was traveling West to East, consistently at a slow speed.  The size was about 1/4 the size of a full moon. It&apos;s shape is best described as oval. I watched it till it was out of view.", "2 people saw strange comet shaped lights in the sky traveling at unusual speeds and proximity to earthAccount written by ((name of husband deleted)) I, ((name deleted)) and my wife, ((wife&apos;s name deleted)) observed on March 15, 2004 at approximately 8:30 PM, while traveling in our vehicle on Hope Chapel Rd. going North, a spectacular sight. ((wife&apos;s)) glasses were in hand, but she feels the object looked like a comet, because of a trail behind it. (We have noted that a comet came close to the earth on Mar 18, but not on the 15th). According to myself, ((husband)), (who saw it clearly), I feel there were 2 lights traveling from East to West close together. Both of us agree that it did not move smoothly as an airplane would. I, ((husband)) feel that there were 2 lights traveling slow together, at which point, the leading light, sped up while the other one &quot;hung back&quot; and then disappeared. Very possible that it was a government aircraft given the close proximity to McGuire Air Force Base and the current technologies to counter global terrorism.  Remotely possible that it was extraterrestrial in nature. ((wife)) thinks it may have even been a plane crashing because she noted a downward patten toward the earth. We couldnt find any record of any plane crashes.", "Large, slow moving craft, above the clouds, blinked out like a lightbulb before reaching the horizonNEW BERLIN, Wisconsin , July 4th,1960  I&apos;m surprised that no one has reported the BIG UFO sightings from 1960 in Wisconsin . The first one occurred on the evening of July 4th, 1960 at dusk while we were standing high on a hill in New Berlin, WI waiting for the fireworks to start. The sun had gone down. We could see spotlights searching the skies over Milwaukee about 15 miles away. There were some clouds in the sky, but not many. All of a sudden, I saw movement over my head. I looked straight up and a saw a white circular craft moving slowly from behind me from south toward the north. It moved very slowly. It was above the clouds. I double checked to see if there was a possibility of the searchlights from Milwaukee to be making a search way out here in New Berlin, but it wasn&apos;t. The white craft was above the clouds. It was about the size of a quarter held at arm&apos;s length. It moved slowly toward the north, never deviating from its course and never changing speed ... very slow. The strange thing was that before it got to the horizon, it blinked off like a light bulb. I called my sister on the telephone who had been about 25 miles away and she said that she had seen the same thing, so we reported it to the Hynek Institute in Chicago, giving a written report within the week. Hundreds of people have had to have seen that, but we never met any. The very next day, on July 5th, during the afternoon, there was another sighting by hundreds of people on the Lake shore of Lake Michigan. I just happened to be standing inside the house by the window facing north. Off to the east I saw a greenish white craft going downward towards the north quite aways off. It was about the same size as the one I had seen the night before. I found out the next day in the newspaper that hundreds of people had witnessed the UFO dive into Lake Michigan with an aircraft chasing it over the lake which had been scrambled by Billy Mitchell airfield. It was published in the two Milwaukee Journal/Sentinel newspapers the next day, but researchers have not been able to find it in the newpaper archives.", "Small white light makes 90 degree turn in sky.During the fall grain harvest in approx 1983 around 2200hrs, I was the truck driver waiting for the combine to have it&apos;s next load of grain.  I was facing west and the combine was approx 1/4 mile away at the time and hidden behind a roll of hills.  There was no lights from buildings in the area, no road traffic, there was no moon light that evening &amp; it was nice and clear.  I was standing outside of the grain truck looking at the stars, when I noticed what I thought was a satellite coming from the north/west going south/east.  It was just a bright little light, just like any satellite which I had seen several times before.  When I first noticed it, it was almost straight above me, approx 80 degrees off the horizon.  It was travelling about the speed of other satellites I had seen in the past &amp; since.  After watching this light move for approx 5-10 seconds, and at this point it was almost directly above me at 90 degrees, it made a perfect 90 degree turn without losing any speed and started to head directly east.  A split second after the object turned, I noticed a second object, a red flashing light which I assumed to be a tail light or wing light of an aircraft following the first object.  It appeared to be coming from the same direction as the first object.  It made a more of a swooping/banking turn to turn to the east and followed the first object.  Very much like any normal aircraft would have to do, in making a turn.  Both objects headed east, the first object from what I recall was way ahead of the red flashing light in no time at all.  I don&apos;t recall the first object changing speed or streaking away or anything like that, but making that 90 degree turn was pretty wild and it got ahead very quickly becasue the other object took longer to turn to the east.  After the 90 turn I could see the objects for approx another 5 seconds.  I didn&apos;t hear anything unusual during the event, however an hour or two latter when we had finished working for the evening and I was taking a shower and my ! father was upstairs in the house, he heard a loud boom or a bang, which I didn&apos;t hear.  A sonic boom?? maybe??  The closest military airbase with jets, is in Cold Lake, about 2 hrs away by ground to the north/west.  At the time there was a military air base in Edmonton about an hour away by ground,to the west, however I think they only had helicopters at that site.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "5 Silver Saucers flying from over the Salt Lake, and flying over the Oquirah Mountains towards DugwayGL son of an newspaper editor, and my self were looking through his telescope at the close encounter of a comet.  His telescope was a complex refractor, had variable power, 4 inch light gathering power, had tracking ability, and could mount a 33mm camera.  He had won the regional High School Science with his rocket project.  I had participated with my Coal Tar Project, and won honorable mention at the State Science Fair at BYU, the same time Dr. KT won the prise in physics.   After looking at the comet with binoculars and through his telescope and taking pictures,  we saw 5 saucer shaped, silver objects flying from the direction of the Salt Lake, and flying towards the area of Kennecott&apos;s copper refinery.  The objects were small with the unaided eye, but were much more clear through binoculars, and his telescope.  We focused the telescope with the telescope viewfinder. and brought them within view.  Originally the objects moved slowely, to the site mentioned, and then stopped in flight and started hovering.  We could see through the instruments, that there were several distinct separate objects, and they were not the lights from one single craft.  We looked for insignia to se if they were possibly US Air Force vehicles, or army helicopters.  There shapes told us that they were unusual crafts.  We brought it to the attention of GL&apos;s father, and he also looked at them also through the instruments.  He stated that we should mount the camera on the telescope and take pictures of them.  The occurance took about 10 to 20 minutes in total.  After the 5 saucers where hovering in a still position, which appeared to not spin, they suddenly started moving and spinning, and headed at an increasing speed, up over the Oquirah Mountains, in the direction of Tooele Ordinance/Deseret Chemical and Dugway Proving Ground, and suddenly disappeared out of sight.  They didn&apos;t change color, and there was no trails, and no noticeable sound.    We discussed afterwards the event.  When I went home,  I told my pare! nts also of the event.  Dad said that I should report it, since there had been a number of UFO sightings in the area.  I talked to GL over the phone about the matter.  He said that his father told us to wait until the pictures are developed.  After the pictures were developed, we also had them enlarged.  One could clearly see that there was some advanced technology, w;h;ich we were not familar with.  My friends dad, then said that since he was a newspaper editor, he had an obligation to first call Hill Air Force Base, because he didn&apos;t want to reveal any Government secrets to the public.  After calling them, an appointment was made for the Hill AFB Investigating Officers to come and talk to us.  Three officers, including an AF Major came to talk with us.  After sitting down with us, discussing and recording the event. and looking at the pictures, they started mak;ing recommendations and requests.  They said it was in the interest of the sec;urity of our nation, for us to release the prints and negatives to them for analysis.  My friend gave up the prints, and negatives as reequested to them.  They told the edi;tor not to release the materials or report to the press until fu;rther notice.  We waited a few days, and an answer came.  A call from Hill AFB&apos;s rep came, and he strongly advised us to forget the happening, otherwise action could take place.  The Editor questioned him, and the rep answered that he was advised by the Army CIC that severe penalties could take place if the word would get out.  I followed the advice, and didn&apos;t ever mention the incident until 1966 when I attended a UFO Conference in Denver, and also talked to Dr. E. U. Condon.   GL eventually graduated from MIT,  and I believe that he still has some secretely kept prints.", "Green plasma ball style object over Chicago, ILI walked out to my car late at night to get something out of it. As I was just about to enter back into the house I was extremely compelled to stop, turn around, and look upwards into the sky facing East. As I stood there looking into the sky for over a minute this overwhelming feeling was getting stronger so I decided to trust this &quot;gut feeling&quot; and keep looking. I can&apos;t remember exactly how long I was standing there all together, maybe 5 minutes, but I stood there like a rock to satisfy this overwhelming feeling. Eventually something did happen. This large &quot;ball&quot; of neon-green looking object appeared coming from the South traveling in a Northbound direction which also left a flame trail of some sorts behind it. It appeared to travel a few miles from the point in which I first noticed it and may have been coming down at a 5-10 degree angle? At first I was convinced that it was some sort of meteor but then it stopped in mid air for a few seconds. As it stood there in the air it made all sorts of colors and during these color changes I was able to make out some sort of circular shapes. It also had something glowing &quot;around&quot;  and &quot;within&quot; the fluctuating colors. This &quot;something&quot; is best described by looking at a neon-green style Plasma ball. I&apos;m not even sure green Plasma balls even exist but those who know what a Plasma ball is will get the idea. While it was doing this color changing thing it changed direction from going down to the ground traveling Northbound to going up in the air traveling North and then Northeast. It also appeared to be traveling faster when it took off after pausing in the air. It was now obvious that this was no meteor! Unfortunately all I have is a sketching of it that I made within a few minutes after the experience. I still have the sketching and will send it in for better reference. I sure wish I knew what was going to happen instead of just getting a &quot;feeling&quot; of looking up. I probably would have had enough time to get my video camera! The colors from this thi! ng were unlike anything I have ever seen so far in the skies. Regardless of what this object was it has become the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in person. The whole experience now feels like some sort of spiritual experience, strange stuff......", "three triangle Shaped craft recon behind a hill in vista,ca at night.I Am a begining astronomer.

I live in the midsection of a hill. it hovered above the hill and went behind the otherside of the hill for a while and then came back up. it was moving as a helicopeter would but move like a hovercraft. after it came up 2 other craft apeared in the sky identical to the first. they both went behind the hill slowly. about a minute later what looked to be 2 military jets(no joke; sounded like a jet atleast) began to head toward the my house and hill. seconds later 3 beams of light flashed up into the sky and disapeared.

They turned sharply and came parallel to the horison and went on for a couple of seconds, during which they both took another short dive and came back level again (with the same effect of the line on a heart monitor but inverted). From there, they seemed to shoot back up into the sky(still keeping the same distance between them), and vanished back above the clouds and there was no sound at all!! I have never seen anything move that fast in my life and I was surprised there was no mention of it in the papers as this occured less than two miles from Edinburgh Airport. Surely they must have seen glitches on their radar? One thing I remember is that they were illuminating the clouds they were flying under.", "I was driving around my friends house when my friend came out saying to look at the sky because he saw circle shape things.Then I came out of my car and I saw the aircraft for 2 minutes then they disapered.

Included with the report is the photo you see below, plus a 2 mb video clip of the object moving slowly across the sky. As it moves through the sky it changes the most brilliant colors, or for a better word it flashes at a fast rate of speed. The footage is truly amazing. In the photo the witness made a large number of still shots from the video clip and this is what you see below in the photo. Photo can be viewed at: http://www.hbccufo.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1253&amp;mode=&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0  Hello Brian,  Here is something which you may want to get out to a wider audience in whatever format can be done. The last week in April skies were fair and clear around these parts, in Portland, OR. On several nights between 9 and 11 pm I saw some apparent star-like objects on the east or west horizon which seemed to strobe in multiple colors. I could remember seeing red and blue strobing lights with white either accompanying or alternating with the red and blue. While this was, I thought, an uncommon occurrence, I also took some photos with the digital camera. The object did not show much in the photo, even though 10x optical zoom, because the strobing light was not much bigger than a small point of light. On to Plan B. I also have a 127mm diameter x 1250mm focal length Celestron Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope to which the camera can be mounted. With the camera-telescope combination , I can zoom from 31x to 310x power, all of this is optical zoom. At this level of zoom you can begin to see more than a speck of light. I took some regular digital photos, and some short video segments to show the strobing light. The camera &amp; telescope was on a tripod so did not move (except when I kicked it or made camera adjustments). I have attached the short video here, and also the first 48 video still frames which were cut and pasted into a single image. The top row of 8 images are the first eight frames, the 2nd row the second 8 frames, etc. All told there are about 3.1 seconds of time represented by the 48 still frames, one every 1/15th second. In the movie, the object appears to move to the upper left. Since it is viewed thru a telescope without any mirrors, it has to be rotated around 180 degrees so as not to appear upside down and backwards. It actually moved to the lower right before me. This particular object was taken at 9:32pm local time on 4-30-04. The object was on the WSW horizon. I had to constantly track it by moving the scope to the right in small increments. That would make it&apos;s path travelled proceeding approximately to the northwest. In the 48 frame composite photo, the blue outlined frame in the lower right corner is a copy of the very first frame, and I pasted it there as a check for my printer to be sure that it reproduced all the colors. This composite of 48 images has also been resized to 2048 x 1536 to show more detail than the original still frame size of 320 x 240. There is an amazing array of colors and shapes displayed, much more than could be seen even looking through the telescope. The reason I believe this is so is because the eye-brain connection cannot process all the data so quickly as can a video camera. The brain only reports back what limited data that it can process. Some questions I have are,  1. What is it?  2. What is it doing?  3. What is signified by the different colors?  4. Is it in our atmosphere (below 200 miles), or beyond it?  5. The object seems to be flinging something off of it. What could this be?  6. There seem to be traces of apparent gaseous matter around some of the frames. 7. How big is it? It covers about 12 pixels of width in the 320 x 240 pixel frame, at 310x power. 8. Has anyone else captured pictures of a similar object?  9. Could it be a satellite?  10. If we knew how far away it was, a good estimate could be made of the object&apos;s size and travel rate. 11. What kind of technology can strobe this fast continuously?  12. Whose technology is it?  Thanks for looking,  Thank you to the witness for the report, video footage and still photo.

I recently revealed my sighting to a neigbor and he reported seeing the same thing around the same time period.  He states that the craft acted as if it was going to cross the road and did not.  Instead it increased its altitude from just above the tree line to an increase of about 2000 feet in a blink of an eye.  He also said that one of the lights had streaks coming from it, and with in minutes they all disappeared and the sky became darker in a matter of seconds.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "I saw a dark, triangular craft gliding across the sky in Columbus, Ohio.It&apos;s been quite a while since I&apos;ve seen the object I&apos;m going to describe so I&apos;m foggy as to the exact date. I do remember the actual incident quite vividly, though, and will do my best to describe it. I was driving north on highway 315. As I approached the exit to get on Bethel Road, I noticed a dark object moving overhead heading south/south-west. It seemed to be &quot;gliding&quot; slowly overhead, quietly, quite aways away, yet close enough that I could estimate it as being maybe 3-4 car-lengths in size. In the dusk sky light available, it appeared to be dark (black or dark grey) in color. It was still very clear out so I&apos;m positive it was a triangular craft of which I&apos;d never seen before at that time. I must mention that I was driving a convertible car with the top off so I did in fact get a clear view of the object. There were many other cars on 315 and on Bethel Road at the time so I&apos;d be surprised if no others saw it too. I only wish I&apos;d had a camera with me then. At first, I thought it was some experimental craft being tested from the nearby OSU airport on West Case Road, which is located a few miles away from where I saw the craft. It wasn&apos;t until I started seeing similar triangular UFO sightings in books and on television that I realized the craft I saw wasn&apos;t some local aircraft project. The image of the craft that was photographed in the Belgium sighting was almost identical to the one I saw, the only difference being the one I saw didn&apos;t have lights shining underneath each corner, perhaps because the sky was fairly still light outside. Not until I came across this site did I feel there was a neutral way for me to report my sighting without being ridiculed. Please honor my privacy and don&apos;t release my name. Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

She was on her way to get papers that my dad had forgoten when she was startled by the glow in the field and stopped to see.  She sat in shock for a moment and left, shaken.  She made a drawing of it for me before she died three years ago. She was credible as a witness, a mother of seven and not known to tell stories that were not truth. She was not a drinker and didnot take drugs.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Multiple craft over Northern Illinois interacting with each other.At the time this sighting took place, I was 14 years old.  I was talking to the neighbor on the phone when I first noticed a goldish colored ball of light flying over the field behind our house.  My first thought was it was one of several local farmers who had small planes getting ready to make a turn in preparation to land.  As I watched it, I could see something just wasn&apos;t right with the way it was flying, even though most of the farmers were flying the old Piper Cubs, which are capable of flying quite slow, this was even slower than that.  I had seen probably hundreds of fly-bys by the local farmers over the same field, and this just didn&apos;t compare to any of those as far as speed, flight pattern, and the coloration of the lights.  Instead of turning as I expected it to, the light just continued to come straight on towards our house, and soon the brightness of it&apos;s light was just too different from any planes landing lights I had seen.  I yelled at the neighbor on the phone to tell his parents to look out over the field, I then yelled to my mother and two brothers, who were in the next room, to look over the field at the light, which they did.  Just as the light reached the edge of the field, and the fence line, it was if someone turned off a switch, and it went dark.  My mother and brothers came into the kitchen where I was, and I asked my mom if she knew what it could have been.  Before she could answer we heard something passing over the house.  It was more of a sensed sound, rather than audible, maybe more like we felt some sort of pulsing vibration.  Mom seems to remember it sounding like an air compressor, like those at gas stations as they replenish the air supply. When I heard this I ran to the front door, and opened it to go outside, I can remember my mom yelling not to open the door, but it was too late as I had opened it and exited to the outside.  My mom and brothers were standing on the porch yelling at me to come back, as I stood in the front yard looking up at the bottom of the craft which I don&apos;t think was more than 200 feet or so above the house.  There was 1 large light in the center, with a ring over real small lights around that, and a medium size light at the end of each point of the structure, but under the edge, not at the wing tips. I belived the large light was blue, the circle of small lights were orangish.  The ones at the wing points were red and white.  As I looked up at it, I felt something like a mist, it reminded me of a very light spring rain as far as size of droplets, and intensity.   The craft was not moving fast at all, maybe 5 to 10 miles per hour, but that estimate may be off because of it&apos;s size, which was I estimate to be 200&apos; from furthest point to furthest point.  I then noticed that my eyes were beginning to burn, and that when I tried to look up at it, I could no longer keep my eyes open.  It was not a burn like an acid burn, but more like an irritation, as you would get spraying a fine mist of salt water into your eyes.  At this time I retreated back to the porch, where my mom and 2 brothers were. The craft seemed to stop over the trees across the street from our house and just hover there for about 3 minutes, then began to ascend straight up.  It did not change it&apos;s attitude to ascend.  The front did not rise, the back did not drop, it just remained level and started to go straight up.  I then noticed that at a high altitude a single white light appeared and seemed to be getting larger and brighter.  In the next few minutes, I seen 3 more craft, identical to the one that had passed over our house appear, it seems from 3 other directions.  I remarked that the one that had passed over our house had arrived out of the south, of the others, one came from the north, one from the east and one from the west.  That large white lighted object grew to be about 10 times the size of each of the smaller craft and then stopped it&apos;s descent.  All 4 of the smaller craft seemed to be hovering, with fronts of their craft pointing towards this large white object.  Then one of the smaller craft moved slowly towards the larger craft, and when it&apos;s front seemed to make contact with the larger object, it suddenly began to rotate in a clockwise fashion, nose to large craft. This gave me the impression that the larger craft was in fact rotating in this fashion. and the small craft must have docked with it.  One by one each of the other small craft also docked with the larger craft, and soon all 4 small craft were, as best as I can describe it, sliding sidways around the perimeter of the larger craft. This went on for about 30 minutes, when one by one each of the smaller craft broke away from the larger craft, and flew off in opposite directions.  One to the south, one north, one east and one west.  The large white object simply ascended back up into the sky until it was lost from sight. When my dad arrived home soon after he was sceptical, so he split us all up into different rooms, and gave each of us a piece of paper and a pencil. Told each of us to draw the object and label anything we had seen. It wasn&apos;t long before he was frantically running from room to room, because all of our drawings matched.  My mom appeared on several local radio programs over the next few days and was interviewed.  Many of these programs had people calling in claiming they saw the same objects.  It turned out the neighbors had been so frightened by it, they closed all their curtains, lit candles and had all their children gather in the living room and prayed through the whole ordeal.  The story also appeared for several days in the local newspaper, The Beloit Daily News, Beloit, WI.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Saw  the same object , twice, out to sea , while serving in U.S. Navy.I was serving in the U.S. Navy at the time, serving on a destroyer. We were out to sea for at least a month when this occured. We were out in or near the Carribeans in the atlantic ocean. We had been circling in a navigation box for at least a few days with the rest of our battle group. The first incident occured when we were undergoing an unrep(taking on fuel)from a naval tanker.It was already dark and the entire crew was out on deck preparing for this unrep. I was standing on the flight deck with some of my shipmates when I noticed that the fuel tanker had an unusual amount of lights on it&apos;s mast. Lots. I just kept staring at this mast, then suddenly I noticed that some these lights separated from the rest of the mast. At first I thought it was the helo(helocopter) but our helocopter was secured inside and I could clearly see the other ships helocopter on their flight deck. Now I could see 5-6 white lights in a sort of arch formation following us. Nobody else seemed to see this. I stared at this object for at least 2 min. then I tried to tell my shipmates to look at it, but before I could finish my sentence the object turned one light off then the rest of the lights shut off in order! I thought it was so strange but I had no time to dwell on it because I had work to do.The second incident happened a few days later when we were preping a old destroyer for target practice the next day. It was dusk and there was still light in the sky.We were sitting dead in the water, when I came out for my watch duty at the back of the ship (fantail) My Friend came back to visit me and to have a cigarette. We were both paying attention to what our crew was doing with the old destroyer, when I turned around and saw to my right the same 5-6 white lights or orbs, in a row, not even 50-70 yards away! My friend turned around at that time and saw them too. I knew from my training that it wasn&apos;t military or commercial aircraft. The weird thing was, was that this object made no sound at all, nor was it moving in any way. I noticed that there was no mass or structure to it, just white lights or orbs an arms length apart. Please remember that it was dusk and I saw nothing but lights. I don&apos;t know how long it was there before we noticed it, but it was definately looking right at us. After about 2-3 min. of this it did the same thing again, it shut off one light(from my left) then the rest shut off in a row. Then it was just gone! Heard nothing, saw nothing. My friend freaked out and ran off leaving me there all alone to stand the rest of my watch all night. When I confronted my friend the nexy day, he refused to talk about it and ran off, clearly disturbed. It took me a few days to realize that it was the same object I seen that night we were taking on fuel. Now this is a real story, I&apos;m not crazy, I saw what I saw. Has anybody had a similar incident, please let me know.  (oh, I tried to alert operations about what I saw, but they saw no aircraft on their radar)", "Silent, fast, low traveling lights fly over Edmonton Sunday nightApproaching Edmonton from the northwest.  At first thought it was a low flying jet but as it got closer I witnessed that there was several lights on it and that it was very large.  Hard to tell exactly how large, could not make out any shape of the craft, just its lights, white in colour and spread out in a clylinder shape.  As it passed by me it appeared to be no more than 2 kms away at most.  If at 2kms it would have been at least 200 meters in lenght. I noticed them approaching quite far in the distance and looked like a single light until it approached closer to me It took only 25 seconds to pass by me from the first light I saw and then clear the horizion where it disapeared in the light reflection of the city.  No sound emmitted from the objects as they passed by, as I expected to hear something with the speed in which they were obviously traveling, guessing 1000 kms per hr plus at minimum.((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar reports about apparently the same event.

At first I thought it was a rescue flare but was too small. We watched for about 10 min. No sound, No other lights. 3 more objects followed the path in the same course as the first.

Conditions were extremely clear as the area was experiencing &quot;Santa Ana&quot; conditions, record high temps for the date.  Light displayed &quot;erratic&quot; motion, moved from side to side, right angle moves, etc.  Light displayed a slight flicker, but this certainly could be due to atmospheric conditions.  Total field covered by the moving light was approx. 5 degrees in any direction.  The light was also viewed by a witness whom I notified via cell phone, approx. 15 miles to the south of my position.  This indicates to me that the source of light was extremely far away.  I attempted to have an additional witness view the light from San Diego, (approx. 120 miles to the south), but was unsuccessful.  I first viewed the light at approx. 8:55PM, sighting lasted to approx. 10:15PM  I did not notice any change in the pattern of commercial jet activity (flight approaches coincided with the general vicinity of the light) during the entire time of the light display.((NUFORC Note:  Our first suspicion is that the light might have been a celestial body, probably Venus, which is in the northwestern sky, at the angle of elevation indicated by the witness.

While at my grandmother&apos;s house, my mother sent me to our car to get a sweater for her. It was in the trunk. While opening the lid, I got the feeling that I was being watched. I looked all around, but saw nothing alarming. I got the sweater then looked up for some reason, and I saw a round object at about 1500 feet (maybe a 100ft higher or lower). I watched it for about 2min...It just hovered there, right over my head, not moving. then it shot up at an extreemly high speed and in less than a second was almost out of sight. It was round-It had a cone like shaped bottom, with what looked like about six rings around the cone. I remember some movement at the outer edge of the air-frame. when I got back to my mother with the sweater, I told her what I had seen, aand i got spanked for taking an hour to get her sweater...I would have to bet my life I was only gone 5min....I have no recolection of those other 55min.

During the evening I notice 4 falling stars within about an hours time, so when we left our friends house about 2am, we decided to drive out onto a country road and do some star gazing. The town we live in only has a population of 2500 and the nearest city is 60 miles away, so we don&apos;t need to go very far to get away from the lights, and since their was no moon, the place we stopped was completely dark.  We were laying on the hood of my car and I noticed a light moving very slowly across the sky. At first I thought it was a satellite but then I saw a second light moving parrallel with it. I pointed at the lights and asked my girlfiend if she saw them and she said &quot;What that triangle?&quot; Thats when I saw the third light following behind forming a triangle. It looked like 3 stars moving about 5 miles per hour but they stayed exactly the same distance apart. We couldn&apos;t see the craft, but the stars couldn&apos;t been seen within the area of the lights, so it was more like watching a black triangular void with a star at each point slowly moving across the sky. The craft was completely silent and looked like it was about 100&apos; above the trees. We watched the lights for about 10 minutes, until they were obstructed by the trees.", "Lights over Paterson NJ 1980It was at night around 9:00pm the sky was clear and the night was beautiful.

On March 8, 2004, I was testing a new digital camera I had bought for my upcoming vacation to Hawaii. The camera takes mpeg video as well. At 12:54 a.m., while my boyfriend and I were laying in bed, I had the camera pointed out our bedroom skylight (skylight is 8 ft. x 6 ft) when I noticed a white light in the LCD screen. At first I thought it was a star, but then I realized it was moving, so I thought it might be a comet.  I continued to record for a total of 1 min 14 seconds. When I played the video on my computer at 200% zoom, I was surprised at what I saw.  The object had different colored lights that would change from green to red to blue to yellow, and the lights would appear to be perfectly circular then they would rotate and change into a white streak, then change again into 5 cirular lights each a different color-red green yellow blue purple.  The object could not be seen-just the lights that rotated around it.  I was able to change the contrast and brightness in my media player, and when I did, a second row of lights can clearly be seen above the first, but rotating in the opposite direction. There is a also a strange haze around the object as it moves.  (I would like to add the fact that I have taken into account any possible reflections from the skylight, however,all the lights were off in the house. The only light in the room was from the LCD screen)  I will be forwarding the video to you via U.S. Mail.

My dad came home about 9PM on his Honda 200. When he got off his bike in the back yard where our garage was. He noticed a glare on his visor. He looked up and there it was a craft approx 200feet across. About 60-100 feet up, it was just hovering there inching its way south towards highway 17, which, is now I-880. We lived on Norton Avenue, which is off of 1st Street near Avery Honda. 1st goes onto Stevens Creek Blvd. The craft was heading southward. No sound...just the light breeze of the evening blowing the 50-foot tree in our back yard. My dad yelled at us we heard him because we were in the living room and were waiting for him to come in since we heard his bike pull up. We went outside on the covered back porch. Dad told us &quot;look up&quot; I did My God! There it was this large circular craft burn marks on the edges, a bright whitish center extended from the bottom of the craft it was 30ft in diameter with multi colored lights surrounding it. These lights were an integral part of the extended bright white circle on the bottom. They formed the raised edge around the center bright white circle. We watched in awe as the craft slowly inched southward not even thinking to grab our Polaroid one step. The neighbor pulled up and stepped out of his car looked over at us and then looked up. I think it was the only time I heard him cuss. My dad went over to him on our side of the fence and asked do you see that? He looked at my dad and said, &quot;I see nothing at all!&quot; and then resumed looking up. As the craft moved southward me and my brother climbed up onto of the garage and watched it head southward. I could see the saucer shape the center of the craft was tall and spherical forming a half circle about half the diameter of the whole craft. The edge of this sphere shape slowly tapered to the outer edge of the craft where the bottom and top of the craft came together. The whole craft was symmetrical in design a circular saucer shaped craft. There were not sharp edges except the out! er edge and the protruding bottom white lit circle with multi colored edge. No lighting was visible from the top of the craft. My mom finally figured out about 20 minutes after the craft was out of sight to call the air force. Within 30 minutes there were an uncountable amount of aircraft in the air above south San Jose. I still wonder today if anyone else watched what I did that night.

The first set were of them in their living room, then shortly after that I went outside to take some photos of their house (which is only about 2 yrs old). Outside and across the road facing west with no sun visible in the sky, I started to take some shots that were more or less experimental,testing different settings. I was using a Canon EOS 10D digital camera with a Sigma 24-70mm lens. Later this evening I and my girl friend were reviewing our shots and noticed through enlarging (in the camera)something over their house.

I am 37 Yrs. old. I saw a small blinking light the size of a star almost directly overhead that I knew was a plane. About 1Min. behind it was another plane. They were traveling N/NE. This is normal because I live 15Min. from Fayetteville Regional Airport and 25Min. from Fort Braggs front gate. I am used to seeing planes of all types. As are most people that live here. Suddenly under the first plane flew a orange-red fireball from out of nowhere. It left a trail like a meteor. It was the size to me of a dime at arms length. It was traveling opposite the planes (S/SW.) From the direction of Fort Bragg. The fireball passed the first plane and vanished. I figured it was a meteor. Then it reappeared and passed under the second plane and vanished again. I waited and it reappeared again and vanished. It traveled like a stone skipping on water except the stone would be vanishing every time it hit the water. It did this a total of five times and was gone almost making the horizon.

I was a System Analysis for SAC in the early 1960 and stationed at Ellsworth AFB, SD.   I have held the nation&apos;s highest security clearance, take no drugs, am a tea toddler and have never hallucinated in my life. During this same time I frequently rode to and from the Minuteman silos, in South Dakota, on HP helicopters.  So I have seen these aircraft up close and personal on many occasions.  I have thus a many year experience with B-52s at close and medium ranges.  In the late 60s I had many personal experiences with the C-5A in Georgia, where they were being designed and built.   About this same time I saw the Blackbird at Elgin AFB, Fla.  So when I say that what I saw over my home in Washington state early one winter night in the late 1980s or early 1990s wasn&apos;t a miliary or civilian aircraft of any known type, I am speaking with some authority. What I saw as a very large, slowly moving delta shaped object that blotted out at least 30 degrees of the nighttime sky.  The object was moving from the SSW and headed, thus, towards the NNE.  This is an occasional glide path for some military aircraft head from Macord AFB, in Tacoma, about 40 NNE of my home.  The object was about 20 degrees above the horizon, but appeared to move upwards as it passed nearly overhead.  My young son, Max, then about eight, i.e., c. 1990, was with me.  We were both in my hot tub which was located about fifty feet behind and to the West of my home at ((address deleted)) Rd, Centralia, WA.  It would have been early evening about 8 or 9 PM., PST. The object had lights at the front and &quot;wing&quot; tips, clearly making the &quot;Delta&quot; shape easy to see.  What was so curious about the object was it&apos;s size and the total silence of it&apos;s travel.  I have never seen a larger object in the sky.  Keep in mind that I have frequently seen both B-52s and C-5As takeoff at close range, i.e., right over my head and at very low altitudes.  At these altitudes these aircraft must be using full power to stay airborne and are thus quite loud.  This object, however seemed to be &quot;floating&quot; though it was obviously not a balloon.  I would describe the propulsion as &quot;gravitational&quot; rather than aerodynamic.  There was no hint of the roar of these jets nor was there any sound similar to a helicopter or copters. No &quot;thump/thump&quot; of blades.   I would say that this object was at least the size of a C-5A, right on the deck.  However if the object was at five thousand feet, far more likely, given my impression of the object and the cloud cover that evening, which was broken with the ceiling at about 5,000 feet. So if the object was at 5,000 ft, &quot;gliding&quot; slowly over head, it would have been many times larger than any C-5A.  Indeed this was my impression of this &quot;craft.&quot;  The entire time I had it in sight, not long, only about one minute, my impression was of *hugeness*.  The object seem to be at least a thousand feet across.   It is easy to give the impression of size.  The object was as large as the oak tree that stands near the hot tub and pool in the back ward.  This tree covers about 25 degrees of the sky from the tub. I add that the lights were not aircraft lights.  They were not flashing, they were not port and starboard, red and green lights,. they were white, but not sealed beams pointing down, as they would have illuminated us as they passed &quot;overhead&quot;.   The &quot;glowed.&quot;   I say &quot;overhead&quot; because it missed being directly overhead by what appeared to be a few hundred feet, i.e., it appeared to be over my barn and not over my hot tub. These could not have been separate objects, because the entire sky was blotted out between them.  The stars and clouds disappeared between them and this &quot;area&quot; moved with the lights as the light moved.  I could not see any metallic &quot;underside,&quot; just darkness.  Now this entire thing is complicated by the fact that I was not wearing my glasses.  So I would not be able to see much detail.  I can easily make out the planets, first, second and third magnitude stars.  I would say these lights were at least of the brightness of Venus. My son, however, has normal sight and I had him give me a running narrative.  He saw no detail between the lights and clearly confirmed that the entire sky was blacked out between them.  I have reported the sighting.  NPR carried the report, nation wide, since I heard from former friends, a few years after it happened, when I attended a public meeting on UFO&apos;s at the local library (Centralia, WA). During those years I kept a daily planner and have preserved them, so I could, no doubt pin point the date with some luck and time.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As I was driving north on I-65, I saw a black and shiny aircraft off the side of the freeway. It held an altitude of about 800 to 1,000. At first, I thought it was to be a helicopter because the way it was shaped, but I noticed no propeller of any kind. It also amazed me as it turned sideways. As it turned, it looked 2-dimensional, and then into a bright star for a split second after. I don&apos;t think the bright shine on the craft came from the sun because the light seemed to be emitting very brightly than that of a reflection.

This is near the Stuart/ Jupiter Island area. They were in a stationary position slightly above horizan and directly ahead of us when I first observed them . Through my binoculars one light appeared larger and slightly lower than the other. No shape or supporting structure was visible. There were several cellphone towers in the vicinity. The lights appeared three times higher than the towers and remained fixed as we approached  and drove directly under them. At this point the larger light seemed to be one fourth the size of the moon with the other slightly smaller. They were very close together. There were no flashing lights.

The conditions were clear with gusty winds.  Visibility was good.  I was looking to the northwest. A movement and light, coming from the west, caught my attention:  I looked up, a few degrees north of the zenith and saw what I initially thought to be a meteorite travelling eastward.  I realized it wasn&apos;t a meteorite - it was arrow-shaped with a blunt nose and resembled a military aircraft but it was completely silent.  There were no flashing lights but cast a dull reddish-bronze light which illuminated the entire underside.  I could see the general shape only because of this glow. It was travelling at high speed.  It did not turn, nor change direction but continued to fly in a straight trajectory overhead, towards the north. It appeared to be flying at a low altitude.", "Clear sphere seenI live near an airport and was on my way home from work. I was watching an airliner taking off while exiting the interstate. I noticed something shining well above the jet. I saw a small sphere that seemed to be invisible, but it was reflecting sunlight and you could see the outline. Kind of like the camouflage on the Predator movies. I saw it for about 10 seconds. I then looked down to see where the traffic was.

It appears to be a dull gray in color. HBCC UFO Research is investigating. Photos can be found at: http://www.hbccufo.com/index.php  Received: April 11, 2004  I had an email from a fellow who resides in Trail, British Columbia. He asked if I would like to see some photos of an unusual mark he has on his back. He added his phone number in his letter and I called the man straight away and had a nice talk with him. The fellow told me when he was around 9 -12 years old a large scoop mark appeared out of nowhere at the base of his spine. The gentleman said at that young age (9 - 12) he was literally plagued with vivid dreams which were very real to him. When the mark appeared out of nowhere on his back he was seen by a physician who told them that it looked as if &quot;someone&quot; had taken a chunk out of his back. The man said there was never any pain associated with it and no scaring. The fellow explained that there is a thin layer of skin which is covering the indentation and nerves in his back. The nerves are sensitive to the touch. The scoop mark focused around a very detailed dream of hearing a strange chatter. In his vivid dream he found himself standing in front of his father&apos;s property, which is located in the Creston, B.C. Approximately 40 feet in front of him was a craft which was hovering about 6 to 10 inches off of the ground. It was spherical in shape but flat on the bottom, a dull aluminum in color and had no distinguishing markings on it. He said there was a green glow (a vapor cloud) which surrounded the craft. It made no sound but he did feel an odd vibration the craft emitted. (His example was, if you took your hand and placed it on running equipment and felt the vibrations from it) He didn&apos;t find all of this disturbing at all. The fellow never saw any kind of creatures of any sort. Also the man was in a state of paralyses and all the time hearing this strange chattering sound. He went on to say that he eventually work up laying on the floor in a pile of laundry and to find his socks were wet from what he believed was from the morning dew outside. There were also was small twigs and a little soil laying about the floor. The fellow told me he is still wondering what actually happened that night many years ago. Also he wanted me to know that this was a one time experience. Thank you to the person for the report and photos. More photos are being taken and will be sent along to me.

Sparks and what looked like debri were falling from object leaving a long trail to the sides and behind object.  The object, when right above us, was about half the size of our lot which is 50 feet wide.  Although it looked as though it was not very high up, we could not tell how high it was.  As it passed beyond our house towards the city (7 miles away), it looked as though it would crash downtown.  Later we heard on the radio that it had crashed on the Chapman Ranch about 150 miles or so from San Antonio.  The next morning the news reported that it was thought to be a piece of a Russian satellite and that a scientific team from Trinity University (San Antonio, Tx) was being sent to investigate. We made several calls to authorities and the airport but no one had seen anything.  What was so strange is that no one that we asked had seen anything either. There was never anything else mentioned in the news about it. It was such a large object that it would be impossible to miss seeing it. We thought even if it was just a Russian satellite, it should have been a huge news story.  My husband and I were professionals working in the computer industry when this occurred.", "I&apos;m not sure where to begin... My earliest memory dates back to when I was an infant.  I&apos;m not sure how old I was but my next memory is my third birthday.I remember a gift that I got and I also remember having this first memory at that time.I can recall even at that age a want to hold on to it and I have. I am lying on my back in the grass.It is night and there is cool a lite breeze.I remember this because I could feel it blowing my hair around.It tickled my forhead.I felt very at ease and calm. The sky was so beautiful.It was filled with dozens of geometric shapes.There were many different colors and they had a soft internal glow that bordered on translucence.They were very soothing and I felt that they were my friends.I know that they were soothing me,like a mother would a child.I cant explain in words what I felt inside but it was like communicating. The duration is probably about 2-5 minutes.Throughout my childhood,it was always my strongest memory and inspired me in everything I did.I&apos;ve always thought that it is what sparked my curiosity about sciece at an early age(got my first shock at 5 by poking around in a telephone outlet). Anyhow,when I was 13,I went to live with my grandparents as a result of my mothers death.I stayed in my dads old room.At about the age of 15,I started having weird dreams.There were so many that I cannot remember the chronology,but I will state some. One of the first was one in which I was having a dream about eating cereal.I thought I started to fall back in the chair and got that rushing,falling into oblivion feeling,that woke me up.I was lying flat on my back in bed and someone approached me from the left.I couldn&apos;t move.From here it gets a little foggy,from terror I think,but &quot;he&quot; lifted my shirt up to my armpit then used something to cut me just under my left nipple.It didnt hurt but I was very scared.I then felt a horrible,numb,type of pain.A pulling sensation coming from the area where I was cut.I couldnt turn my head to see,but out of the corner of my eye,I could see him pulling out a piece of tissue.The pain was incredible.That all I remember until the next morning.My chest was a little sore and I had light scratch in the exact area where he cut me.I also have no muscle in the lower portion of my left breast.I&apos;m 25 years old today,I work out,and I still have no muscle in that area. Another dream is one where I wake up in the middle of the night.There is a pink hazy light coming from my window.I get up and look out.It looks like daytime on an overcast day except in pink.I look to see what time it is and my clock is not on.No power in the whole house,so I dont know what time it is.I had a very strange feeling at this point and decided to go outside.The sky was overcast and pink.Where I live was only a mile north of Rosenblatt Stadium and you could see it from the backyard.We also weren&apos;t to far from S.A.C,so on some days you could wee jets flying in that area.I went around to the back and was shocked to se the sky filled with U.F.O.&apos;s.Discs,cylinders,pyramids,spheres,Etc.I also felt that they saw me,or better yet,were waiting for me.I dont remember anything after that. There are many more but I am no good at typing and am tiring already. One day I got up the guts to bring them up to my dad, &quot;jokingly&quot;,and he later confided in me similar experieces he had as a young man in that house. At the age of 18,I moved to AZ and the dreams stopped.I moved back to a rural part of NE 1 yr later.I have been here for almost 7 yrs now.The dreams have started again and now they involve my young son.This also coincides with a recent sighting of a U.F.O.(it was on the news,on tape).I really wish they would stop.I call them dreams but honestly,there is nothing more real at the time.I&apos;ve never told anyone else about them before,and feel kind of silly,but I need to get it off of my chest. I know this isn&apos;t a specific &quot;sighting&quot;,but I had to get it out.Sorry.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

I saw a disk/saucer UFO, ran in to get my Mother, pulled her outside and pointed, there was the UFO at same point, hovering approxmiately 20 ft above the electrical pole; within 10-15 seconds, boom, it took off.  My Mother couldn&apos;t belive her eyes.  We left our home our 7:10pm that evening, taking back streets, which have minimal light, to get to where we were going.  Suddenly here came the saucer streaking in the sky above us; we viewed it again. The saucer in its stationary position when we first viewed it, was silver in color, with one row of lights above and two rows of lights below.  Picture a dinner plate with one bowl lying downside on the top of the plate, and one bowl lying upside on the bottom of the plate. Between the plate and each bowl were the rows of lights. The upper lights were red, and the lower two rows were green and yellow.  The lights were individual sections that would pulsate and go on individually.

I had spent that day as any normal kid would, playing with my best friend then we raced across a small creek and my foot was cut through my tennis- shoes.  The cut was very deep across the pad behind my left big toe. My friend ran to get a Conselor to help me.  The cut would not stop bleeding.He carried me on his back piggy style.  I had to pull my pant leg cuff to hold my foot up because of the throbbing pain.  I went to bed that night as the other boys did, (gabbing til sleep).  Somewhere in the night I woke up and startled as heck, realized I was sleeping on the cement serving place. The cement circle was where the conserlors set all the giant serving food pots which was about 4 to 6 blocks from our cabin. What woke me was this weird blue-ish green light that I could see with my eyes closed.  It was about 2 telephone poles above me slowly rising with a small noise in my head.  It looked like a huge (city block wide) black disk with pieces of silver around it&apos;s edges.  In the center was that blue-ish green light.  It slowly rose over me straight up then zipped out of sight. I wasn&apos;t scared, I was actually very calm and relaxed untill I noticed where I was, (in the wilderness at night) I got up, steped down off the cement circle and yelled in pain!  I forgot my foot was injured.  All the pain came back again as I tried to walk on that heel.  As I entered the dark cabin, I accidently went to my best friends bed and grabbed the covers, (It was my friends neck I grabbed and boy did he yell) I tried to tell him what went on, but the other kids yelled , &apos;shut-up!&apos;.  The next morning we saw my bloody foot prints coming from the cabin front door to my friends bed. I tried to explain to our &apos;conselors&apos; what happened and they said, I must be mistaken, there&apos;s only God in the heavens.  And then the memories came back.  A female entity, large head, giant shinny black cat eyes, dull white skin tone, small being. It sounded like a soft gentle female.  It spoke to me with tenderness.  She said her name was, I couldn&apos;t say it right, so she said,&apos;NANE&apos; that&apos;s close enough.  She said she was the leader of a force that protected her planets security.  In an instant, we were on a planet who&apos;s color looked like white-ish grey everywhere. My feet weren&apos;t on the ground and she said, It&apos;s not safe for you. I said where am I, she said, your at the &apos;place of ashes&apos;  she said, you call it The moon.  She said a huge civilization lived there a long time ago.  She said, those craters are not from things hitting the moon, their from a great all out war that destroyed the planet.  She pointed to a UFO in the distance and said, many visitors from other planets come to the &apos;place of ashes&apos; to remember, and collect &apos;artifacts&apos; to take home. She said the Universe was a big giant highway,just like our highways on earth. When she talked, I didn&apos;t see her mouth move, I heard her in my mind.  She told me about different UFO&apos;s, aliens, planets, She said the story of &apos;Jesus Christ&apos; was just that,a story She said governments on earth just used it to control the people! She said, do you think a real all loving God would let Disease,murder,war,hatred,- death,natural disasters exist!!!!?  She said she could do everything and more all by herself than anything I&apos;ve ever read. She has visited me about 3 times and say&apos;s she&apos;s always near.  She has shown me and told me so much that it&apos;s sort of scary!  I am now a movie actor with one academy award film and I still don&apos;t talk about my encounter to anyone. (people think your crazy as the government likes it to be on this topic!) All I can say is, my life &apos;s not the same since that encounter!!!  I can do many,many, different things that I never studied, perfectly!  When I look into a persons eyes, or touch them it&apos;s like a fast visual movie of their life!(I don&apos;t like it at all!!!) When that visual thing happens, it makes me want to throw-up!(feels like I&apos;m going to die!) I&apos;ve learned so much from&apos;NANE&apos; that it would take a lot of writing to explain it, and it&apos;s coming true!  I&apos;m going to write an E-Book on the net about, &apos;NANE&apos; and give it away free, just download it.  I want other people to know what happened to me! And just maybe, just maybe, there&apos;s others who were visited that night and I could meet them.  There&apos;s so much more she said that I believe is perfectly true!  The free &apos;NANE&apos; E-Book has been ready to download but, I&apos;m a little worried about my movie career! Will people think I&apos;ve lost my mind!? A person can only shut their mouth for so long!  Time to tell the other people what happened! She showed me so much! I hope all read this with intelligence and wisdom for it will come to pass!!!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Object travelled from north to south, noticed it at about 80 degrees and it faded/disapeared at 50 degrees as I was facing south. Seemed very high and very massive, vaguely triangle/rectangle shaped, three irregular shaped very dim glowing areas - low red/amber, appeared similiar to an after-image from viewing a light source; I am, after testing and evaluation,certain that it was not a after-image from looking at the moon.The features were not similiar and after looking away and back again with a little scrutiny I found it again. There was no noise and no flashing lights. At all times it was hard to discern. It seemed to pause at 50 degrees then continued and then I could no longer find it - but this is more subjective. My impression was of a aircraft-carrier floating across the sky but again this is very subjective.", "Silver orb seen in over central park.I was walking around central park, looking for a place to sit where there weren&apos;t too many people. I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t be more sure of the exact time, but I was working on a screenplay all day and was a little but pre-occupied with my own thoughts. At any rate, ust off the 80&apos;s of the west side of central park there is a large field with three baselball diamonds. I rested for a while looking at the game, when as I stood, I caught a glimpse of what I thought was a child&apos;s balloon (the silver kind) floating away, above the trees. It was clearly evident. However, it seemed to change shape, and flatten slightly, then round back out again. And it was pulled in a consistently western direction. This didn&apos;t seem to me like the normal behavior of a floating balloon. As I recall, they usually wobble from side to side as the tie at the bottom swings the weight around. There was nothing like this that I witnessed. It seemed to be moving deliberately. to see it clearly for more than about a minute and a half necessitsated walking over the baseballe diamond, which I neglected to do, as there was a game playing. Or, more accurately, a man was hitting balls for practice and others were catching it. So I only saw it briefly. The object was silver, I could not judge the distance accurately, and so cannot judge the size accurately. It seemed like a blimp, at times, which it may have been. but it appeared to flatten and behave more like a balloon. I could not identify it, hence I&apos;m entering this report. It changed shape as it moved, or at least it seemed to. There was a lot of light in the sky, it was overcast but not directly sunny, with a white, bright sky. It read as silver to my eyes, not emmenating light. It must have been either a blimp, far away, but moving very quickly to cover the distance it did in the sky, or a balloon, moving very slowly, but deliberately. Or something else, I suppose. If anyone else saw this, I would like them to tell me what they observed, just for my own curiousity.

After around 20 minutes it began to chang shape from a star like object to an elipse.  It chaned color from white to red and blue.  It then began to pulse and seemed to grow larger.

I pulled off of the side of the road to check my headlights on my car as I thought one of them had burned out.  It turned out that that was not the case, both were working properly. I just so happened to turn around and look into the eastern sky and saw what I thought was a planet or star shining real bright...then I realised that it was moving due west. All of a sudden, it stopped it&apos;s progress entirely. Then, from the north came another bright object and it pulled close to the other object and you could tell there was a space between the two objects. While both objects were stopped, a red beam came from the north object as if touching the other object for what I observed was for 5 minutes. Then the &quot;red beam&quot; retracted and the first object started a slow forward movement westward and then all of a sudden it shot out of sight at a tremendous speed and dissapeared and the second object turned and went in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed and vanished.

No lights.  Because the moon was shining on its surface it appeared to be bronze on darker bronze (flat finish) colored. It was flying fairly slowly. If I were to estimate maybe 30 miles an hour?  We both commented on how weird that was.  No sound again no lights of any kind.

I believe it was I that said, &quot;What are those lights over there?&quot;  What we observed were maybe five or six rounded lights that were just hovering in the night sky, not high up, not flying around, but moving slightly, ,..not fast, just twinkling in the sky very near us.  Similar to a helicopter when trying to hover over an object.  They moved, but not much.  My father immediately said, &quot;Oh, those are weather balloons!&quot;  I thought he was nuts. I remember the lights having a whitish hew. We observed them for maybe five minutes and then just walked back to the house.  Not a word mentioned ever again, except by me over the years.

I am not a believer in UFOs, at least I wasn&apos;t until this morning.  Even now I&apos;m not so sure what to believe!  I looked up to early morning sky (pre sunrise) to see a commercial airline jet traveling from southeast to northwest at approximately 6:05 AM. Along the contrail I saw a pinhead speck of bright light moving irratically up and down the port side of the contrail.  It darted towards it, then back away from it several times.  The light then traveled up and down the one side of the contrail.  It followed the contrail back up to the rear of the jet then back down the contrail, again.  It then began to dart in and out of the contrail and finally passed through it to the the starboard side.  It repeated its motions up and down and in and out of the contrail, than passed back through it to the port side.  Once again it moved very quickly up to the rear of the jet and then disappear.

This thing was huge, it was like a perfect square building that was floating. All the sides appeared to be smooth. It was moving south in the air under 10MPH and made NO SOUND as it moved. When the stoplight turned green, we proceeded on our way, rather dumbfounded. We were both about 18-19 years old and had never seen anything like this before. I don&apos;t think we knew how to react.

Though it was near the airport, it was too far North to be a tower, etc. As I approached the intersection, I began to realize that this was absolutely an aircraft of some kind, hovering at appx. 100 feet. Being an Air Force veteran, I instinctively turned down my radio, rolled down my window, and put my ear to the wind in order to detect (or not) audibly the sort of power plant that could be lifting this immense craft. There was nothing but the sound of my slowing engine, as I eventually found myself completely bewildered, and at a dead stop ion the highway, head craning out the window. There were three distinct points, each with its own circular, whitish light; no windows, etc. My first thought was something like, &quot;Whatever the hell this is, why would it choose to hover idly right here. Then, I slowly turned back East onto White&apos;s road in order to observe it more closely. As I gazed up at the craft, innumerrable possibilities flashed in and out of my mind, each being dismissed as an impossibility for any number of (known) scientific and avionic detractions, and as this went on, I started to become a bit anxious (again w/regard to any fathomable agenda the craft&apos;s occupants/operators could possibly have), and so I let out the clutch and began rolling forward. As I did, to my utter astonishment, it began moving in the same direction, at the same rate of travel, as I. Anxious to somehow verify what I was seeing, I realized that not one other vehicle was even in sight for about the last three minutes- unusual at the time. Anyway, desiring to hasten fate, I hit the gas and noted that the craft was keeping perfect distance and rate of acceleration to me.  Confused, and somewhat frustrated with my inability to conventionally rationalize, or at least share the experience with even another motorist, I began yelling and giving the SUV everything it had. Almost as if it (they?) had sensed my increasingly negative emotional state, it suddenly broke pace w/ me (@maybe 70 MPH), and began to arc upward and to the West, as its speed increased at an eye-popping rate, and then it went lights out. I hammered the brake, skidding to a stop just in time for the first oncoming vehicle to see nothing more than a cloud of dust around my truck. This was one, though not the first of 4 or 5 events of similar magnitude and inexplicability.

They had a gray hooded sweatshirt on pulled on their head and facing away from me.

It was at a distance of about 2 to 4 kms, looked like it was following the Fraser river, and in front of the hill that Mission is built on. There was low, fast moving clouds (fully overcast)that night.At the time I was in my mid twenties, very involved in my church, rasing my young family. Being spritualy aware (there is much more going on than meets the eyes)but not at all beliving that UFOs were from outer space, but a trick played by Satan to pull people to his side. That is the reason that I did not report this to anyone till recently.Twenty years changes things((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "vertical bright cylindrical objectA short vertical cylinder, very bright, seen just before sunset to the west.It may be a comet, too. It did not seem to move around, but I am not sure because we were driving...", "Three circular lights fuse into one and become an intensly bright beaconHad I known about this site being available back seven years ago, I would have reported it to you all, but I did contact the local sheriffs who responded out to my house, but I don&apos;t believe they took a report.  I am a Federal Police officer and I worked downtown in Washington, D.C. I decided to take off early that Friday night due to boredom when I arrived home at around 2115 hours.  All the lights were off in my house but my husband and eleven year old daughter were in the family room watching TV.  My husband (now ex-husband) went to take a shower while my daughter and I remained in the family room watching the TV. I decided to make hot chocolate for her and coffee for me in our kitchen which was dimly illuminated by the under range top light, when I heard my daughter tell me in a very startled voice, &quot;Mommy, come look at the lights!&quot;  I told her to hold on a minute while I finished making our drinks, but her voice became even more desperate almost pleading with me to come look at the lights, and finally she started crying and almost in a state of panic, &quot;look at the lights!&quot;  I thought she had turned the lights on in the family room because my kitchen lit up as if every light were on.  I turned around and couldn&apos;t believe my eyes when I realized how brightly lit our family room was.  It was a very warm October night, about 68 degrees outside, so we had a few of our windows open, including my sliding glass door in the kitchen which leads to the backyard where my dog Cleo was.  Cleo is a black lab, doberman, dalmation mix, who weighs about 95 lbs.I told her to wait inside while I went outside to see who or what was in my driveway.  As I walked outside, I noticed three circular lights at about tree level across the street at my neighbors house.  The tree was about 35 feet in height and the neighbors house was only about 20 feet high.  In relationship to my house and my driveway, the circular lights were approximately 75 feet from me and were intensely bright.  The circles of light were lined up horizontally and about 35 feet off of the ground.  The circle in the middle was large and appeared to be five feet or so wide, the smaller lights on each side appeared to be two to three feet wide and all three ligths were a combination of amber, cream and white.  A color that I have never seen before or since.  The lights gave off or emitted heat and there was a humming noise in the air.  When I walked out further to try and see what these lights were and where they were coming from, they moved quickly from horizontal to vertical, with the largest light still in the middle.  The larger light seemed to be gyrating or oscillating and the lights appeared to be moving closer to me in which the lights became even more intensely bright, almost blinding me and there was heat being emitted.  I didn&apos;t realize that my little girl had ran outside the door after me, so when I realized the lights were coming closer, and now I placed them at about 30 feet away from me the lights appeared to be like a &quot;beacon&quot; almost with a circular shape and almost to where you couldn&apos;t tell where one circle was from the other -- like they fused together.  I turned around and ran inside, not realizing my child was outside crying, I ran back out to get her and I got her inside when my dog and other neighborhood dogs started growling and howling and acting almost as if she were spooked or rabid, she busted through the screen door and began barking and snarling at the front door.  At that point I ran into the bathroom and pullled my husband from the shower with my hysterics about what my daughter and I were seeing outside.  By the time my husband got the soap out of his eyes and a towel on him, we ran out to the front yard where the object still was brightly illuminated in our driveway, when the lights separated into three discs and sped off at at a rate of speed that most conventional airplanes could do and at what appeared to be a 45 degree angle.  You could see a vapor trail of where they left because it was partly cloudy with the moon behind my house which is located in a southwesterly direction.  When the police arrived, some of my neighbors came out to ask me if I had seen or heard anything because their dogs were going nuts and my daughter and I explained what we had seen.  But my daughter saw it first so I have no idea of where they came from or how they descended to tree level.  I think the sheriff&apos;s deputy thought my child and I were crazy, but my ex-husband who really didn&apos;t get a good look at anything too much agreed that my child and I definitely saw something, particularly convincing was the fact that our dog busted through our screen door and didn&apos;t calm down until ten minutes after the lights disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The driveway we were pulling out of was directly across the street from a place called Ralphs funeral home. We were looking west. As we started to pull out we looked directly in front of us and above the funeral home was an oval shaped craft. it was hovering about 5 feet, over the funeral home.I seem to remember it making a very soft humming noise. It had very small colored lights under it. It was moving extremely slowly. I remember thinking if I got out of the car I could walk under it at the same speed it was moving. It was about one and a half times the size of the building aproximately 70 or 80 feet in length.I was absolutely not a hot air ballon or blimp. I asked her if she saw it. She said yes.

A call came in from two witnesses who were sitting in their car at English Bay, British Columbia. They reported that they were watching three unusual objects and giving me the description over the phone as they observed them. The witness said she was watching the objects through her binoculars and said the one object was huge and the other two a lot smaller. The large object was circular in shape, bright white and filled with what she described as darker dots. In the center of the object there was nothing, or one would be able to see through it. The object was also rotating and had two smaller objects flying around it. One of the crafts was reported to be triangular in shape and the other again more circular. The triangular craft would move a distance away from the larger object, makes sudden turns and at times they were able to observe the full triangular structure and at other times see if being flat. The smaller circular object would travel around the triangle shaped object and also move around the circumference of the larger object. The witnesses were facing west when observing the three objects and added that whatever these things were .. they seemed to be at a good distance from them. The skies were completely clear.

Several miles off in the distance on the horizon I noticed somthing was moving, I wasnt sure but there was a mountain that I could use as a refrence point. A light was moving up, down and sidways. When it would get close to the ground, it looked like lightning or electricity was being discharged from it, then it would shoot up in the air a good distance and start gyrating around like an angry bee, great big loops and zigzags.We all watched for over an hour as it just did the same thing over and over,then got back in our motorhome and went back too Henderson where my brother lived.

We were traveling north on Flamingo Road north of Griffin Road near Fort Lauderdale, approaching Flamingo Gardens. Noticed a bright orange/red glow, stationary at about 35-40 degrees above the horizon, just above the tree line as seen from the road. Size made it appear to be an aircraft beacon but more orange/pink in color than a red beacon. The other problem is there is no beacon in the vicinity. This &quot;object&quot; was apparently motionless but after about 15 seconds a long tail of &quot;flame&quot; appeared behind the object, indicating that it was entering the atmosphere from the north, thus the bright reddish glow and tail. The tail lasted about five seconds after which the object began to fade steadily and it turned to the east at a high altitude at a rapid speed, that of a fast jet. There were no aircraft style lights or beacons from the object. It faded in intensity after it turned east. This unnerved me since I have never seen anything like this, and the apparent direction was from the north, which would be a strange direction of reentry for a typical spacecraft. I am familiar with meteorites, which at the rate of speed on entry, streak across the sky in about 1 second. This episode lasted the better part of a minute and was obviously not a meteorite. I wonder if you have any information on this episode that you can share. A driver behind me also pulled over to observe this object. Whatever it is, the sight was extremely unusual and compelling.

We had just finished a discussion on Big and Little Dippers and North Star.  As I continued gazing straight up (90 degrees), I noticed a faint &quot;cluster of Lights&quot;.  Two things got my immediate attention.  The amount of lights that were flashing, and the high rate of speed the object seemed to be moving.  The lights appeared to be a &quot;cluster&quot; of lights, perhaps 6-10, and they were flashing, with red being the dominant color.  I watched for approximately 10 seconds.  During that time, the cluster kept flashing and moved across the sky from straight overhead to approx. 45 degrees.  I then pointed the object out to my wife who sighted it and we watched for approx. another 20 seconds until it disappeared due to long range at about 25 degrees on the horizon.  The cluster of lights appeared to be extremely high.  No  sound could be detected. Not knowing the size of the object or the size of the lights, it is difficult to estimate its altitude.  Making an estimate based on what I know about aircraft, sizes, speeds, etc., I estimate this cluster of lights could easily have been between 25,000 and 35,000 feet, or even higher.  The object traveled the entire time in a straight line from North to South.  The cluster of lights did not change relative position on each other, and the craft did not change direction.  I am not aware of any known aircraft that has up to 10 flashing lights on the underside.  As we went to bed later that evening, we listened to &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; on KMJ 580 (Fresno, Ca) and several callers had reported seeing this cluster of lights, also moving North to South, along the East Coast.

At around 12:30 on April 14, 2004 I noticed an odd pair of lights.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but my parents saw it too.  I first noticed it when it appeared that the object was vertical with only 2 corners visible (imagine viewing a triangular block from the side).It appeared to be a very small triangular object with lights on the 3 corners. The lights were round circular and cycled.  To visualize one set of lights, imagine a cross section of a pipe with many lights making the circle.  It was these lights that alternated kind of like christmas lights that look like the electricity is moving through them.  For example, let&apos;s say each set of lights was only made of 3 lights.  Light 1 is on, light 2 and 3 are off.  Then L1 is off, L2 is on, L3 is off.  Then L1 is off, L2 is off, L3 is on.  Then L1 is on, L2 is off, L3 is off.  I wish I could describe it better.  Hopefully the text image below will come out correctly.  You should see 3 O&apos;s portraying the 3 sets of circular light schemes with each O at a corner of an equilateral triangle. O O O  It hovered over the highway for maybe 30 seconds and quickly sped off to the right hand site shoulder behind the overpass.  As I approached the overpass it came speeding back over the high way.  It hovered very low.  It actually passed right in front of my car twice and then hovered off to the left and shined a light (almost like a small white flashlight) right at me from the right hand side.  This light came from one of the sides, not from one of the corners of the object.  It followed me for a little bit and I was going just over 80mph.  Then it crossed over the northbound side again and then went back to the right hand side where it vanished behind the overpass.  I saw it for probably close to a minute or two total but it seems longer. I believe the color was black but i couldn&apos;t quite see it because of the lights.  I basically only saw the lights from it. It may have been some one playing tricks on people because it was a very small object.  Not exactly large enought to hold little green men.  It probably close to 3 or 5 feet in length.  It was definitely not wider than my Civic.  However it had great agility and speed and it was silent. I was definitely not the only person to see this.  Aside from my parents in the same car, there were a bunch of trucks on the freeway at the time.  I did a search on the internet at about 5:30 PM the same day to see if anyone had more info on this and I can&apos;t seem to find anything so I am entering in this info.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I turned around and saw a object high in the atmosphere that was just hovering near to where I was standing. I shone the torch in its general direction and flicked the torch on and off a few times.The object proceeded to descend towards where I was standing. I did start to worry that maybe it was not the best of ideas to try it as you never know...

I was thinking about calling out to my friend and her boyfriend to come and see but I wanted to observe it for as long as I could. I am not sure how it changed but the next moment I saw it had a Pyramid shape and glowed a faint golden colour. I saw 2 spots of light one was red and one was green on the  bottom part of the Ufo.I called out to my friend and by the time she and her Boyfriend had come outside it had moved about 1 kilometre down to near the neighbours house ( Being on a rural property).They both saw it as a series of bright lights zig zagging in the sky.", "Bright object speeded across the skySaw a pretty bright object streak across the sky at a high speed, only visible for a small moment (approx 2 seconds).

Our house was on the corner of ((deleted))th Avenue and ((deleted)) Street.  There was a street light on the corner that I could see sitting on my bed. One night I awoke because of a noise.  I sat up in bed and looked out the window.  There under the street light was a spaceship, there was an opening and small green colored men dressed in silver suits were coming out of the opening and there were a few more already on the ground walking in front of the spaceship. My first thought was to run tell my parents or brothers but I was too scared and fascinated to move.   My sister slept in the same room as I did and I tried to wake her but she only turned over and continued sleeping. I watched them  for a long time.  I was worried that they might come into the house.  We never locked our doors and it would be easy for them to just walk in.  I wanted to get up and at least lock the doors but I was too uneasy.  I don&apos;t remember what happened afterwards because I didn&apos;t see them take off or get back in the spaceship.  When I woke up in the morning they were gone and I had an uneasy feeling that something had happened. I know it sounds crazy, but it really did happen. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had been dating for about one year. I was 18 and he was 17.  He was coming out to my parents farm (2+ Mi. from town)to see me at around 9p.m..  He was driving a small Bridgestone motorcycle and was less than 1 mile out from town (where he lived, and almost to the Burlington Northern RR tracks when he sensed something above him.He looked up and a round craft was directly over him at around 100 ft. in the air.  It was not very large in size, completely circular, and had green lights, red lights and some yellowish lights on the bottom.  There seemed to be some sort of lines in the bottom, like spokes in a wheel look.  It was making a low humming sound that resonated. It was almost pitch dark so he couldn&apos;t see the color of the craft.He immediately tried to accelerate the bike to get away from it because he was absolutely terrified and realized that he was staying in one place in the road, even though the bike was still running and it seemed that the tires were still moving.  He had driven that road so many times throughout his life and knew every bump in it.  He realized later that during this initial few seconds that if he were still driving fast like he had been before seeing the craft he would have already been past the RR tracks. He remembered cranking the accelerater real hard and the bike didn&apos;t speed up.Then he doesn&apos;t remember anything AT ALL until suddenly he was back on his bike in almost the same spot, with the bike moving, only he was going real slow, like 25mph, instead of 65mph from before.  He proceeded to come to see me and never mentioned a thing to me or anyone else.From my vantage point, I was waiting at the farm and watching the clock, excited to see him and couldn&apos;t figure out why he was late.  He had called me right before he left town and should have been to my place in 5 minutes.  Instead he arrived in about 25-30 minutes later.  I asked him what took him so long and he acted really weird. I noticed that he looked pale and was quiet all nite.  In fact I noticed a change in his personality from then on but kept it to myself.Then, about a month or so after that when we were out on a date, we talked about going and parking at a radio tower near town where all our friends went (lover&apos;s lane kinda spot).  We had been there before.  So we went there and were sitting for a few minutes when he freaked our and said he had to leave the spot, then proceeded to tell me what had happened with the UFO. Before that he had made fun of me because I believed they existed. I know this isn&apos;t my story to tell. I also know that the experience impacted my life almost as much as his and I feel it is important to tell you about it. I don&apos;t remember the date or time, but gave a guess. I was and still am amazed at how terrified he was and remained so for many years.We are no longer married and as far as I know he refuses to talk about it. I think he pushed it out of his conscious mind. At the time, though, I told several friends and family members and he talked about it a couple of times to them, also.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This object traveled across approximately 90 degrees of visible sky before I lost it behind ground clutter. The best description I can give would be a plastic coat hanger with the hook at the top removed, leaving a flattened triangle with rounded corners. It appeared to be either clear like acrylic with many small lights inside, or perhaps a light gray that matched the background sky color with a highly reflective surface in which case the many small lights may have been reflections of ground lights. I have been an aviation buff for most of my life and this was no aircraft I have ever seen. While the shape was reminiscient of a hanglider there was no &quot;swooping motion&quot; typical of &quot;kites&quot;. Since there was no sound it couldn&apos;t have been an ultralight either,they use very noisy small engines and this was silent. The movement was straight and level so must have been powered flight. the size at arm length appeared to be about three inches wingtip to wingtip and about one inch nose to tail. While I can&apos;t say the exact distance from me I have the impression this was about the size of a small private aircraft which would give it an altitude of a few hundred feet, certainly low enough to hear engines or see someone hanging below a hanglider. Speed would be hard to estimate, but it only took five or six seconds to cross my line of sight, much faster than any private plane.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They were too high to be ship lights and too active to be stars...they moved up and down, sometimes going quite high, sometimes hovering just above the water. We watched them through high powered binoculars as they shifted left, then right, then up and down. They would come closer and suddenly move a great distant away again at an extremely fast pace (in almost a flash.) I forgot to mention, one was a reddish orb, the other a green one and both approx. same size - although the green one seemed slightly smaller at times (maybe farther away?) Out of the brighter, reddish orb a smaller white glowing orb appeared to come out of it and circle around it, then float beside it for a time, then go back inside. We watched this happen for almost two hours when below on the beach, a man was walking alone and we watched him stop and observe the moving lights.

I turned around and ran back to my friends and told them it was too scary, they had to come too.  We walked towards the lights, to within 20 yards and they appeared to take the shape of trucks backing out and pulling around.  One of my friends said, &quot;They&apos;re just trucks.&quot;  My other friend said, &quot;yes, they kind of look like trucks.&quot;  At that moment I turned around and heard a sound behind me, and when I turned back around my friends were gone, the lights were gone, and I was 1 1/2 miles from where I had been standing.  I looked at my watch and about 20 minutes had passed.  I was disoriented and could not remember where my truck was, so I just headed towards the water to find it.  When I got back my friends weren&apos;t there, so I went to the hill to see if I could see them, and waited for another 20 minutes or so before they appeared, coming from the opposite direction from where we had been.  When I ran down to them and asked them if they were trucks, they both said, &quot;They weren&apos;t trucks.&quot;  They had run into the middle of the lights and said the last thing they remembered was the lights swirling around them, and then they were 1 1/2 miles from where we were in the opposite direction from where I had gone.

These &quot;lights&quot; were not red or green or white, nor did they ever blink. Aircraft running lights are sometimes hidden by a wing or fin, but even at high altitude the different colors of running lights are distinguishable one from another. Because of the altitude and darkness, there was no way for me to describe shape of objects. These objects were constant - unblinking, color unchanging as they traversed from north to south.

While I do not remember exact date, sighting was within an hour after dark - not once but three consecutive nights. The only difference is on the third night, one of the objects, which from such distance I could only describe as an &quot;orange light&quot; broke off from the &quot;formation&quot; and shot away to the east, while the other two lights continued southward.

There are military operations in this area (and quite active), however this would be the very first time I (or anyone I&apos;ve spoken to) would remember actually being able to see any of it, other than normal flight paths, due to distance.  Not sure what it was, except that it was very bright, much brighter than 4th of July as almost as bright as a full moon on a clear night.  It was near new moon period howerver, which may have made it seem brighter.((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT))This is an update to a previous report, I have since spoken to many more people, including someone else who saw the same exact lights, and have since become certain the lights were indeed military flares as I indicated was likely in the original report.  There were several others who very accurately described what I saw, and claimed they had seem them before, though not this time, but who had been able to determine they were flares.  You can also reference the link in the original report to the other military flare sighting that was similar, which actually led me to this website orginally.

It did not seem to be moving.  We kept our eye on it for several minutes, and it remained still.  We were making trips in and out of the apartment building, and we kept checking on it, trying to frame it at the same spot between a tree and a balcony in order to judge if it was moving.  Unfortunately, we did not see it take off.  We made another trip, and when we came back to the parking lot, it was gone.This event probably lasted 10 - 15 minutes. Another airplane passed above the object during this time. &quot;6:30pm&quot; is an estimate.  We were facing towards the east not far from Union Station.

These lights were steady and formed an obtuse triangle. It was some time after moonset. I heard no noise from them. My binoculars are Nikon 10x.

His dad gave his son my phone number and the man called me and told me of an unusual sighting which he and his wife witnessed this evening. The fellows wife was the first to notice it while the couple were sitting outside of their residence having a cigarette. The sky was completely clear. The object was visible for approx: 20 to 30 seconds before it left the couple line of sight and was certainly a triangular shaped craft. The witness said it was a glowing white in color, no lights were seen on the craft. The man guessed the object was flying at approx: 20,000 feet. Because of how high the craft was and being night time I wanted to make sure how the witnesses came to be able to view the object. This was due to the color of it. They explained that it was extremely bright, but went on to say you couldn&apos;t miss it either. There was no aura or glowing light surrounding it, there was no trail or tail following behind. The witness said he saw no aircraft before or during the sighting, but said right after the object passed by a helicopter was seen flying at a low level shinning it&apos;s spotlight down towards the ground. The craft flew in a straight line towards the northeast over Okanagan Lake. At arms length the witness guessed the object would have been 1 to 2 centimeters in length looking from his location. No sound was heard. The man said the craft was solid in color and not just points of light in a triangular shape.

Here&apos;s one I had years ago and didn&apos;t know where to report it.While walking at night in our small rural town, I was stargazing as I walked and noticed a bright gold light approaching from the south. At first I thought it was a star, but quickly remembered that there are no stars like that in the southern sky and planets are never as low in the sky where I first spotted it. It gave the appearance of Jupiter, all gold and glowing steadily. I think the reason I didn&apos;t think of it as an &quot;moving object&quot; at first was because it was approaching so slowly. Then I noticed the movement against a tree limb. I watched until the light started to elongate, this was due to it&apos;s coming nearer, I don&apos;t believe it changed shape. When it got close enough, I could see that it was a rectangular shape. For some reason I think it decended as it neared the town... My mouth dropped open when I could distinguish two dark, backlit shapes in the &quot;window&quot;. They were human-looking in size and were visible from the waist up. Since the gold light was so strong behind them, I could see no features. Just the shape of heads and shoulders. They were side by side, not quite touching. There was absolutely no noise. There was also no other shape discernable that I can recall. It is strange that I can remember no other details or the exact time I saw this or really how long it lasted. I only remember watching the approach and looking up and being in awe. When the &quot;craft&quot; was almost out of my sight range to the north, I shook my head to clear it, and ran to a nearby gas station to see if anyone else had witnessed what I had. They were closed. I couldn&apos;t find anyone, anywhere! I felt like I was alone in town... I ran back home, which was close and found binoculars but the light, by this time, only looked like a slowly dimming gold dot, in the binoculars. I remember telling my family about this and my Dad told me that he had seen almost the identical thing in Eugene, Oregon, back in the early 70&apos;s, only the window that was lit up on the craft he saw was bluish.

As it was coming closer &amp; passing over me, i could clearly see a metallic shape circling around the sphere at an extremely fast pace, much faster than the sphere itself was moving.

He replied that it could be a satellite (he hadnt been watching it before hand like myself) but as we watched it, it stopped going in a straight direction and raised in altitude on an upward slant as if headed toward space. The object seemed to disapear. I looked around hoping someone else had been looking up, but the 8 or so people there were engaged in conversations with eachother. The guy who i pointed it out to did not seemed phased &amp; just walked back in the bar. I dialed the operator on my cell phone ( i didnt know what else to do) &amp; asked if anyone else called in a sighting of an ! unidentified object over east Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He laughed,so i hung up. Orange sphere flying at an extremely fast speed, metallic object circling around it at an even faster pace. This, i will never forget. Ive never experienced any thing like this, i know what i saw because it was a perfectly clear night, and i will continue from here on forth to search the internet for another reporting of this sighting. If only to get rid of the &quot;how silly am i&quot; feeling.", "transported into another place by unknown, possibly alien contact attempting to show me something.I was in the city of Plano, TX.  I took my dog for the usual walk. I was in an oopen field next to the trailer park where I lived.  On August, 1999 at 12:30 am I was confronted by a 7 ft tall object.  It came and went in front of me.  I turned to go home and again confronted by the object which materialized into a large wolf.  We looked at each other, but he did nothing.  I stood there for while, then turned to return home.  To my surprise, I was in a different place, not in the city anymore, surrounded by Hwy 75, the gas station and trailer park.  I was in a vast, open field which looked like wheat grass.  Night turned to day, and I could see the clouds and trees.  It was like the morning sunrise.  I could hear the grass swishing in the wind.  I was frozen with fear and could not move.  Everything to the right, left and behind me was pitch black.  I turned to go home, and glanced back over my shoulder to find the wolf had disappeared, and everything returned to normal.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and although his story sounded quite bizarre, the witness seemed to us to be quite lucid and objective about the experience.  The date indicated here is approximate, but please see other reports for August 15, 1999, a Sunday, for the dramatic and bizarre immense flash of light that occurred in New Mexico, and surround states.

Pulled off freeway for a while to look at huge object at fixed location in sky.Wasn&apos;t moving as a plane would be, and didn&apos;t appear to be very high up in sky.  I finally drove on after looking at this object for what seemed like a very long time.  Looked like colors were changing, or the object was rotating in fixed position.  I would guess object was only 1000 feet high over area it was hovering.  There had to be other people who saw this,  as it was hovering over a residential  area,  I believe.  Very striking sighting and has puzzled me ever since- my only sighting as far as I know.", "12:02 a.m. A box shaped object with a distinct 45degree[appx.] slope on it&apos;s front,moving at 400 to 500 m.p.h. at a  good 400 feet up .It had on its rear, red and green flashing lights.It had brown irregular vertical stripes on the front side facing me.They looked like they were radiant heat as metal shows under a torch&apos; flame. I only saw the object for a few seconds. I ran inside , grabbed a pen and some paper, to write this down. I called the MADISON CTY.

Madison county.", "Two adults witness boomerang-shaped object during a strange sequence of eventsMy wife and I were headed home after eating dinner at our friends&apos; home.  There are two ways to go home, the short way and the long way.  The long way is only about three minutes longer, but 99 percent of the time, we take the short way.  My wife was driving and for some reason when we came to the point where we could chose between the short and long way, I told her, &quot;take a left, let&apos;s go the back(long) way home.&quot;  Right before we took that left turn, I noticed a small single-engine plane flying S/SE at around 500 to 700 feet.  I could easily see its red and green lights.  Bessemer Municipal Airport is about six miles NW of this location.  This airplane looked like it may have departed from Bessemer due to its altitude. We continued to drive the long way home and I thought to myself, &quot;why did I tell her to go this way?&quot; and &quot;I hope she didn&apos;t mind me telling her to go this way.&quot;  We turned right at Highway 58, going west in Helena when I clearly noticed this big object in the sky with three white lights, the center light being the brightest of the three.  I could see the grayish outline of a boomerang shape, with the bright light in the center and the left and right white lights on the edges of the &quot;wings&quot; of the object.  For some reason I nonchalantly pointed to it and said, &quot;see, things like that.&quot;  I don&apos;t know why I said that.  We had not been talking about seeing strange things.  It was like the whole reason why we went the long way home was to see this thing. When she saw what I was seeing, she stopped the car and asked, &quot;what is that?&quot; and &quot;it&apos;s not moving.&quot;  It wasn&apos;t moving.  It looked like it was stationary in the sky.  The object was about 35 degrees, NW of our location at a range of about 1 mile and an altitude of anywhere from 1000 to 5000 feet depending on the size of this thing.  It was &quot;pointed&quot; in the direction of SE and none of the lights were blinking.  The pure-white aspects of the lights on this thing really stand out in my memory of seeing it.  The center light was as bright as Venus is currently in the evening, and I recall seeing this object and Venus at the same time, with Venus to the left and higher up in the sky, maybe five degrees away.  At an arm&apos;s length, the boomerang-shaped object was about 1-1/2 inches wide and 1/4 inch tall. A car was coming up behind us so we had to start moving down the road.  As we did, I kept my eye fixed on the object.  Intermittently, trees would pass and block the view that I had of the object, but it was still there.  We came to Highway 17 and instead of turning left to go home, my wife turned right to get a better view of this object.  My view was blocked by a gas station and the bright flourescent lights of the outside of the gas station.  When my view was clear again, the object was gone.  We continued to drive north on this road.  Oddly enough, there was a vehicle off the road and in the ditch on the side of the road with its headlights on, but we didn&apos;t see anyone in it.  This distracted us briefly, but it didn&apos;t seem to be a serious accident.  We continued to drive and we saw what appeared to be the object again, but now it was way to the north, about 5-7 miles away, much higher in the sky and what appeared to be headed to the north.  It was now moving away from us quickly and we soon lost sight of it over the northern horizon(toward Birmingham). We drove through a subdivision on our way back home, driving slowly to see if we could notice the object once more, but we never saw it again.  We circled around by the forementioned gas station and saw where a police cruiser was arriving on the scene where the vehicle was in the ditch.  We made it home about 90 seconds later where we discussed what we just saw. These questions remain:  What did we see?  How did it move so far away, changing directions and altitude so quickly?  What made us go home that way?  Why did I say what I said when I saw the object?  Did the driver of the vehicle in the ditch see this thing, thus distracting the driver to cause the accident?  I guess we will never know that.  Maybe I am over-thinking this whole thing, but my wife and I know that we saw a large boomerang thing with three lights floating stationary over Helena, AL for at least 10 seconds that night. Weather at the time: skies were clear, the air temperature was in the 50&apos;s(F) and there was a light northerly breeze.", "At first it was noticed when a plane flew by. Then after the plane was gone we noticed a flashing light that appeard to be moving back and forth. Of course nothing was thought of it until it stayed in the same spot. There were colors that were flashing from it. They were in a pattern of red, blue, then yellow or white. Again this object kept moving side to side. I ran and got my cam corder and was able to capture this on film. It started becoming smaller and withen minutes was just gone. I am not saying that I witnessed a UFO but I know it was no aircraft that our goverment lets us know they have the technology for. If any one can help us clarify this it would be greatly appreciated. Also, during the time I was recording this, my husband was taking pictures with our digital camera at the sky; just to see if any thing would show up. These pictures are remarkable and they, as well, are not of any pictures I have ever seen. Thank you for tacking the time to read this. I hope youcan help us understand.", "Chrome colored object in western sky.Not sure if this is the right thing to do, but here it is.Ever since I witness this strange object on March 29th 2004, I have had many strange things happen. The evening was partly cloudy, and windy, and unusually warm, so I went outside to see the sunset and have a cigarette. While looking to the west at the sunset, I noticed a chrome ball in the sky, and I immediately dismissed it as an airplane coming towards me. After several minutes of watching this object, I decided to run in the house and get my video camera to film this, in case it was a UFO. After I came back out side, the object had moved to the north, but still hovering over what looked like the Oakland area. As I started filming the object, it swiftly maneuvered towards my location. As it passed me directly overhead, roughly the height of the high clouds, it disappeared. It made no noise as it went overhead, and I could then see the object was oval or roundish, about half the size of a large airliner. I went into the house and turned on the TV news and my radio, to listen if somebody else witnessed this. Nothing was reported on the stations I selected. As I listened to the news, I hooked up my video camera to the other TV to see the video, which I was expecting to remarkable. I rewound the tape, and pressed play, and nothing appeared but fuzz. Now I had goosebumps all over my body. Something happened to the tape. The entire tape was dead, just fuzz. Then I started thinking, maybe this thing knew I was taping it and that&rsquo;s why it flew overhead, but I still to this day cannot figure out why the whole tape is messed up. Here&rsquo;s where the fun begins. A day after this event (which has dramatically altered my life) I notice items in my patio missing. An old electric keyboard is gone, and so was my fishing equipment. I quickly dismissed this as a neighborhood kid theft, but then I started noticing other things missing too. My hair brush, my dirty laundry, my tooth brush, and even some old video tapes that I used to record my friends wedding the week before. I am the only person who lives here, except for my pet Doberman, who is very old, and semi-senile. The next part of this might freak you out, as it did to me, and to this day I am afraid to sleep. The following two nights after the sighting, I heard noises in my garage, which is adjacent to my bedroom. Through the walls, I head movement and rattling noises, and what sounded like voices, but squeaky. The third day after my sighting, I decided it was time to check on things in the garage, and swung open the large front door. All of the light bulbs had been removed, but other than that, everything seemed to be in order. Maybe kids? The doors were locked and remained locked, so I&rsquo;m unsure what it could have been. I have decided to move out and sell the house, as I am just too freaked out to stay there, and have been staying at a friends house for a while. i am now worried I might be abducted.If you need to discuss this or see the fuzzy tape feel free to email me. Thanks.", "Bright orange cigar shaped UFO outside of Cleveland, OhioThe object was a bright orangish/yellow color.  When I first noticed it, it stationary.  I remember thinking how odd it was that almost as soon as I noticed it, It began moving horizontally from north to south, and it appeared to be &quot;dancing&quot; up and down slightly.  It was not moving very fast.  When I first saw it, the first thing that came to mind was a blimp at night, only brighter.  It also moved faster than a blimp. Living between Cleveland and Akron, I&apos;ve seen the Goodyear blimp at night returning to Akron after ballgames, and this was not a blimp, but it&apos;s shape was almost identical.I was the first to see the object and when I saw it, I ran inside to get someone to come out and see it.  My sister came outside and also saw it for a short time.  We got into her car and tried to find it again once it was out of sight.  I noticed a man who pulled his car over and was standing outside of it looking in the direction that the UFO was travelling.  I believe that he saw it too. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It took only a few seconds before I lost sight of it. I&apos;ll never forget it as I know it was no plane, blimp or any other air craft I&apos;ve seen before. The height of the object was above tree level how high I couldn&apos;t tell you, but I do know it wasn&apos;t any star, planet etc. either.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The weather was cool, and the sky was blue and cloudless. As I got into my truck, I noticed the moon had just risen in the east and was just above the treeline. I headed west on Interstate 4, then to Interstate 275 which crosses Tampa Bay on the Howard Franklin Bridge. There was an airshow at MacDill AFB that day so I kept glancing to my left (south of the bridge) to see if I could see any interesting aircraft. (To give you some background, I&apos;m 39 years old and have grown up on or around military bases my whole life. My father and ex-husband were both in the USAF and my daughter is now in the USAF. I know many USAF planes by sight and sound.) I was disappointed to see that the only thing in the sky was what looked like a commercial jet from the Tampa Airport, along with it&apos;s contrail. I continued west, enjoying the beautiful sunset. After the bridge, the interstate takes a southern curve so I was out of the sight of the sunset for a few minutes until I headed due west again on the 118th Avenue exit. The sun was not yet touching the horizon when I saw what I first thought was Venus, since it was in the same location that I usually see Venus around 9pm or so. However, this was NOT Venus. It was a very pure white, oval shaped object about 1/2 the size of 1/2 of a full moon. It looked to be over the Gulf of Mexico. It seemed very high in the sky and did not move, it just glowed. At this point I pulled over on the side of the road so I could watch it uninterrupted. As the sun lowered, the object went from an oval to more of a triangle with softened corners. As the last of the sun went below the horizon, the object faded away right before my eyes. Could it be the reflection of something?", "Dark boomerang shaped UFO hovers over MIA airport then flies upward past arriving airlinerI am not the eye witness, but I questioned closely the controller involved. I was an air traffic controller at Miami International at the time this event occured. I came on duty at 10 o&apos;clock am on this day. The whole facility was buzzing so I asked what was going on. The person I asked said that the midnighters had seen a UFO at the airport early..I did not get the full details for several weeks. The controller was obviously upset over what he had witnessed and refused to talk about it. I waited a few weeks for the right time and when it was quiet I asked this controller to tell me the whole story. Bob said that he working the midnight shift and his relief had arrived up in the tower cab as well as a flight data assistant (three total). They were chatting and one them looked up at the tower radar display. Something was quickly moving across the scope from the north and toward the airport. The observer called out and they all started looking out the windows (it&apos;s dark but getting light in the east). To the north something low was covering up the lights on the ground. At this point the UFO is almost over airport. They all saw it as it came to a hover over the commuter ramp, (low, 100 feet or less) which is in the middle of the airport. At this point I stopped the story to ask a question; how big was it? Bob said it was about the size a B-727, which is quite large. He also said that it was dark in color, maybe dark olive. The object hovered over a vehicle and turned on a bright light. There was a ramp person in the vehicle asleep. The ramp vehicles all have radios tuned to the ground control frequency. This person started screaming on frequency for the tower to quit playing pranks. The light stayed on for several minutes. Remember it&apos;s getting lighter outside every minute. The light turned off and it continued to hover. Now it&apos;s light enough to see detail. The object the rises vertically and passes very close to a an arriving Eastern Airlines A-300. The aircraft was coming in from the south and was on downwind and preparing to land. The pilot asked &quot;what the hell was that?&quot; The controllers said that they did not know. The object continued up to many thousands of feet, but still visible fron the ground. At this point two other controllers were driving into work. One was coming in from the south and the other from the north. They both saw the object ascend and watched it until it stopped. When it stopped it stayed motionless for several minutes and then it started to gyrate wildly. While it was gyrating it had many multi-colored lights flashing. The object performed like this for several more minutes. When it stopped it stayed motionless for several minutes and then suddenly went vertically out of sight. In the the tower things were hectic trying to see if the radar room could see anything and getting the airliner on the ground. While taxiing in the pilot asked if the controllers knew anything more and then stated &quot;well I guess I&apos;ve seen one now&quot;. Over the next hour or so &quot;answers&quot; started coming from various agencies, none of which were accepted by the controller witnesses. In the end the FAA told them to say nothing of the event. One final thing, Bob mentioned that for the next couple of hours (no wind) a yellow-green haze was seen to stay in the area where the object was hovering.This event was a catalyst, of sorts, to open a host of stories from other controllers.  All very interesting.You can e-mail or call for more details if you wold like.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Las Cruces lights.It was wednesday before halloween but I don&apos;t remember the date.  I fell asleep about 8:30 and was awakened by a bright light in my room.  At first I thought I had overslept and it was full day but when I woke I realized the light was gone, I looked out the window thinking someone was in the yard putting a flashlight to windows (I lived in a 4plex that was empty except for my unit).  No sign of anyone, then I thought maybe a car had gone down the dirt road behind the complex, but there was nothing.  I was ready to go back to sleep when I saw that it was almost a full moon.  While I was admiring the moon I saw a &apos;star&apos; move from one side of the moon to another, then it was joined by two more.  The three moved together to another part of the sky, then were joined by 6 more.  They did geometric formations, pyramids, triangles, then light shot between them for a few seconds.  Then all but one zipped off.  The one came close and got big, it looked like a sphere with lights stobing around the middle, but I could have imagined that.  It might have been a disk or just a circle of stobing lights.  No way to tell.  It hovered a while and suddenly the lights went dark for a second, then they came back on and a beam of light shot down to the ground.  It was bright white and seemed to have a spiral of brighter light in it (some kind of movement).  It stayed on for a few seconds, went off then on again.  then it went off and the lights left.  There was no sound the whole time.  I looked at the clock and it was 9:00pm.  I remember it fairly well because I wrote it down.  What was weird is that I was usually exhausted because of work and kids and too much to do to ever get enough sleep and I felt like I had a full nights restful sleep.  The next day I called the police and sheriff to see if a helicopter had been in the area or if anyone else had seen anything.  Neither department owned a helicopter and said the military did not have one in the area.  No one had reported seeing any lights.((NUFORC Note:  The Wednesday before Halloween was October 28.

I had saved the two pics but unfortunately you can&apos;t do that with a webcam shot without it automatically refreshing itself. :o(  At least not this webcam. I have already contacted the station to see if they have the still shots by any chance. At any rate, at 12:15 P.M., central/standard time there was a silver disk over Jackson, MS, just to the left of the Standard Life Building (the tallest building in the pic) and about midway up. I&apos;m just really disappointed about this!!! In both of the pics, however, the second one was a refreshed shot with the time labeled at 12:21 P.M., so just minutes later...and in the second pic at 12:21 it was GONE!

So this can&apos;t be due or rain, etc.!", "Cigar shaped object spotted by Canadian teachers in OntarioLast summer my wife and I who are both teachers, were in the backyard enjoying a beautiful afternoon relaxing on the deck.   As we were engaged in conversation, I saw something up in the sky that caught my attention.   It was a perfect day with a clear blue sky, so I know I wasn&apos;t mistaken about seeing this object.  I notioned to my wife who looked up just as bewildered as myself.   In a short distance from us, we could see a cigar shaped silvery looking object that was motionless in the sky.  It clearly wasn&apos;t a plane or some other object that could rationally be described, as it was truly unique to anything we have ever seen.   As we stared at it for a minute or two, it suddenly moved in a darting motion to it&apos;s left, then it darted again quickly to it&apos;s right, and it moved irradically for a another minute or two after that.  Again after a moment, it remained motionless in the sky without any apparent moment.  It was at this moment that after the rush of excitemnt had passed, I decided to get my camera to get a picture of this thing.   However, as fate would have it, it disappeared within the time I had rushed to go into the house.  My wife said that the object left at lightening speed directly upwards into the sky.   I would have wrote about this sooner; however, I was unaware that this site existed.  This is not some fabricated story made up to get attention or publicity; as I simply want to tell those interested that we are obviously not alone.   I also want to say for the record, that this is mt third sighting of a UFO.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "UFO sighting over Bakersfield, CA that lasted for almost an hour!!!!UFO Description: As seen by myself (36 year old graphic designer) and my girlfriend (42 year old events manager) from our apartment balcony - A dramatically moving bluish-white light. Through binoculars we could just make out an oval shape and a slight glowing purple mixed in with the blue. It was like looking at both a star and an oval-shaped, lit, flourescent black-light tube. Duration of sighting: 45 minutes. Direction (best guess): 290 degrees W by NW from our location. Location in sky: 17 - 20 arc degrees above the horizon. Weather: Unusually windy - very gusty. UFO behavior: Zipping, darting, sharp and rounded/sharp sudden changes in flight, lazy zig-zag pattern, abrupt descension and ascension, inverted arcing patterns (opposite of &quot;Falling Leaf&quot;), sudden speed changes, long and short bursts in a direction. All the while a liquid smooth flight that was a testimony to the mastery over gravity. We eventually stopped watching only due to the fact that the UFO had eventually made it&apos;s way far enough North/West that the dust in the air (due to all the winds that evening) made viewing almost impossible at that distance. When we went back inside it could just barely be seen by us but, was still doing it&apos;s thing. We went back outside 10 minutes later and it was still there, barely visible. I went back out alone another 15 minutes later and both the UFO and the gusty winds were completely gone.  Special Note: I have FIVE MINUTES of video footage! Yes it&apos;s your typical &quot;grainy footage/blurry light&quot; evidence BUT, what makes this video stand out is that on three seperate occasions I had a stationary refernce point (power lines, tree tops and a plane that flew by) to be able to campare and signify the UFO&apos;s movements!!!  Opinions: Considering the duration of this sighting (and the fact that the only reason we stopped looking was that the UFO had moved off to another location for others to witness), I still can&apos;t believe at the time of the filing of this report (two days later) that I still haven&apos;t heard anything on the news. May my UFO footage be a testimony to the fact that there can, indeed, be a UFO &quot;right in front of our faces&quot; and no one would even know because most of us are too preoccupied with trivial things and we have forgotten to look up. I feel fortunate to have witnessed two events, now, in my life (first sighting was late November, 1994 in San Jose, CA. I feel even more fortunate that this time I caught it on tape!((NUFORC Note:  We surmised that the witness might have been looking at Venus, but he took strong exception to that suggestion.  We include some of his comments below.  No other sightings reported from this area of the country for the same time and date.   We believe that the description of the location of the anomalous object matches the location of Venus in the night sky, but the witness strongly disputes that fact.  He claims, after the fact, that he could see Venus, as well.  The video would resolve whether there was one, or two bright objects in the northwestern sky.  PD))((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Pardon my bluntness but, IS THIS A JOKE?     I am an amateur astronomer and I know EXACTLY what Venus looks like and I know EXACTLY where it is every evening. Along with - as far as all the other naked-eye planets that can currently be observed - Saturn, then Jupiter and in the Eastern sky, Mars, all seen as of 9:00 p.m. every evening.     Lets say we are up in the sky looking down at the land and setting Venus in the west is in the 12:00 position, making north in the 3:00 position. The UFO would have been between the 1:00 and 2:00 position. Like my report said, about 290&ordm; west by north west. A significant difference in position.     I can imagine you have to be extremely cautious about screening people who think this whole UFO/Contact subject is a joke and I can respect that but, please DO NOT treat me like half of the populace on this planet (opinions may vary) - too uneducated to know the difference between a planet and a street light.     I have video evidence, I mentioned that in my report. All someone has to do is view the footage I shot and the evidence is clear. Three times I caught the UFO on tape flying &quot;next to&quot; (as seen on a one demensional screen) stationary objects. These three objects were across the street from my location so it&apos;s not like I could just move the camera around to make a stationary object in the sky look like it was moving around. I have the UFO flying behind POWER LINES, around TREE TOPS and sharing the same section of sky while a PLANE FLEW BY.     God, almighty! I take the time to try and share my experience with the organizations that can benefit from this (one problem has always been a lack of proof) and I actually HAVE some proof that can help support and legitimize this highly controversial subject and I get the typical Project Blue Book treatment. &quot;You saw Venus&quot;     I don&apos;t mean to be rude or disrespectful, Peter, but, REALLY. You know darn well the description of the movements of the UFO in my report doesn&apos;t even come CLOSE to describing Venus or any other planet. Nor did it look or behave like any type of plane, helicopter, balloon, remote controlled object (which still has to obey the laws of physics as the big objects like a jumbo jet and can&apos;t turn on a dime), flare, meteorite, fireball, comet, satellite, the International Space station or any kind of bird, bat, or owl.     This is VERY frustrating and I could understand when I had my first sighting in San Jose back in &apos;94 why very few believed me. Evidence is key. Otherwise you hear, &quot;Do you live next to an airport? Di dyou have anything to drink tonight?&quot; That is why I bought my $1500.00 digital camcorder two years ago.

I saw what appeared to be an oval shaped object wrapped or swaddled in a somewhat goldish, metallic material.It was a week night in September of 1976. My Daughter M had just started kindergarten. I was married to B. We were living in a little house&nbsp;on Seminary Dr. in St. Paul, MN. We had gone to bed about 9:30, as we usually did on week nights. It was probably several hours later when I woke with a start to find that B was not in bed with me. This would not have been unusual except that he had to work the next morning.I walked through the house&nbsp;stopping&nbsp;to check on M, who, was missing from her bed. While B being gone was not much cause for concern, he would never, on the longest day of his life, have taken a 5 year old with him.I began to panic. I ran to the back door with the intention of looking to see if our van or car were gone, when I opened it there was a green haze or fog which was quite thick. My dog ran out into the yard, I screamed for him to come back which he did.My panic turning into terror, I picked up the phone but put it back down. Who would I call, and what would I tell them? That my Daughter and Husband were missing, and my house was enveloped in a green fog? Right.I went to the kitchen sink, which was clear of dishes, and splashed my face with cold water in a vane attempt to compose myself. I got a glass of water, drank it and put the glass down on the right side of the sink.At this point I was snot nosed and sniveling. I paced the length of our small house repeatedly, stopping to look in M&apos;s room. Was I having some sort of bizarre psychotic&nbsp;episode, or was this just a terrible nightmare? Yes, the Granddaddy of all nightmares. With this in mind I went back to bed. I lay there in a sweat, with my eyes tightly shut,&nbsp;saying to myself, between&nbsp;heaving sobs,&nbsp;&quot;This is just a bad dream, this is just a bad dream&quot; At some point I noticed that the lights were on in my bedroom. I didn&apos;t recall turning them on. Our security light and the corner street lamp provided more than enough illumination to see most everywhere&nbsp;in the house.I looked down toward the end of the bed and to my horror saw what appeared to be an oval shaped object wrapped or swaddled in a somewhat goldish, metallic material.I opened my mouth to scream. Nothing but a wheezing whimper would pass my lips. Truly frozen with fear, I was pumping adrenaline at a rate I thought might kill me. My heart wasn&apos;t beating, it was buzzing.Some time passed before I was able to move one of my feet, very slowly, out of the fetal position to push this object further away from me.I don&apos;t remember a thing after that until daylight when I awoke to find that B was in bed beside me. I raced to M&apos;s Room where she lay sleeping peacefully. As I walked back to the bedroom I glanced at the sink. There was&nbsp;my glass, on the right side. The light in the bedroom was off. I glanced in a mirror and noticed my face appeared sunburnt. At breakfast I could see that M and B looked sunburnt too. I recall thinking to myself that it had been cloudy and cold all week.I pushed this incident&nbsp;to the back of my mind&nbsp;in a category all it&apos;s own&nbsp;labeled &quot;Nightmare like no other&quot; and went on with my life.A few years later as I sat in a Dentist&apos;s waiting room (in San Diego) paging through a magazine, I noticed an article that pretty nearly described my ordeal. Intrigued, I stopped&nbsp;at a book store on my way home. As I&nbsp;looked through the books on UFO&apos;s and the like I came across some&nbsp;drawings of odd looking, supposed, human/alien infants. One was of a red haired baby wrapped in an oval shaped goldish colored blanket.Looking back on the events of that night, I wish that I hadn&apos;t been so fearful and that I would have closely examined that oval shaped object.Anyone out there had a similar experience? If so I would like to hear from you.Thanks, R((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was driving from one housing area to another on midnights in an isolated area. I saw a light headed straight for the ground at a high rate of speed. Even though it was moving too fast and was far away I believed it was a helicopter or plane crashing. I was at an aviation base and had recently had a helicopter go down. I came to a stop in the middle of the road hoping it wasn&apos;t going to be a crash. The object did a 90 turn and shot back out and disappeared in a matter of seconds.

Photos of the marks on the man&apos;s body can be found at:  Also, last night my brother had new marks on his back. Pictures attached, as well as a mark or scar behind his left ear. He has NO memory of getting them. No nausea, no pain, he was looking in the mirror when he noticed them. They&apos;re are more on his back now. If you compare the pictures I sent you before, you will see the difference. I don&apos;t know why they would focus on my brother&apos;s spine, but he was in a motor bike accident when he was sixteen. He is now 22 this month. He swerved to avoid a dog and hit a tree. He wasn&apos;t wearing his helmet and ended up in a coma for two months. He has mobility in his left leg, but not much control over it. His left hand still spasms. He had nerve damage. He walks with a pronounced limp. I wonder what they are doing to him.

The object, exhibiting a few different bright colors, seemed to stop, hover, then move up and down before disappearing completely.  The unacceptable movements of the craft are what keep me so skeptical.  A westchester county newspaper the following business day reported that a stealth bomber was on routine post 9/11 patrol lit up for Christmas.  I, however, cannot believe this report as again, the craft was moving in such ways that cannot be explained by our modern day aircraft.

I yelled to my mother and went on a run to our front porch with my mother right behind me. She yelled to the neighbors who yelled to more until a crowd of us were glued to the disk in the sky. It was low for such a craft. Our house was on a hill. It was east of our house (beyond the now existing freeway) and positioned at 11:00 in the sky. It was standing still, then it would wiggle, at which time the sun would shimmer off it&apos;s silver shape. This behavior repeated itself in the one spot for many minutes. Suddenly it went North in a blink of an eye and was GONE, out of sight. We all were speechless. I estimate the time as to the big tree on our neighbors yard. We could see through the branches and the placement of the sun was southern in mid-day. I have gone back to view this place to be as accurate as my childish memory will allow. It also was in the Post Intelligencer newspaper the next day. I have wanted to find a copy of that photo. We just stared and never thought of a camera when we viewed this silver disk visiting our sky.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "The object at times looked like funnel shape.

N-S.I hesitate to even report this at this late date - but for the request on CoastToCoast AM last night. Needless to say my memory is very, very skechy now. I was out in the street with several other friends, after sunset but before dark (at dusk) when this craft &apos;appeared&apos; in the sky above. [I don&apos;t recall who first sighted it, or name(s)] Aside from not even being sure if it was in 1947 or &apos;48, much less, the month and day, or if it was more cheveron shaped or a triangle - but memory favors cheveron (I would have said boomerang shape then). The things that do stick in my mind are that it was moving slowly, with no sound audible. In addition, there was a blue glow all around the edges of the craft, which I think was grey or dull metallic color. It appeared to be about the same size as the moon appears when near the zenith, maybe a bit larger.Sorry, I don&apos;t even recall how it actually dissapeared from view -- we may have been watching for a long enough time to exceed our/my teen-age attention span. I do seem to recall that it was traveling parallel to the street we were on, which ran in a north-south direction.

I was scared, I rushed inside to tell my family and when they came out it, it was bigger then ever.  The sound was like a train coming straight for us.  At least 5 minutes passed and then it just vanished.  Out of my eyes it was gone.  I am going to keep everyone updated on this if I see it again.  I&apos;m going to try to get it on the news and hopefully more people saw it.", "Saucer spotted near Rocklin CA in clear, mid-morning. Observed for 20 minutesApproximately 10am I noticed what I first thought was a helicopter hovering above but became curious when I didn&apos;t hear any sound. As I further observed it, the movements were not what one would expect from a helicopter. At that point I told my girlfriend to come out and observe what I was seeing. I didn&apos;t tell her what I thought it was... and she excitedly said it was a UFO. You could see the glint of the sun shine off of it as it turned various directions very slowly. It did not make any quick directional changes, but did appear to slowly turn and at times got verticle to our viewpoint showing that it was definitely saucer shaped. We got my binoculars and observed it for about 15 more minutes as it got further away. The only explanation outside of it being a UFO would have to be that it was an extremely large, saucer shaped mylar balloon. The coloring was either gray or silver. Difficult to tell at the distance it was from us. My girlfriend did take several pictures with her digital camera, but of course it only appears as a dot in the images.", "Two lights brighter than Jupiter, one above the other, suddenly disappeared.While reviewing the more recent reports, I noticed a report of &quot;anomalous lights&quot; seen in Renton, WA, on 03/28/04.  My 16 year old daughter and I also observed these lights.  I was setting up my telescope in our front yard to observe Saturn when my daughter asked me to look at two stars behind us.  I turned around (facing NNE)and saw through the trees what I thought were two very bright stars, one above the other, very near to Polaris in the sky. The apparent magnitude of both was brighter than Jupiter.  I began to reposition my telescope away from the tree branches and when I turned both stars were gone.  My daughter reported that they both had just &quot;vanished&quot;.

The object was easily visible from near perfect sky. Thinking that the object was perhaps a cargo plane, I banked to the left lane and immediately ask my passenger if there was any air traffic in the vicinity other than the object. The reply was negative. As I completed the lane change, the unknown object suddenly appeared at my 1 o&apos;clock position (no more than a mile away) to change shape. And it was definitely not a cargo plane. The upper section, not concealed by any cloud, was gray, and on the lower section there appeared to be one or two reflective bright silver panels. The object was approximately 13 to 15 meters in diameter. Suddenly it accelerated and vanished from what I believe was a slow moving position. We gave chase but the object was gone.

At this point, I noticed another object flying around.   At first I thought it was a plane that was far off in the distance but then it dipped below the ridge in the distance and I realized that it was not that far away.   I was a clear delta or Chevron shape that was a deep black in color.   It was extremely small in size, perhaps no larger than a small car.I watched this object buzz across the valley and then make a turn back around and head back over the valley.   It circled again and then took off at a tremendous rate of speed, much faster than any other object that I have ever witnessed.   At this point, I realized that I had seen something that is quite unusual.Part of me believes that this object could be some sort of drone that is used for the security of our VP Dick Chaney who has a house in the area.   The only thing that would make me waver from this conclusion is the rate of speed of the object.   It literally went from one end of the valley to the other in less than a second, much much faster than any other planes that I watched earlier in the week.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I was about twelve or thirteen years old and my younger brother and I were washing and waxing the car and boat, which we did every summer before going to the lake to water ski.  After finishing I went inside the house then my brother came in excitedly telling me there was a UFO outside and I thought to myself, &quot;Yeah, right!&quot; thinking he was messing with me.  I reluctantly went out and looked up into the sky where he was pointing and saw a perfectly shaped silver pyramid floating about ten or fifteen feet above the power line next to our driveway (only forty or so feet from where we were standing).  The pyramid was about five or six feet tall, had four sides, three of which were dull silver and the fourth which reflected the sun in our eyes every time that side of the object turned our way.  The object was heading East at a leisurly pace and we could walk to keep up with it.  After becoming fairly confident it wasn&apos;t going to jet off I ran inside to tell my parents and ask them to get the camera (we had a fairly strict family and I wasn&apos;t allowed to touch my dad&apos;s camera) but my mom thought I was joking so I ran back outside to watch the object slowly move across the sky.  About fifteen or so minutes into observation the object simply vanished.  Over the years I&apos;ve tried to find out if others have seen the same thing but have found only a few marginally similar reports.

The lights were white. I pulled over on the side of the road to watch it. After about a minute, maybe a little more, it moved a few blocks west pretty rapidly, still at the same height. Then came right back just as fast to the origional location. When this happened, I got scared and put the car in gear to drive again.

I have been watching planes and the contrails they leave in the sky for about two months since I have read about them in some reports. The one that catches my interest I can describe as one circular telescoping  puffy cloud leaving two wide apart thin streams twisting like dental floss before they disappear. I made a report about the cloud fist that opened podlike and  an elliptical disc circle the area. The cloud was tube like and elongated to the opening pod. Before the pod opened there was an intense whiter color. I saw last night about 15 degrees above the western horizon a puff of smoke with the two wide apart contrails following, descend at about 40 degree angle. In the binos I saw the contrails turn black, and the puffy tube cloud turning burgundy red with the head of the cloud a little intenser color. As it descended by a thin cloud I could see no plane in front of the &quot;smoke &quot;or contrails. The whole burgundy red cloud stopped, elongated &quot;wormlike&quot; with the head flattening out disc shape. It began to descend a little more,straightened horizontally, and the whole thing disappeared. Thank you to the witness for the report.

I observed two objects crossing the sky from east to west at a height we normally see a commercial jet fly. When I first observed them there was a considerably gap between the two craft. As the objects passed over me the gap closed and they were side by side until they were out of sight. The objects were reddish orange in color, no blinking lights, but like a continuous light outlining the craft. The objects were triangled shape and moved at a very high rate of speed.", "night time sighting of triangular shaped object or lights moving quickly on clear nightClear night with many stars visible when I noticed a triangular pattern moving from south to north with no sound.  Unable to note structure of object but it was moving silently at about the speed of a small aircraft unable to determine altitiude. Light of triangle was constant but dim. I am an aviation buff so I know what navigation lighting looks like and this wasn&apos;t your ordinary nav lights.  The city of Costa Mesa is near the coast so at first I thought they might just be three ballons floating on the onshore breeze and maybe that&apos;s all it was except the triangular pattern was constant and I would expect ballons in the wind to change positions.  Second of all this object was moving more rapidly than I have ever seen a party ballon move.  I observed a nearby flag ploe immediatley after the sighting and there was absolutley no wind if any.  Now maybe there was wind at a higher altitude pushing this object on shore, but for me it was the constant shape with the quick pace and no wind that interested me. The object also veered off to the east and out of sight during the 20 or 30 seconds it took to move almost directly overhead.  I was wondering if anyone else may have witnessed something similar that evening in my area. I also noted heavy air traffic with a military helicopter coming from the west,  commercial aircraft on approach (757) coming from the east into Long Beach or LAX and another small aircraft to the North along with a police helicopter working off to the East.", "((NUFORC Note:  Date of described event is approximate.  PD))Childhood abduction and mental and visual encounters through out life.When I was 8yrs old I went for a walk in the woods in the mountains in Colorado.  There I had an encounter.  I disappeared for hours. When I returned home, I remembered some of it but not all.  When I tried to talk about it my parents just said I had an imagination.  In 1985 I went to a hypnotist, and had him take me back.  All my life everything kept coming back in dreams and thoughts.  By 1985 I was in tears most of the time. I couldn&apos;t get them out of my mind.  Also throughout my life I had other sightings, tetepathic messages sending me places, and some times others with me and saw what I saw. After my sessions with the hypnotist, I remembered.  And knew I wasn&apos;t crazy.  I remember standing under the ship, it cast a circular shadow, and I could see the sun shining on the ground around it and in the trees. I don&apos;t exactly remember entering the ship, but I remember being on a moveable table or something.  There was a small being walking besides me.  He didn&apos;t scare me, actually I felt safe as long as he was there.  I remember going down a corridor oddly shaped, with light that seemed to come from the walls.  I remember going past an area that looked like somekind of control area. It was all high tech, smooth, and hard to describe.  I drew pictures of everything I could remember, including the panel boards of sorts.  The small being with the very large eyes was still with me.  Then I remember passing an area with floating spheres and another type of a being.  Very tall, bald, large head,large eyes, but not as large as the small being.  I called them the Elders, they seemed so intellegent, and aware.  Then before I entered another area I saw another being, whom I will never forget.  He was humanoid, and very impressive.  I felt very safe.  When I entered the area, there was a baby, maybe about one.  It was sitting on a table, then a large transparent amber colored round flat object dropped down in front of it.  The baby was startled, but calmed down when it stopped in front of it.  It ha! d two arms on the side of it that controled its decsent, and was secured from above.  It had areas in it that were indented, I drew a picture, it is easier to see than to explain.  Then they stopped me next to a girl that was laying on a table.  She had a clear thing kinda domed over her head.  She just laid there. I can&apos;t remember too much until awhile later when I was placed in an area with others.  The area was darker than the areas I&apos;d been in, and the ceiling had lights on it.  The whole ceilins and lights rotated and in the middle the lights were pulsing.  after being in there, I couldn&apos;t remember much.  It is as if they tried to erase my memory.  They did a lot of it, but somehow, I was able to remember some, and sub-conciously I retained a lot of memory.  I tried to tell people, and my parents, but no one would take me seriously.  T%hey just thought I had a big imagination.Anf throughout my life I kept encountering them.  Sometimes I&apos;d see the ships by myself, and at other times there would be other people with me, so I knew it wasn&apos;t my imagination.  Now that I am grown and have kids of my own I am scared.  I have 6 children, and one night 5 of them were with a babysitter, in Gonzales, Lousiana.  I went out to eat with a friend.  While eating I got this real uneasy feeling, and told my friend I had to get home right away.  We doggie bagged our dinner and left. When I got home the babbysitter was screaming, the kids were all talking and excited. After calming everyone down,I asked the sitter what happenen.  She said that my daughter A had come in to say that there were lights in the sky outside.  So everyone went out to see.  When the lookede the lights were gone, then they saw it.  An object of sorts hoovering about 25 feet above the house.  Silent, no sound, and strangely no lights. Just a dark object, that you could see the shape.  My daughter R. ran into my shop and hid under my tee-shirts on the rack.  The babysitter said she tried to get the rest of the kids back into the house.  She said s! he got them in for a moment but they ran out again.  They said I came home just as the object left.  She was my friend, but didn&apos;t come back to my house for a year.  It really scared her. And made believers of my children.  I don&apos;t know what I would have done had I been home at that time.  Why did they come?  What do they want?  And why when I see them, do I feel some kind of a connection with them?  They are strange, yet not strange, alien yet not alien.  I don&apos;t know what they did to me when I was younger, nor do I understand how they can get into my head.  I mean, one time they told me to go to Giant Rock Airport in the desert of California.  I heard them in my head all day.  My husband told me to just go. I ended up with 4 other people and we went to the desert.  There all five of us watched a ship in the sky, moving all over the place.  Now I had witnesses, I was not alone.  Then once I disappeared for hours.  I was only going to the store.  I had taken my (black) kitten with me. when I got  home, I told everyone that I had seen a ship, but I didn&apos;t know I had been gone very long.  But it had turned my black kitten into a black and white kitten.  There were white hairs all over it.  And I don&apos;t remember anything except seeing the ship.  Yet it had been hours, and to me only moments.  And the kitten was my proof.  Everyone at the house saw it.  That was a good calling card.  Now, I don&apos;t know what the future has in store for me and the children who now are adults, and know that something else is going on, that none of us understand.  Maybe someday we will find out why, if they ever return.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

I got up to do my paper route with my friend who was staying the night. I went out to get the news papers when out of the corner of my eye two bright lights to the north above my tree caught my eye. I quickly got my friend and we looked at them for a few seconds until we went in to roll papers. On the route we kept looking at the crafts dismissing them as Venus or stars,along the way they began to move in sparatic patterns nearly missing each other. We were amazed. And when we were nearly done with the route the crafts got closer apearing to be cylinder shaped with a clear to yellow light in the center of the crafts that was fading brighter to dimmer.

I was driving on Hwy 35 just outside of Lindsay, Ontario when I spotted the object about 45 degrees from the horizon in the eastern sky at very close range. It was about the size of a blimp, just a little smaller and a little thinner. It was metallic grey and there were no windows. I would have never noticed it except there was lightning that went from the ground up which caught my eye. Then there was another burst of lightning, again from the ground up when I saw that it was going towards this object. It was a grey cloudy drizzling day and the object was halfway hidden by a cloud. This was strange because clouds thick enough to hide an object at so close a range could not do so. It was as if the object was deliberately hiding from view behind a cloud that could not be there. What was even more strange was I felt my mind go sort of foggy and I was having difficulty hanging on to the image and the memory only second after I saw it. A friend told me afterwards that other UFO sightings had been reported in Peterborough (a near by town) that same afternoon.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

After traveling through an area in which contrail activity seemed suddenly elevated, I used the knowledge gained from a sighting I had, which I reported to this site, last month(3/31/04), to search the sky for unknowns.I spotted what I thought was Venus, except that it was brighter than I have seen before.  We were at 35,000ft. (our Captain reported this as our altitude) so this object was, in my amateur opinion, at about 50-60,000ft.It was either at a stand-still or was moving very slowly, because we passed it within a couple of minutes.  Our flight was steady, and we did not bank in any way at any time during the sighting(any banking would have been noticable because of the distant cloud cover providing a horizon-line for comparison).  This seemed important because the object moved from the front left of my view, slightly rising then lowering,then moving to the right, and then out of my view.To the naked eye, it appeared as a bright, bluish-tinted orb.  It seemed reflective and was much brighter than the surrounding sky.I was able to get off one shot with my camera, before my camera&apos;s battery died.Upon reviewing the shot, when I returned home, one can see that it appears more like a cigar than an orb.  I thought that what I had done was take a picture of another plane, and it being so far away it&apos;s detail isn&apos;t easily noticed.  But I have issues with this.First of all, I was viewing a large number of air craft on the entire flight, and every single one of the other planes left some type of contrail.  This craft left nothing that I could see, either at the time of the sighting, nor in the photo.Secondly, it was much higher than we were(as I said, we were at 35,000)and was moving much slower if at all, leading me to the question of what kind of plane would fit this descrption(i.e., SR-71 or U-2 for instance).  Not that some other more &quot;ordinary&quot; jet aircraft couldn&apos;t fly at that altitude for what-ever reason, but, again, it was barely moving.I am submitting the photograph, in it&apos;s original size, at 916kb, so as to keep it as close to the original as possible.I had to angle the camera up at approx. 45 degrees, and it was zoomed in to the max, 3Xs.

The object seemed to be climbing at first than seemed to stall / perhaps even sliding backwards for a few seconds - then the object seemed to simply disolve in the air... The reason for looking up was the excess amount of air-traffic... This location is at Luke Air Force Base and it is usual to see a few fighter jets in the air... but on the 6th of April the traffic was excessive and the noise cause us to look up.  The object at first glance appeared to be at about 10,000 ft a extrememly bright shinny finish.  The fighter jets in the area all had a dark grey-black appearance. My first thought was that the object was a fighter climbing at a very steep angle but after ten seconds or so I remarked that -&quot; whatever he doing doesn&apos;t look right&quot; I thought it might be one of the fighters about to do a hammerhead stall - then the shape told me this is not a fighter.  It disappeared - as if it had vaporized...The fighter jets were at about 5,000 ft - not as high as the object.

It first turned bright red then blue then green, and orange then all the colors of the rainbow. Then it doubled in size and turned bright red again.

And you could see the triangle shape on these.  My impression was that this was some sort of airforce practice run.

I am inferring that the object between the lights was solid and triangular, because when the object banked North, the angular relationship between the lights was consistent with the banking of an aircraft - however this was no ordinary aircraft. It moved completely silently and covered half the horizon, that is from Surrey to the North Shore Mountains in about four seconds. I am guessing the altitude (based on watching approaching aircraft in the same airspace at 2000 - 3000 f, and the brightness of the lights of the object relative to the brightness of passing aircraft lights) at within 7000 feet. My gut feeling while watching this thing was that it could not be man-made; I was also admiring the technology that could create something with this kind of performance envelope. Amazing! I continued to watch the sky for about a half an hour afterwards; I noted that the flight path of the object was directly over the approach path to YVR, and that at 21:55 an aircraft approached through the same airspace.

After a few seconds the object darted into the clouds and what seemed like into the atmosphere, then it faded away. We both decided to run to our other friends across the hallway to tell them. After explaing what we saw we all ran out to their balcony to see if it could be seen again. After a couple of minutes of staring into the sky we spotted it again but not as close as the initial sighting, now it appeared as an illuminating circular object. It seemed more energetic then before because its was speeding left to right zig-zagging in out of the clouds. Minutes later after settling down and deciding there is not much we could do but just observe it, I went back to my room and sat on the balcony viewing its maneuvering in the sky for a good hour. At one point I gestured to it so it would come closer and it stopped briefly and hovered in the sky for a good minute as if it had seen my gesture and was contemplating coming down to my level. It was quite the experience that I shall never forget. I still can&apos;t rationalize what it could have been, high tech Government project or a unexplainable natural phenomenon.((NUFORC Note:  Given the duration of the sighting, we suspect that the witnesses might have been observing a celestial body, possibly a planet.  PD))", "Triangular craft with an odd luminescence coming from the bottom of the craft.  It made no sound.This happened years ago but I didn&apos;t think much of it until I started noting that many of the reports are of these triangular aircraft. It all started after my two friends and myself were walking out of Dry Canyon right above Logan, Utah after hiking and having a simple cookout.  The night sky was clear and we could see miles in all directions as you can in the desert on clear nights such as this.  We were on the way home.  No car was necessary as Logan is within walking distance of the Wasatch National Forest.  I was talking to one of my friends when the other pointed over my shoulder and said, &quot;What is that?&quot;  His voice had a timber that leant to the urgency of his exclaimation.  I turned in the direction that he was pointing. SSW.  I saw a triangular craft moving slowly in our direction.  It fit the descriptions that I have been reading on this forum.  It was triangular with 4 lights.  Three small lights at the tips and one large light in the center that seemed to slightly illuminate the ground.  It flew directly over us at about 1000 ft and we were illuminated slightly as the large central light passed over us.  It made no sound.  There were two smaller craft at each wing tip that could not be discerned except by there dark outlines.  If you were to gauge their relative sizes, I would say they were approximatly the size of a minivan next to a bowing 747.  The three craft went over us and continued NNE until we lost them in the night sky.  The silence of the craft was earie.  After some reflection on what we had seen, we thought it was simply a new form of military aircraft practicing bombing runs over Logan as Hill AFB is located near Ogden, Utah.  I am also a skeptic considering I am a scientist and yet I have yet to see a craft such as this in any of the military arsenal since.  This makes the encounter all the more interesting.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There was no reply from the newspaper so she went and paid them a visit enquiring about the email she had sent to them. She eventually talked with the editor and the paper is going to run a short piece on what was witnessed that night in the April 8, 2004 in the Wednesday - April 28, 2004 newspaper. What the lady observed from her home was a bright pink spherical shaped object and surrounding the object was a dark blue aura. The object sat low, hovering over the Smithers Ski Hill Road until it just disappeared at a extreme rate of speed. Before the lady lost sight of it, it was moving very slowly from it&apos;s hovering position. She said there was not a sound coming from the object. The woman said she usually heads to bed earlier but she wasn&apos;t able to sleep and had been watching a program on TV when she decided to go outside to take her dog a pet cookie. She turned around to go back into her home and saw the strange object. She told me that it was not a plane as they are use to seeing them flying over top of the area all the time due to the Smithers airport being close by. A very important note is that the object was below the rim of the mountains. Also the object was &quot;not&quot; observed near any of the ski runs.

These lights were moving in an southeastly direction.  They appeared to be flying in some type of formation.  The light were very bright and flew at medium altitutde.  Once I thought that the lights were coming in the direction that I drove in.  At this time, I began to get scared and panicky.  I began to stop my car and the lights appeared at a stand-still in the sky.  At this time, I saw at least 4 to 5 lights and they appeared to have a battle.  I did not hear any sound.  These lights appeared to be shooting at each other.   After each light launch some type of explosive at the other, all the light simply disappeared before my eyes.  I have never seen them again.

They were lights appearing for minutes at a time, sometimes in couples, sometimes alone, then disappering. We saw as many as 6 lit at one time, and up to 14 total in diffent spots in the sky. They moved gradually, but never more than an inch from our perspective. The event is still ongoing, but we are no longer viewing them. The lights varied from low on the horizon to very high. They could not have been balloons, planes, gliders, fireworks, flares, meteors, or helicopters.", "Strange creatureIt was shaped somewhat like an arrowhead flying backwards, with what looked to be a head or knob on the front. It didn&apos;t look mechanical, more like some kind of animal. It did not have extended wings like a bird of any kind, but seemed to have some sort of stubby wings which were part of the body, like a flying squirl or some type of bat. They protruded out near the head, &amp; tapered back to a point at the rear. The creature appeared to be around 3 ft. from head to tail, &amp; a little over 2 ft. wide at the shoulders. It was moving very fast in a straight line at an altitude of approx. 150 ft. I saw no method of propulsion such as wing movement. It just seemed to be gliding, but at a high rate of speed. It maintained level flight moving west where I eventually lost sight of it. Other details were a light brown color along the sides of the wings, like skin, with a dark body color, possibly dark brown or black.", "Cigar shaped object is motionless for more than a minute, then moves west at incomprhensible speed, then out of sight.I was in the eighth grade and walking home from school to have lunch when almost directly in front of me and above (about where I&apos;d expect to see a plane flying) appeared a stationary oval or cigar shaped object, silver in color. I was looking south, and the Akron/Canton airport was behind me to the north. At first I thought it must be an aircraft flying directly at me and only appeared stationary, but the shape of the object was not correct for this. My guess was that it may have been a mile distant and approximately 30 degrees up. The weather was sunny and bright with white fluffy clouds, but the blue sky was exceptionally clear. Frustrated that I could not determine what it was, I remember running toward it to get closer, but the bouncing of my eyes interfered with my vision, so I stopped and watched while standing still so I might determine some movement. There was none, and then suddenly it moved to the west (my right) at an incredible speed, much too fast for anything I had ever seen. It went behind a cloud and never reappeared from the other side. Immediately following the incident, I continued home for lunch and told my mother what I had just seen. I knew she wouldn&apos;t think I was making it up, but I doubt she agreed with me that it was a UFO. Except for the speed, I&apos;m not sure I would have thought it was a UFO. For years I pretty much kept this information to myself, thinking a rational explanation would emerge, but I&apos;m 60 years old now, and the only things that sound similar to what I saw are the descriptions of UFO sightings by others. Now, 47 years later, I can say I have not seen anything since that even faintly made me think I was seeing a UFO, yet I can still remember clearly the details of what I saw that day. I cannot, however, say exactly what day that was since I never mentally recorded it, so the date is a guess based on my situation at the time.", "Hi  Myself and the kids spotted something which we can only describe as an UFO last night. What happened was this :  We live in Goedehoop, Strand, RSA  Last night at about 17h25 I quickly had to go to the local shop to get something for my girl which she needed for school the next day. My youngest daughter (11) also came along. While I was busy pulling my car out of the garage, they were waiting on the driveway. As I was pulling the car out they started yelling excitedly and I quickly stopped and got out to see what is the matter. My oldest daughter (12) pointed up to the heavens and said &quot;Look, that star,  it is moving.&quot;   We stood watching it closely and yes it was moving. I off course then explained that it must be a radio/telecommunications satellite, but as we were watching it, it changed direction randomly ( something a satellite does not do - Below is a sketch of the path it followed ) . It then started to accelerate in speed and changed colour ( blue, red, green.  I can&rsquo;t quite remember in which order - it all happened so fast ) and vanished into thin air. It originally came from Hangklip direction and vanished more or less above Helderberg. We must have been watching it for close on to a minute, maybe more ?

To the north we saw 3 white lights about the size of a pencil lead. They were stopping and going and changeing places with each other.  If you were to look straight up above your head and then tilt your head down about half way you could see them.  They danced around as if playing with each other.  They were spaced apart from 3 inches to several feet apart as they did this.  Then they divided and were spaced far from each other in sort of a triangle shape but way too far apart to be connected together as if they were lights on an airplane or something.  Then they all took off at the same time from a still position.  and shot straight up.  It was then that my sister and I saw a much larger object almost directly over head.  Also to the north of town.  This larger object was about the size of a half a ping pong ball.  and was stationary.  It also was white but also had a redish glow about it as well at times.The three small white lights then all flew toward the larger object and disapeared when they appeared to get about 3/4 of the way to the large object and then it all disappeared.  That summer we saw 3 or 4 unexplained objects in the night sky.  Sometimes 2 or 3 at a time. My mother was an advid star gazer and we knew what the sattalites at that time looked like and what stars looked like.  We often saw sputnick pass over head as we called it.  The objects we saw in late July were nothing like an airplane or a satalite of that time period.  The objects we saw that night were the most spectacular sightings we both ever had.  I listened to Coast to Coast on stream link today and heard that it doesnt matter when one saw what they saw they should still report it.  It is now, over 40 years later and when I close my eyes I can still picture this event as if it were yesterday.  And I still get that same creepy feeling of wonder and excitment as I did 40years ago.((name deleted)),  Shelby Ohio.

This morning, at about 3:35 AM, I had a pretty amazing sighting.  I went out in the back yard for a smoke and, as is my habit, I scanned the sky while puffing away.  I noticed a star moving, then another near it.  After checking to make sure it wasn&apos;t illusory movement, I noticed a third.  Basically, it was a triangular formation, two lights leading with the third trailing them.  The formation came in from the south-east.  As if that wasn&apos;t enough, as the trio passed directly overhead, a fourth &quot;appeared&quot;, joined the trio, and seemed to drop in altitude (perhaps because it definitely grew much larger and brighter than the other three).  The fourth came in from the east,  then changed course and speed to match the trio; the fourth partner sped off ahead of the trio to the north-east.  The trio followed slowly, taking about 3 minutes to cross the sky and disappear. (By the way, I say &quot;trio&quot; rather than &quot;HUGE black triangle&quot; because the stars only semed to dim and blur as the triangular formation crossed them, rather than completely blocking stars as I expect an intervening triangular vehicle would.)  Anyway, I was amazed and felt fortunate.  Nope, I wasn&apos;t inebriated/chemically-modified in any way (besides the nicotine).

A triangle shaped craft was spotted by the three of us flying directly over our heads, approximately 100 feet above the palm trees by my driveway.  It appeared to be black, but very visible to the naked eye.  We saw what looked like 7 small circles on the bottom of this craft, one at the point, and three on each side.  This craft was so low, that we could make out the outer rings around these disks, which were concave in shape.  It flew directly over the top of us, not very fast, but not slow either.  It continued on for about 500 feet, ascended, and disappeared right in front of our eyes.  The thing that really struck us was three things....first of all, there were no lights of ANY kind on this craft, but we  could see it clearly, as if the city lights reflected off the bottom, kind of luminescent.  The second is that for it flying so low, there was not a single air current in its wake in the tops of the palm trees, like a copter or plane would generate.  Lastly, but most importantly, it made ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND!  No engine noise, no wind, nothing.  What is really strange is that we live literally in the Marine Corp Air Staion&apos;s back yard...something flying as low as this craft was would never be seen on their radar. We see military and civilian crafts all day and night, because we also live right next to the airport.  This was like nothing we have ever seen before.", "Very large, boomerang shaped object, silently moving slowly at treetop height East to West with no wind disturbance.I indicated that the craft sighted was &quot;triangle&quot; but it was really more of a boomerang shape. This thing was very large, at least a city block long from tip to tip and had dim white lights all around the edges. The color was gray/black and it blocked out the stars above as it passed over us at approximately tree top level and very slowly. There was no sound, nor was there any wind disturbance of any kind.  We kept asking each other &quot;do you see that???&quot; and I even pinched myself to make the point of conciousness on my part clear to myself. We did not notice it until it was almost directly above us as we sat in my &apos;63 chev convertable with the top down (facing north) and we watched as it slowly made its way west and disappeared into the distance. The strangest part I thought was the fact that none of us were frightened by this unusual event. This was in a place that we called &quot;space country&quot; because there was not much of anything but space out there in the early 70&apos;s. Dirt roads and wheat and corn fields with nobody out there but us usually. We would go out late at night and hotrod our cars along the dirt roads. The area is what is now Aurora, CO. Back then it was approximately 15 minutes east of the old Stapleton International Airport via I-70. Later, a few weeks? we were out there again and it was day time and we noticed a few radar domes nearby where the sighting took place and speculated that the craft was spying on the installation which we found out was Buckley Air National Guard Base rumoured to be a testing ground for experimental aircraft. The craft we saw as related here, in my opinion, was not made by humans. It far surpassed any of the stealth type aircraft that I have seen currently deployed by our USAF.

Driving home from work on the Trans Canada Highway on the western edge of Calgary proceeding west- I observed a commercial aircraft overflying Calgary at cruise altitudes proceeding west ahead of me.  The sun had just set below the horizon, however the sun was reflecting off the commercial aircraft and the vapor trail behind it.  The sky was bright blue, clear and this sight was very pretty.  At this point I noticed a reflection off an object slightly to the right and to the rear of the commercial aircraft. The reflection was also moving and was matching the speed of the commercial aircraft.  From my position driving my truck down the highway-the commercial aircraft and object were approx 45-50 degrees above the horizon and my estimations were that the object was at the same altitude as the commercial aircraft, approx 1000- 2000 ft behind it( less than a mile) The 2nd objects speed and distance remained constant for the duration. There was no vapor trail behind the 2nd object, and the commercial aircraft did emmit a vapor trial 3-5 miles long.  As they proceeded westbound the reflections changed slightly  - and I was left with the impression the object was much smaller than the commercial aircraft and was spherical in shape.   Eventually as they proceeded westbound they dropped below my feild of view ( Large hill just west of Calgary ) I have a 25 year background in aviation including over 5000 hrs of flying and found it very odd to have two aircraft flying formation and to have only one emitting a vapor trail at such altitudes. My hobbies include astronomy and following the USA Space Programs and I am familiar with Planets-satilites- the Space Station -Shuttle re-entry  and most things which we see in the sky.

I KNOW what I saw was real and in all my reading, research, etc., can&apos;t justify it away with any other answer! At the time, the area we lived in was very rural.  We live about 30 miles south of Phoenix, and in an area with very few homes (3).  We live 15 miles SW of the town of Maricopa.  I was in my house watching TV when my brother in law came screaming up to the door.  When I answered, he just said, &quot;Look!&quot; and pointed to the Eastern sky.What we saw at first was what I said looked like planes flying in a V-formation.  He kept arguing.  As we watched, the craft moved in our direction VERY SLOWLY.  Eventually, it came directly over our house.  This thing was HUGE!!!!!!! It was solid black.  It was probably no more than 100 feet above our house.  We live on 3 1/3 acres and the wing span easily reached side to side.  It was moving incredibly slow.  I have been around planes a lot in my life.  This was not a plane.  You could see NO landing gear doors, no rivits on the bottom of the craft, no call numbers, no lights on the wings.  It was very much a boomerang shape with a small tail added to that shape.  I have drawn the shape a 1,000 times since then.As it approached us, there was a single center light inside, more like the irridescent glow of a light...greenish.  I saw no movement inside, just light.The craft continued to move east to west at the same slow rate...we were able to walk at a very normal pace to stay under it.  I walked to our fence line, about 180 feet away, under it and stood there and watched it.  It continued across the desert about a mile past my inlaws acerage, then stopped and turned very, very slowly to the south where it just seemed to sit for a few seconds.  Then it flipped upward, sort of tilted onto its back and was GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can&apos;t even come close to the speed it left.There was absolutely NO SOUND coming from this craft.  I think I have never been outside at night since, that I have not watched the sky, looking for its return.About a week later, there was a report in a small mountain town to the northeast of us, Morenci, that the same shaped HUGE object was observed during a football game.  I tried to write the paper in Morenci, but never received a response.This was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  I had 2 cameras hanging just inside the door, but was afraid to open the door and go in for fear I would miss something.  I was just AMAZED.  I have kicked myself OFTEN for that choice.

I suspect that it was 2-5 miles in altitude. Any farther would have made it unbelievably hugh.

There was another smaller craft tailing the larger, and it followed at a constant distance of an estimated 500&apos;. It was dificult to see details of the smaller because of the white and gray smokey trail it left behind. It appeared to be bullet shaped with a shiny, metalic nose and a reflective glassy material (cockpit?) behind that. The rest of the second object was obscured by the smoke.

I let them off their leashes and let them run.  I stood under a group of eucalyptus trees and looked northeasy admiring the sky.  In the distance there are mountains (not high).  Between the mountains came what looked like the lights of an airplane in the distance.  I was just idly watching waiting for the dogs to be finished so I could go back to the house, as there are normally many planes on this part of the sky.  However, the plane lights seemed to be heading right where I was standing and considerably lower than normal.  I was hypnotized by the brightness and then realized that it might be going to crash.  I called the dogs to me and they came running and I felt I would not be able to escape the crash.  The dogs were frightened.  Suddenly, a large cloud, swirling and brilliant appeared.  The sky had been clear as a bell.  I awaited by seconds the crash and the plane to come through the cloud.  In another second it was again clear as a bell and no plane , no lights nothing.  It was very dark and soundless.  I gathered the very excited, scared dogs and went back to my house and told my husband and l3 year old daughter what had happened.  He just went to bed but my daughter came out and we crossed the road again and looked to see if we could see anything but it was too dark.

The sound began with a series of soft booms like distant fireworks in rapid succession, lasting about 5 seconds.  It then gradually smoothed to a low rumble, and maintained the same volume for perhaps another 5 seconds.  During the next and final 5 seconds it very gradually faded away, so gradually that I was not sure when it was completely gone.  I am familiar with the tendency for people to overestimate the duration of events, so this morning I ran several timed tests with a stopwatch, reciting to myself the changing nature of the sound, and only looking at the watch after.  I consistently measured within 2 seconds +- of 15 seconds, trying 4 times. The sound occurred at 2:44 am according to my nightstand digitial clock, which I subsequently found to be about 15 seconds fast relative to WWV.  I do not know the time more precisely - there is no seconds indication on the clock. The sound was not loud: it did not awaken my wife sleeping next to me, and I only heard it because I happened to be awake.  At first I thought it was the precursor rumbling to an earthquake, having experienced the 2001 magnitude 6.8 Nisqually quake.  When I realized that it was not being followed by shaking, I thought it must be a heavy jet transport leaving Sea-Tac airport.  We can occasionally hear those, although they typically do not depart at 3 in the morning.  Then I recall noting that the sound had a real &quot;feel&quot; to it, even though it was muted, and I could sense the pressure waves, not just hear the sound. I went back to sleep thinking it might have been a distant earthquake.  The next morning, the 6 am local news mentioned that a number of people had reported lights and fireballs in the sky &quot;a few minutes&quot; before 3 am.

We witnessed this for approximately 2 minutes while driving this short stretch of McDowell Mountain Ranch Road and dismissed it as possibly some type of city lights in the distance.  When we turned, we could no longer see the lights due to buildings and trees obscuring the path. On Tuesday, June 15th when driving the same stretch of McDowell Mountain Ranch Road at approximately the same time, we realized that the &quot;city lights&quot; we thought we had seen were not there. Later that evening, I went out alone to run an errand and get gas.  At 10:45 p.m., (this time I noted the time)I was travelling west on Bell Road and at the corner of Bell Road and Thompson Peak Parkway, I noticed a set of two lights in the sky, almost identical (in shape and color) to the lights I saw the night before.  I also observed some planes in the sky and determined these lights were much larger in size and different in color from the plane lights.  I called my husband who was at home (1 mile from my location) and he saw the same lights from an upstairs window.  My vision became obscured by trees and apartments (I was driving) while he continued to watch.  He said he could see 4 lights and then they blinked off and there were only 2 lights.  When they came back into my view, we both observed they appeared to be slightly changing colors from orange to orangish red.  I continued to drive and lost sight again due to driving into a lower elevation.  My husband observed them blink off and then he could no longer see them. I pulled into the local gas station at the corner of McDowell Mountain Ranch Road and Thompson Peak Parkway asked an employee if anyone had mentioned these lights and she said she spoke to a man the previous evening who reported seeing them at approximately the same time (8:45p.m.) that we had seen them.  However, he said he saw two lights separate and multiply to four lights and then separate and multiply to eight lights and then remain stationary in the sky for several minutes before taking off.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found her to be exceptionally lucid, objective, and credible.

As it came closer, I realized it couldn&apos;t be a bird because it was too big.  It was shiny silver and flew slowly towards me.  Then 2 or more (can&apos;t remember) Army helicopters (had camophlage paint on them)came behind it.  The craft suddenly dived into some trees and the helicopters followed it.

My husband said &quot;Must be a helicopter.&quot; I opened the car window to listen for the sounds of a helicopter and there were none.  Then he said &quot;Maybe it is a UFO&quot;,and he was serious. We kept watching and it still did not move. After about 5 minutes it began to move until it seemed to be right above our vehicle.  It was very high up and it was very large. The very bright lights,3 large ones(white,yellowish,red...I&apos;m not sure if there were other colours)were rotating back and forth so that when it was above our car, I was looking straight up out of the front window of the car and I could see that the bottom of this flying object was completely filled in. Not long like an airplane.  At first I thought it was roundish because I think that is what I expected to see but as the lights reflected underneath it looked more triangular.  I was so excited and things happened so quickly that I didn&apos;t pay as much attention to detail as I wished I had.  We stopped the car on the side of the road to take a better look and it then flew away into the direction of Mt Benson.  The last I saw of it, it was either hovering over the valley just below Mt.

We were just sitting back relaxing and I saw a dark dot south of us moving northeast.  As I watched it I  was trying to figure out what it was. As it got closer I was looking for  wings and thats when  I SAID TO MY friend I see no definition to it. By then it was getting closer. We could see something dark that looked like a squsished donut. It was oblong but not too long.  Then the horses, dogs, two loose goats, started acting up, the wind started blowing, a cottonwood branch fell and and all three of us felt strange after that.  The wind was blowing just a little north of west, at about 20 to 30 mph. It lasted 10 or 15 minutes.  We observed the object for 2 to 3 minutes but the time is hard for me to calculate, it could have been 5 min. We ran around a tree to look at it, because the tree leaves were starting to block our view.  Then we couldn&apos;t see it so we ran around the corral which took 6-9 sec.  Then there was nothing. no sign of it.  I stood there with 2 other people looking, wondering where it went.

I did however find a photo of a similiar object on their web site.  I tried to find it today, but was not able to do so.

If I moved the radar beam up or down 10 degrees or so the return would decrease to zero. When I would tune back to center it was back. But only sky could be seen outside.

Around 4 AM my husband and I were awakened because a very intense pure white intense wide band similar to a flood light entered our bedroom from a window that faced northeast (through drape and shade).

The bedroom section is in an area secluded and surrounded by vines, trees and an art studio separates it&apos;s view from any street or road activity.  Completely.  No way can lights reach our house from the street (which is a dead end)  without passing through the other structure.  We are not level with the street. The lights came through the window slowly. Very very slowly.  It took its time to enter. It did not explode into our environment. They appeared in one wide band of illumination and spread over the entire west side of the room.  It did not touch the bed area...only the wall opposite us. It raked across the entire area.  Touching every inch of the wall space the closets and furniture. It was like a huge flood light. It illuminated the entire room.  It also confused us and when it ended my husband went to sleep again without any thought as to the happening.  I though went to the window to see if there was anyway possible for it to have happened. I then  also explored the entire house and investigated if there was any odd situation that dould have contributed to this.  I looked out all windows. Nothing was out of place.  I am not sure of the date.  It happened twice.  For cetain the date was exactly between January 6, 2001 and January 26, 2001.  It hapened twice in around mid month.  The first time was the most intense.  The seccond time was of less duration and not as overwhelming a manifestation.  My first th! ought had been that it could be the work of was that a nut neighbor. I thought maybe someone had climbed onto our property with a huge floodlight.  if indeed someone could scale an 8 foot fence carrying such an object.  My husband disputed the thought and said it was not possible.  Besides our dogs never barked.

Not until last night or early this morning (June 4/5, 2004)  during the Coast to Coast broadcast about UFOs did anything connected with the possibility of it having a connection with UFOs enter my thinking.  Although my husband and I did have a few UFO experiences scattered throughout our lives... they had nothing to do with this type of flood lighting.I figure it was around 4 AM as we had gone to bed after 1 AM and got up at 7 AM.
