What was odd, was that it seemed to be a long enough object that it had quite a space between it&apos;s lights. A very bright hot pink burning light at the front of it, and a bright turquoise blue light burning at the back of it with a decent sized space in between the lights which gave it the appearance of being a long object.  I thought for sure it was a plane going down, but there was no smoke and no trail like a meteor.  It was low on the horizon and didn&apos;t travel a great distance, but I had no idea how far away it was.  It seemed large in proportion to the normal air traffic I see in my horizon.  I yelled to my guest...&quot;____, Come here quick!&quot; and it was still visible while I said that after I spotted it, so I know it had to be visible for at least 6-8 seconds before it just disappeared.  I&apos;ve seen lots of meteors in the daylight, and the colors of this object and the distance between the bright colors made me think for sure it was an aircraft going down. However, it just disappeared with no smoke and no sound.  About a half an hour later, a large helicopter hovered in the sky for over 30 minutes in the general direction I had seen the object, and then the helicopter just took off to the West, almost over me.  By then it was dark.  There was no sound that I heard from the object, and it did not leave a trail at all even as it flew through the sky and appeared to be going down right before it disappeared in a clear sky.", "small object from SW to N. 30-35 degress above the horizon - dispersed into 9 -12 egg-shaped low luminous objects (&lt;2seconds)At approximately 10:45pm on April 12/07, I was outside on my patio deck, which faces towards the East.  It was an exceptionally clear night sky and I was impressed by the clarity of most of the brightest stars in the Eastern sky, including Regulus, which is the first star I was able to identify.  I was about to come inside after a couple of minutes of stargazing, when I noticed a very subdued and somewhat translucent object appear in the Southern Sky above the angle of my garage roof that caught my attention for just a second or two, due to its very fast South to North motion in the sky.  It appeared as a single object and then rapidly dispersed into several, 9 to 12 egg-shaped, very uniform objects that scattered in shotgun like pattern and then completely disappeared.  I would estimate the angle above the horizon and my garage roof to be about 30-35 degrees; was unusually horizontal and low to the horizon for a meteoric atmospheric contact.  I have witnessed hundreds of meteor showers over the years and have seen countless satellites in the night sky.  Most of these types of observations have had a distinctive brilliance or very noticeable luminosity to them.  In this particular case, which only lasted a couple of seconds, had a relativity low luminosity and certain amount of translucent quality to it.I suppose this event could most likely be classified as a low angle, low mass, meteoric atmospheric contact, which didn&rsquo;t have a lot of rarefaction to it and thus very low luminosity or brilliance as most of the meteoric displays that I have witnessed in the past, however, this even I would consider to be of importance due to the uniformity of the object and dispersion pattern and its low level luminosity and translucence that I have never before seen in the sky.  After this occurred, I came inside to note the time on the clock on the stove, which was 10:47pm.  I went outside again, to see if there were any more meteoric activity, when I noticed a cloud formation in the Eastern sky , above the city, which wasn&rsquo;t there previously.  This cloud formation was very small and somewhat rectangular and eventually disappeared in a matter of minutes.", "At 2150 hrs, I walked outside of my house and looked to the south towards Ontario International Airport and witnessed a very bright orange light moving slowly to the North East. This caught my eye because it looked exactly like the light I witnessed and reported last month in the same area but much slower. I called to my wife to come outside so she could witness it. It was moving very slow with several large passenger jets passing over it.  I asked my wife to retrieve my binoculars from the house, as she was inside it stopped and hovered without moving.  As looked through the binoculars, I witnessed a slight aura around the object, neither blinking strobes nor lights. It was a very bright orange, unknown structure, and had no apparent noise coming from it.  We stood and observed it for about 3-4 minutes. The orange light blinked off and on several times and then it disappeared from its stationary position. My wife was freaked out by the whole experience.  I know many people witnessed this for the weather was very clear and the light was very bright. I am curious if Ontario International Airport was aware of this?", "Two Bright Lights observed - faded away simultaneouslyTwo lights as bright as the North Star was lined up vertically, they appeared in the North Eastern sky for about a minute and a half.

Facing South, I saw at about 45 degrees azimuth an array of 4-5 dim orange or amber, round lights in an obtuse &quot;V&quot; pattern, almost a straight line.   The lights were smaller in diameter than a pencil eraser and moving north at extremely high speed.  They were silent.  I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend what it was, and I turned to watch as they passed over.  As I tried to identify the shape, the left-most light deviated from the formation by increasing its distance from the next closest light, while the others maintained the same formation.   The formation traversed approximately 120 degrees of the visible sky between apartment buildings in 3 or 4 seconds.  I could not tell their altitude.At the same time, a commercial airliner was crossing the sky at nearly the same vector, but a much higher altitude.

For the record, she has never been diagnosed with any sort of mental illness, and is not a drinker.  She is well respected to this day in the community, and has numerous friends who would testify to her honesty and sobriety.  In October of &apos;57 or &apos;58, my older sister, who would have been about 11 or 12 at the time, woke up in the middle of the night sick, and called for mother.  My mother heard her, and when she got up out of bed, she saw from the window a glowing orange disk or saucer shaped object hovering over our yard, very close to the house.  We live in the country, and the night was clear, cool, with a light breeze.  As she approached the window to get a better look, she noticed what she has called indentations on the edge of the object.  To describe what happened next would be the really unusual aspect of this report.  She got the very distinct mental impression that they (her words) meant her no harm, and was told not to fear this event.  After watching the object for an undetermined amount of time, it went straight up at an extremely high rate of speed until it was no longer visible.  There were no sounds heard.  I have often wondered what may have happened to her during the time my sister called from her room, because she has said it took mother forever to come to her.  She actually didn&apos;t tell us about this until a few weeks later, but there is no denying the fact she believes what she saw.

Knowing it was dark out I stepped out on the starboard side deck just to see what I could (often seeing lights of other ships in the distance in these conditions.)  I presume the sky was hazy or partly cloudy as I could see only a few brighter stars.  The moon was not visible from my vantage point (I do not know its phase or position on the date.)  The horizon was very faintly visible as a just marginally brighter line above the sea.  There were no visible lights on the horizon. I don&rsquo;t know the heading of the ship but according to the passenger update log it would probably be somewhere between 110 Degrees and 70 Degrees.  The ship had sailed toward the southeast and then turned towards the north.  The sighting occurred at about the point where the turn was (to be) made.  No land lights were visible. Three stars/lights did slightly stand out as they formed a triangle with two of the lights in a roughly horizontal line with the third lower and to the right.  The separation of the top two lights was roughly 1 degree.  The third light was roughly 2 degrees to the lower right.  I am estimating these distances by mental reference to the size of a full moon &ndash; one half subtended degree.  The center of this triangle was about 10-15 degrees above the horizon and about 45 degrees to the rear of the direction of travel of the ship. As I looked at these three lights for about 10 seconds, I perceived that the upper left and lower right lights were faintly orange in color while the upper right one was white.  The white one was a clear point, as would be expected when viewing a star, and as other stars visible at the time appeared.  The two orange lights appeared slightly fuzzy.  Focusing my attention to these orange lights I noticed that they actually appeared brighter in the center with areas to the sides that appeared to &ldquo;flutter&rdquo; and very rapidly change intensity from dim to almost as bright as the center.  This total width of light was no more than one quarter degree.  This same &ldquo;fluttering&rdquo; effect was not visible above or below the center of the light. My first notion was that they appeared to be helicopters, in that you can see a center mass and perceive the rotor as a &ldquo;fluttering&rdquo; change in intensity to the sides.  This is a description of the appearance only; there was no sound and there were no navigation or marker lights, and helicopters probably wouldn&rsquo;t be glowing orange. After seeing the three lights in position for no more than 10 seconds total, the two orange lights began moving to the left, relative to the white point star which did not move.  The few other white point stars visible did not move either (the ship was not turning.)  Over a total period of around 30 seconds that these orange lights moved, the top one moved roughly horizontally to a position roughly 45 degrees to the front of the ship.  During that movement it did dip slightly in apparent altitude when it was about 90 degrees off the side of the ship.  The other light also moved at the same time as the first but its movement was independent of the first.  It first moved slightly down and to the left, then rose slightly and then continued horizontally to the left.  When it was almost 90 degrees to the side of the ship it dipped slightly and then rose to the same height as the first light.  It &ldquo;followed&rdquo; the first light for a second of two and then dropped slightly, all the while moving to the left. When these lights both reached the position approximately 45 degrees to the front of the ship they both faded out and I lost further sight of them. To reiterate, I could not tell the exact atmospheric conditions during this sighting but there were maybe 25 visible stars in my field of vision.  These were white sharp points of light that did not move relative to the ship or to each other during the time I saw the orange lights, which did move both relative to the visible stars and to each other.  Although they did move together and at the same time, the movement of the orange lights varied in speed and in altitude relative to each other, the other visible stars and to the horizon. They were stationary for about 10 seconds and moved for about 30 seconds before disappearing.  The lower of the two lights moved a greater distance than the top one and therefore moved faster as they both started moving at the same time and disappeared from view at the same time with about the same distance separation.

We were on the road from El Paso, and we were just outside of Valentine, TX when this happened.  He was at the wheel and I noticed a jet flying in the distance above, moving left to right as we looked through the front windshield.  The jet was black.  It was close enough to see that it was a jet, but not so close that we could see any logos or other colors that may have been on it.A beam of darkness shone out from the front end of the jet.  The beam was perfectly straight; it looked like it was coming out of the very tip of the nose of the jet.  It was just like a beam from a flashlight except that it was a beam of darkness.  My boyfriend saw it too and we talked about it for several minutes while it was in view.

Then suddenly my co-worker started looking hard at something in the night sky that caught his eye.  I recognized him looking up at something so I turned around and looked up myself.  We both saw a super bright light above us less than 100 stories high almost skidding to a halt or vibrating back and forth momentarily.  Then as we both looked up very hard together, it took off streaking across the night sky visibly noticeable.From my evaluation this was probably a invisible space craft that wanted to exposed a super bight light to the both of us letting us know that they were above us.  The size of this super bright light was like the size of a basketball.  When I looked up it must of been hovering above us for who knows how long.

It was a cool, clear, pleasant evening so I stood outside in the back yard for a minute or two enjoying the breeze and looking at the stars. It was very dark outside, except for the normal lights associated with houses and streetlights. Living right next to an air force base, I also have the occasion to see and hear many planes everyday, and for a while that is exactly what I thought this object was. As I am standing there, I see what appears to be a white and bluish-to bluish-green light each one flashing alternately very close together way  in the distance up in the sky. At this point I could not see anything structural, it was at a very far distance at this point.  I do not know if this was the top, bottom, or side of the object which had the flashing lights. My first impression was that they were the lights you would normally associate with airplanes sometimes as they come in for a landing. Something about them seemed unusual to me; the weird blue color wasn&rsquo;t what I was used to seeing, and the speed of the strobe was way off. The flashing lights were much faster and also much brighter than I have ever seen on any airplane. I stood there watching it out of curiosity at that point, thinking that naturally if it is a plane, it&rsquo;s heading for the Air Force base, and that meant it would have to generally head in a direction and path that was familiar to me from watching airplanes take off and land in the same place for years.  I thought this might afford me a better look at what kind of airplane it was. As it kept getting closer, I thought for sure that it was going to head toward the base, but instead of turning toward the base, it was proceeding directly toward my general location. When it got within my field of vision and I could make it out clearly,  I could only see the bottom of the object, and the outline of the overall shape, which was triangular, and the color of the triangle was a non-reflective black. It was so black that I could make it out against the contrast of the night sky. The white and bluish lights were not flashing or blinking at this time that I could see, but there were lights on the bottom of the object. A small, round, white light was in each corner of the triangular shaped object, with a larger red light in the center of it, which may have been concave. The white lights on the tips of the triangle remained constant, they did not flash or dim , however the red light in the middle seemed to glow or pulse very slowly. At this point I still did not completely understand what I was looking at, because it was flying very low, lower than airplanes are allowed to fly, I know that.  And it was moving very slowly in a perfectly horizontal fashion. The smooth slow glide of the object put me in the mind of the idea of pushing something heavy on the ice and watching it slowly glide across in a level straight line.  That it what this object appeared to do .  It passed overhead maybe one or two houses east of my location, but nearly directly overhead. It had to be less than 300&rsquo; ft in the air, it was so close I felt like I could have hit it with a rock, had I thrown one at it. As it glided over the houses, I opened the gate and quickly walked to the front yard to continue observing the object. It just continued in a level, straight line in a southeasterly direction, and I observed it until it was out of sight, about 30 seconds to a minute I would say total observation from the time I could first visually make it out until the time that it was out of  my field of vision. I kept thinking that something wasn&rsquo;t right, and it wasn&rsquo;t until it was almost out of sight that I realized that not only had it passed lower and slower than any airplane I had ever seen, but it also never made any noise at all. None. Not a single rumble, vibration or hum. Completely silent.  When it was out of sight, I went back into the house. I thought I might hear something about other people sighting the same thing, but nothing was ever mentioned by anyone or any news organization as far as I know.

It was positioned above a contrail.  I watched it for about 5 minutes and could see it was definitely NOT an airplane, helicoptor, hot air balloon, parachutist or other typical aircraft.  I could see it was colored orange and white, was rectangular and was in an upright position, with the narrow sides of the rectangle being the top and bottom of the thing. I could also see it slowly rotating to my right.  After that I ran inside to get my binoculars and was frantically calling my other two sons to come outside and see this thing with me. We went to the front yard and observed it for quite some time- maybe 15 minutes, both with the naked eye and the binoculars.  The object had begun to move slowly to the west.  I told my 12 year-old son to go get his telescope.   He brought it out quickly and I fiddled with trying to get the thing to focus on the object but it had gotten so high in the sky while traveling westward it was impossible to get the telescope balanced that high although I did get it in view several times only it lose it.  However while I was busy focusing I did see what I thought were white things shooting out of it or something shooting out that disturbed the atmosphere.  I passed it off as my eyes were playing tricks on me while I was trying to focus.  I had seen 4 or 5 of the things shoot out - toward the south.  It looked like white things of various sizes followed by streaks of heatwaves or that clear mirage type of thing.  Then my 12 year-old son said:  &quot;Mom, I see things shooting out of it!&quot;   I asked him to tell me what they looked like, he said they were white things.  I asked him what direction he saw them go and he said to his right which was the south. I then knew I had indeed seen things shooting out of it. I gave up on the telescope and used the binoculars while the object then moved south.  We watched this thing for a relatively long time, about 45 mintues total.  Then it just disappeared, vanished.

An orange afterglow still was visable and it went skyward very fast through the cloud layer. this whole even took about 10 min. I waited and went in and out for about 15 min, and started looking over my house by the way to make sure it wasnt over me. After about 15 min the object again came back to the origanal location.  Wanting to get a better view i got my binoculars a pair of stiner comanders, they are old but work well.  what i saw was an object inside the light that appeared to look like the capital letter D. I watched it for about 15 more min as it changed color from bright orange to white.  It looked very much like a star but with the binoculars you could see an object insid! e the light quite well. I viewed the object till about 10:15pm and attempted to call my wife at her grandmothers house at the time, the phone didnt work at this time but gave me the option of leaving her a message. I since talked to her this morning and that message never made it to her.  I dont know if that is related or not.  I do know the object did take notice of me flashing it with my divelight and turned its lights down and took off. I also belive the object was small as it didnt seem very far away less than a mile, but cant be sure.  I do know it was much closer than an average helecoptor flying over the area and belive it was over the houseing track behind mine. As for the size and this is only a guess I would say the size of maybe a city trash can.

I&rsquo;d often go out there at all hours of the day, so 11p.m. wasn&rsquo;t unusual. At one moment I happened to be glancing at the sky, when I noticed what appeared to be a vertical line formation of about six (if I remember correctly) stars all moving at the same time.  It actually took a couple of seconds for it to sink in.  I mean if I understand correctly, this isn&rsquo;t exactly normal star behavior.  Six stars in a vertical line, moving all at the same speed. I watched them for several seconds and then all at the same time they just stopped.  They stayed that way for several more seconds before the top one shot off in a northeast direction.  Then after a few more seconds all of the rest of the &quot;stars&quot; scattered in different directions and disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At first glance, I saw a blinking light in non-stop motion.  I thought of it being a low-altitude plane, yet the light was too small (giving the appearance of a high-altitude one), plus at the given time, it was twilight, and I could not see the silhouette of the aircraft, which you would be able to normally.  After witnessing the flash, I thought of the object being a meteorite.  I looked back in curiosity, and I saw another quick streak of light shoot off in a different direction, near the point where the first light disappeared.  I aroused suspicion, and watched the sky longer.  The streak moved again, this time, heading westward, the opposite direction from which the first shot of light advanced.  And about a second later, another flash ensued, going in the direction making a complete box if the light were to move continuously, without an intermission. Possibilities I assumed to which the lights could be were:  A helicopter Fireworks Or meteorites falling coincidentally to form four 90 degree angles.

At first, I assumed it was a firefly since I live in the woods, but this light did NOT blink.  I also thought it was an airplane because they are constantly traveling back and forth from Atlanta but there were no red, blue, or blinking lights. Next, I thought it could be a shooting star but it had no tail of debree and remained in my view for an extended period.  As the object moved in a straight line to the north, it changed direction, which seemed to defy the laws of physics, and headed west.  This is when I knew it was not a shooting star because this object also zigzagged a couple of seconds after changing direction in a &quot;S&quot; type curve.  The change of direction and zigzag motion seemed to last approximately 5 seconds. This object had to be moving at least twice as fast as a commercial airplane.

The location was Makokibatan Lodge, an outpost on Makokibatan Lake which is only accessible by float plane. We had our own &quot;cabin attendant,&quot; a very sweet and down-to-earth woman in her 50s, who would knock on our door early every morning with coffee, and remind us that the fish are not going to catch themselves.  We got to know her well by the end of the trip.One night, my brother and I went outside, and stepped into a wooded area just out of range of the dock light&rsquo;s glow, and looked up to enjoy the sky. I&rsquo;ve seen many star-dense skies in zero light pollution areas, but this one, presumably because of our boreal latitude, was breathtaking. The thing that immediately struck us both though, was all the STUFF flying around up there!  I&rsquo;m versed in the subject of aerospace, and my brother is a high-level electrical engineer that maintains a military security clearance for the work he does with the Department of Naval Intelligence, for which he has worked on satellite projects. We recognized this satellite/space junk mess above our heads for what it was, but it was quite a sight. I&apos;ve never seen so many star-like objects in transit across the sky in my life. The night sky in this place is alive.  At times we would see as many as 4 different satellites in various orbits at once.  My brother pointed out a couple that were in polar orbits, which he said were either military or WX.  We saw a very tight constellation of three evenly spaced satellites forming a triangle traversing the sky in formation, and a blinking star-like object, which my bro informed me was a spin-stabilized satellite of some kind.  I&rsquo;d be lying though if I said I wasn&rsquo;t watching all of them very closely for a change in vector or speed, but of course they were what they were.  Quite a show.The next morning, our cabin lady came in, and in small talk, we told her what a great sky we enjoyed last night and how we couldn&rsquo;t believe how much garbage was flying around up there, and she related that the sky is one of the reasons she feels lucky to live up there etc. With last night&rsquo;s light show still fresh in our minds, to my surprise especially coming from my brother, he followed up with, &quot;So, have you ever seen anything strange?&quot; She replied in her thick Canadian accent, &quot;Oh yeah, well, me, once.&quot;  Her response was patently nonchalant and innocent.  Surprised, we pressed her for more.  She went on to describe a night a few years previous, off-season, where she was up by the cabins while 3 or 4 &quot;hands&quot; were working at the dock, and they observed a &quot;large&quot; orange sphere, self luminous and about the brightness and color of &quot;one of those orange street lamps,&quot; casting shadow as it approached over the treetops on the opposite side of the lake, hover over the center of the lake at 300-400ft AGL (my estimation based on where she pointed), then descend to touch the surface of the lake. She said it &quot;dipped&quot; slightly into the lake and just sat there. (Note: It&apos;s a very large, choppy lake, so no &quot;ripples&quot; would be visibly cast and were not mentioned, nor did she mention any bobbing in the chop). It stayed there for a number of seconds, then ascended slowly, accelerated, and &quot;shot straight up&quot; and out of sight. She spoke in a quiet tone and gave me the impression as if she was almost a little embarrassed to share the story, but again, casual about it. She ended the account by saying dismissively, &quot;I don&rsquo;t know what it was.&quot; and dispensed a shrug. She did imply during this conversation that many of the employees have their own experiences. As she spoke, i got the impression that her attitude was that in this place with such a conspicuous, immersive, impossible-to-ignore sky that occasionally seeing something &quot;strange&quot; is just kinda bound to happen eventually if you work and live here. In retrospect I wished I had pressed her for a little more detail, but didn&rsquo;t think it was appropriate at the time. The previous night, while gazing at that crystal clear, star-blanketed dome that betrayed to us every single little chunk of trash parading above us, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think, &quot;Well, if UFOs are real and one got anywhere near this place, you sure as hell wouldn&rsquo;t miss it.&quot;  I think the unassuming, down to earth folks that work in this place are probably quite aware of that too.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

What could that be?&rdquo;  I saw white lines cutting through the atmosphere in a parabolic shape.  The trail only lasted a few seconds before it completely vanished from the top down.   The trail was about two-thirds longer than the bottom portion and was most interesting to watch as it faded into nothing.

The same day but much earlier 8-9PM, Myself and 3 other friends were walking along the New Waterford cliffslide next to the ocean and to our discovery we spotted a weird bright star in the sky casting a glow over the ocean.  We thought this was pretty weird considerin the glow. As we watched it, It became bigger and brighter.  At first we all thought it was a meteor and beganning running, But we eventually stopped and watched the light come closer,  As it neared closer, We seen it was a craft of some sort but we all found it very odd that it was not giving off any sounds, Finally it flew overhead in a rather sluggish motion and we all got a pretty good look at what we were seeing. Around it was a faint triangle silohuette, At each corner a orangish light, In the middle a bigger white-blue spotlight and then much smaller pastel-like lights around its rim. After it hovered over us, It headed off towards New Waterford&apos;s town and then suddenly qucikened it&apos;s pace and disapeared over some houses. This is not a hoax nor joke of any kind, There was besides myself, 3 other witnesses present at the time of the sighting.Sinse the event, I tryed to make my sighting go public or get an ufologist&apos;s input on what I&apos;ve seen, But unfortinately could not contact any reliable sources. I am 100% convinced that this could be the same sighting reported in here from New Vic  Thank you", "10/15/89 Bright fast moving light over valley west of Glennallen, AlaskaExtreme bright light moving East to South West across a wide valley.  This was AFTER is was right behind my parked car.  I was driving back to Anchorage, it was late, and I parked in a rest area about 25 miles from Glennallen, Alaska.  No houses or buildings for several miles from the rest or pull off area.A large tractor trailer truck, that had not been there when I pulled into the rest area, was there after the bright light (which gave off a loud humming noise) shot off toward the South West.  I had gotton out of the car to try to figure out what was going on.I was very suprised to see the truck.  I didn&apos;t hear it come into the rest area, and it was parked 20-30 feet from the front of my Audi sedan.  I ran to the driver&apos;s door on the truck. The driver just looked at me and said something like you see things out here at night that no one would believe, or words to the effect.  I was pretty excitited at the time.This happened 18 years ago.  I had no idea who to tell it to or report it to until seeing something about the National UFO Reporting Center on TV last night on the History Channel.  Also, I was concerned about saying anything to anyone other than my wife as it could have effected my professional life.I did not see what looked like a craft.  The light was so bright and it moved so fast I was simply stunned.  The humming noise was very loud.  I can only descpribe is a &quot;electrical&quot; in nature.  No other way to describe the sound other than the volume.I believe there is more to this.  However, in an effort to keep from sounding like I&apos;m crazy I will leave this report as is.  It was the strangest experience of my life.  I do not drink or do drugs.  Never have.  It would be possible for someone to think I was under the influance after giving the full details of the incident.  I don&apos;t believe I was abducted.

It was dusky dark and the road I was on has two sharp curves the first is to the left and as I turned the curve I noticed a red light coming straight up from a tree line in the east. At first I thought it was an antenna tower from the hills in that direction because it was flashing slowly, bright to dim and back again. It looked as if it were at least a mile away so I didn&rsquo;t think much of it but it kept getting higher so I stopped my truck and watched. The light first came straight up then it went northwest. It dimmed and changed from red to white dimmed and then changed red again. From the moment it change direction it started moving faster, at first I thought it was a plane but it ended up going much to fast for a plane. It dimmed and it just blinked out. I sat there for a minute trying to figure out what I saw, then two jets flying staggered but side by side came from the same direction as the light did and disappeared behind the hill. It really started to make me wonder what I had seen. The light didn&rsquo;t disappear behind the hill it just disappeared. Then I seen the two jets fly over and I could follow them the whole way.  The jets appeared just only a minute after I seen the light. I got freaked out and went to my house got my mother and took her to were I saw the light and told her what I had seen.

It made no noise and seemed to be followed by a single engine aircraft. I was able to take two photos of the object and two photos of the aircraft.

I saw a large stationary craft and in a moment or so smaller craft emerged single file almost, first to the west then from the opposite side of the craft to the east but this was going on simultaneously. About a dozen in each direction emerged, (without counting)  I was then urged to look to my left and up to the tree under which I saw a ball of white light smaller, but not much, than a basketball.It appeared to have an intelligent presence and was observing me from a distance of only about 15 feet.Seconds later, as though driven away by my attitude it took off in a westerly direction climbing at an angle of about 60 degrees. As it did so it elongated into a tail of light then disappeared, not in the distance but simply a short distance away - it just vanished. Time travelling came to mind.The weidest thing was that throughout as is often the case it appeared as a normal circumstance and nothing to worry about and this feeling lasted for three weeks after which time it literally wore off and I freeked out.I also want to record several other sightings.Several times around 2000 I witnessed the searchlight which seemed to go on forever but unlike some other sightings I believe I was given an explanation on one of these occasions and far more detailed and absolutely fascinating observations.The searchlight emanated from a stationary craft, quite close, in the sky and went to and fro ad nauseum , not on the ground but on thin air! in the sky around an axis point roughly level with the originating craft on the horizontal plane, in an arc of around 130 to 150 degrees of a circle.to and fro, to and fro ad nauseum. the &apos;spotlight&apos; a kind of end circle with the conical beam just like you see normally but only a short distance from the originating craft . Hard to tell air distances but around 100 feet at a guess. But on one occasion it got very interesting and I was told to watch this... a narrow beam of light shot out from the originating craft independent of the searchlight bisecting the searchlight arc and stopping at its extreme perimeter. this then disappeared and a blue rectangle of light appeared vertically over the area of the arc search in a flash and remained for a moment or two then that too disappeared. It seemed to my mind and I don&apos;t know how , except to say intuitively that the narrow beam was like a fishing line and that the rectangle of light was the hook which retreived the INFORMATION, the whole point of the exercise, that the searchlight had been gathering about the people below it asleep in their homes and or the physical environment and that when these two lights disappeared the information was retreived safely on board the space craft. I found the whole thing fascinating and still do. Now why did they want to show me these things unless they were friendly craft - right?

When our aircraft was less than four hours from destination, perhaps in the vicinity of Iceland, sometime after 5 a.m. GMT, the sky was still dark.  While my sister went to the lavatory, I moved over into her window seat to see if there was light on the horizon. Situated several rows behind the port wing, I noticed a spherical red light toward the rear of the aircraft. At first, I wondered if it was attached to the tail, since it appeared close and much larger than the stars, the same apparent size as the wing light, though less bright.  That I immediately ruled out, as it was too far away from the plane.  It was impossible to tell if this sphere was a glowing object at some distance or a light on some larger, dark object at closer range. When my sister returned we both observed this light &ndash; not the regular wing lights and strobe of conventional skycraft, but a single, deep red light or glowing orb that flew at our altitude, keeping pace exactly with our airliner.  We watched it a good thirty seconds before it veered off to the side and receded quickly into the distance.  We must have been flying in some cloud cover because the red object appeared to be increasingly enveloped in fog, the farther away it traveled.  This probably indicates it was closer than another plane should have been or it would have been obscured in the cloud. Upon landing, I decided to quiz the captain, who stood outside the cockpit as we deplaned.  &quot;Did you see that red bogey that was pacing us on the port side at around 5 o&apos;clock?&quot; I asked rather loudly.  He replied that he hadn&apos;t, chuckled and said jokingly, &ldquo;It might have been a UFO.&rdquo;  It was there long enough that I don&apos;t know how he could have missed it. We told all the people we visited in England about our sighting, and one woman said she was relieved to hear someone else describe such a thing, because she had seen something very similar on a night flight.

Before I opened my eyes I wondered if it might be Rudolph the Reindeer. We had watched that show earlier Christmas Eve. When I opened my eyes I have the distinct memory that I knew that I would not be able to move or to speak and that to try would be useless. How did I have that impression when just waking up? I have always had the impression that something had happened previous to this that I have never remembered and that this is what caused me to just know this.

They were each moving rapidly around the room in all directions. As I watched one group of lights I noticed that I could follow them along the floor, up on the wall and then over the ceiling.

I looked across the room and my 5 year old brother was looking at me stunned and seeing the same things. I was very frightened by all of this and tried to move.

It was snowing steadily. I was looking for a place to park and sleep as the next day I wanted to track deer in the new fallen snow. There were no other tracks in the snow so I am sure I was the only person to witness this event.As I passed along the edge of the lake (about 100 yards from the road, right on the shore of the lake), I saw a very bright white light in the upper branches of a tree (maybe 25-30 feet off the ground) across the field. The trees, of course, were bare at that time of year, so I could plainly see the branches both in front of and behind whatever this thing was due to the light. I first thought that it must be a broken power line due to the heavy snow, but I couldn&rsquo;t see any power line. It wasn&rsquo;t moving at all, just flashing in the same position in the tree. I only saw a brilliant white light flashing intensely, very similar to a 4th of July sparkler. I didn&rsquo;t see any flame or sign of fire, which was strange as it seemed to be lodged in the tree branches somehow. I would say the whole &lsquo;thing&rsquo; was about the size of a basketball or slightly larger.I drove down the road and managed to turn around. I came back and stopped the car (same position as before) to watch the light. Finally, after about 10 minutes, I decided to investigate. I opened the car door, felt the cold air, and quickly reconsidered. I was either too lazy or scared to hike over the snowy field to get a better look. I regret that to this day because later I found out there was no power line along the side of the lake.

Our group of camping friends consisted of about 5 families or about 20 people.  We often went to a site that was about 2 hours from where we lived, at Wood Lake, above Harrison Lake 25 miles north of Chilliwack, B.C.  We were about 15 years old and had been enjoying staying up late with the parents.  Between gazing at the campfire and listening to our parent&rsquo;s stories, we would recline in our camp chairs and gaze at the stars, counting the satellites and looking at the stars, in amazement of the beauty of the night sky and what might be &quot;out there.&quot; At approximately 1 AM, we noticed a fairly bright satellite traveling westwards across the sky.  When this satellite was getting close to the half way point across the sky we noticed another bright light traveling at about 5 times the speed of the satellite (it seemed as though it was almost streaking across the sky).  To describe the approach angle of the light heading towards the satellite: if the satellite was traveling from the 6 o&rsquo;clock to the 12 o&rsquo;clock position, the streaking light came from the 4 o&rsquo;clock position.  When the streaking light came within a close distance to the satellite and as though it was about to cross the satellite&rsquo;s path just behind it, it slowed suddenly to match the speed of the satellite and was now on the same path, following it and just slightly to one side.  This portion of the experience happened within the space of about 5 seconds.  The bright light then sped up to get closer to the satellite and kept that closer distance for a few seconds, then accelerated in a zig-zag pattern making sharp angled turns that seemed unrealistic because of the speed and the seemingly impossible sharp angles of the turns, not bends but sharp bends.  When it did this I had the impression it was &quot;checking out&quot; the satellite.  Then after the last &quot;zag,&quot; it sped off faster then it entered the picture, at almost the speed of a falling star, but without the streak of a falling star.  My friend and I watched for a few moments more to watch the satellite and be sure we wouldn&rsquo;t miss something else, then looked at each other and I said: &quot;Did you see that?&quot;  He looked at me with a bit of blank stare for a moment, then said slowly: &quot;yah, I did.&quot;  I asked him what he thought it might have been, and he said I don&rsquo;t know and neither did I. I&rsquo;ve only told a few people over the years about this because I didn&rsquo;t think I would be believed, and sometimes I would begin to doubt the experience myself.  I have tried to reason with this experience and all I could come up with is that it must have been intelligent to do what it did.  I couldn&rsquo;t say that I believe in &quot;aliens,&quot; because I&rsquo;m the type of person that has to see it to believe it.  What I do know from that night is that my friend and I saw my first and only unidentified flying object.", "Stranger square-shaped craft over Delta, B.C.It was raining lightly that night. We  had  left Ladner on Hwy 17 North and were on the southbound exit to Hwy 99, when I first noticed the large bright multi-colored lights (blue, purple, white, orange and green) to the northeast over Surrey.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, but as we neared the Boundary Bay Airport the craft passed over our car and despite the fact that we were going 100 km/h seemed to hover keeping pace with us.  I looked out the passenger window and saw the expansive square-shaped dark grey underside (no identifying markings) with 4 sets of 3 equally  spaced  (about 30+/-10 ft apart) oval lights lined up end-to-end emanating from the center to each corner.  It was no more than 1000 feet off the ground and large enough to block the rain. There were no seams, hatches, flaps, or tail rudders visible, no discernable means of propulsion , and no sound. It continued southwest, and when I last saw the craft it was following Hwy 17 South  in a slow and unhurried manner.The sighting left me shaken and dumbfounded .  I called McCord Air Force Base  about a year ago to see if anyone could help to explain what I had seen, but I have yet to hear from them.As a side note, earlier in the day on our way to Ladner about 13:00 hrs there were Canadian and US Fire Planes flying over the same area.", "A disk flying east-west across the sky in southern Texas. (Padre Islands)I was with my family on vacation down on the Padre Islands in the south of Texas. This long, skinny island is fairly close to the Mexican border. We were staying at the Holiday Inn on the southern part of the island. I decided to go out and take some pictures to see if I could get any cool shots. I fiddled around a bit with some settings and took a few pictures, most of which weren&apos;t very good. As I was aiming a picture of the waves, I noticed a light shooting accross the sky. It was rather sudden and at first I thought it was a shooting star. I continued to look, expecting the light and tail to disintegrate as a shooting star/meteorite would, however it didn&apos;t. I came to the realization at that point that it was something that either entered the atmosphere, or was already in the atmosphere. It had a trail that dissapeared as it got closer to over my head. I continued to watch this spectacle as it shot across the sky at a VERY fast pace. As it flew I thought it was a bird, something simply mistaken for something else. My human curiosity kept me watching this object. I felt my heart drop when the object flew accross the moon. I will never forget the statling image I saw then. A disk shaped object, clearly a disk, shot across the moon, it&apos;s color a light amber, glowing as it were, (possibly from entering the atmosphere.) The image continued it&apos;s east-to-west flight across the sky. As it flew away I could only think of the possible explanations for the object. All my compiled theories shattered when the vessel banked hard left about a thumbs legnth from where I was standing above my hotel. The vessel nearly stopped when it banked left, and it continued it&apos;s path west. I didn&apos;t hear any audible engine sounds, only the slight roar of the ocean.

I naturally assumed it was a plane (we have a small airport relatively close nearby) then noticed it had no wings and was round.

My dad, however, kept watching it out of the corner of his eye while he was driving watching it along with me.The road we were on has big trees periodically as you&apos;re traveling along.

So strange!!  I just figured that the &quot;plane&quot; turned a different direction that we were unable to see?? We came to a stop sign in that particular road and headed north on an intersecting road and this object all of a sudden appeared on my father&apos;s side (who was driving) and I noticed it. If this was a regular plane, we would have seen it continue to fly with us and end up crossing our path (since it was originally flying parallel to us) but it had disappeared behind the trees and then re-appeared on the opposite side of the road. It then continued to drive (seemingly) along with us again!! We were of course paying attention to the road driving and we took our attention away and it disappeared yet again!We all decided this was very odd but dismissed it anyway. THEN ... we made it to our exit onto I-57 headed north (within about 5-6 minutes from last seeing it) and it re-appeared again only this time bigger than it was before. It was flying on the west side of the interstate and was flying much higher this time and faster. It began to speed ahead of us like a shot out of a cannon. Then it suddenly stopped. It was hovering!! Any doubt that I had that this truly was an airplane that I had simply  misunderstood ... vanished when WE ALL saw that thing hovering. There was a semitruck and a couple of cars that were pulled over on the side of the road pointing up at this thing!  We continued to our destination and it was still in the air hovering. I looked back one last time and could not see it. The weirdest thing I ever saw!!! I would never tell anyone for fear of being called a lunatic. I consider myself a reliable source and was not alone in my sighting of this thing. Seeing it on a Sunday morning in broad daylight was also very odd. I always hear of people seeing these things at night with lights but this was in the morning! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The time was between 9:00 and 9:30 p.m. We live in Canton, Michigan, which is located approximately 12 to 15 miles north, northwest of the Detroit Metropolitan airport.  It was a very clear, starry night with a great deal of air traffic. We were looking to the south, above the houses, at the stars.  We thought we were looking at a constellation, but upon closer observation, these two stars were moving in unison from east to west, approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the horizon. They did not appear to be moving fast.  They appeared to be moving about the same as the other air traffic in the sky.  It took them 2 to 3 minutes to move across the sky, east to west.  They also appeared to be moving in the air corridor for take offs and landings from metro airport. The two points of light were approximately 2 inches apart in the sky from our point-of-view and were arranged one above the other, with the top point of light lagging slightly behind the other.  They were points of light that both pulsed from white to red to purple to white again (the colors were not distinct and the light was not strong from our distance). There were no other lights or flashes associated with them like on a plane.  We watched these two points travel across the sky without their formation ever varying in the slightest.  Either the two lights were on opposite ends of an enormous craft or they were intelligently linked and working together in some fashion. I am 45 years old and have been interested in the UFO phenomenon most of my life, but this was the first time I have ever seen anything in the sky that I could not explain.  These two  points of light were unusual and did not appear to aircraft.", "((NUFORC Note:  WE EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE TO MUFON GEORGIA, AND TO ITS DIRECTOR, MR. TOM SHEETS, FOR SHARING THIS CASE WITH NUFORC.  MUFONGA Investigation-Glowing Orb Flies Low Pass Over School BusThe following described event and investigation resulted from a Georgia citizen&apos;s report filed via MUFON&apos;s CMS. On 05Feb07, MUFONGA received the CMS report from MUFON Hqs. and launched an inquiry.  The event occurred on 25Jan07 at about 6:45AM, and involved a witness living in Forsyth County Georgia (about 40 miles NNE of Atlanta).  This writer contacted the witness and found her to be a 45YOA mother and homemaker who wished for her identity to remain confidential for the time being.  For the purpose of this report, she will be referred to only as &quot;Monserrat&quot;, as is her preference in this matter.  Witness was found to be well educated, articulate, seemed forthright, and had traveled and lived internationally during earlier periods in her life.  The witness&apos; neighborhood is upscale suburban, the area also containing small pastures, horses, a few cattle, and MANY children.  She has resided therein for about 3+ years. After the initial conversation with Monserrat, this writer assigned Jim Clifford, a HIGHLY experienced MUFONGA investigator, to visit the event site and conduct a &quot;sit-down&quot; with the witness. Jim interviewed the witness at her home on 9Feb07. Event---- On 25Jan07, Monserrat was going about her early morning routine, getting her children ready for school and so forth.  At about 6:45AM, she walked them out to the bus stop which is only about 20 feet from her driveway.  Some other parents had driven to the bus stop and were sitting in their vehicles up and down the block.   She put her children safely aboard and turned to go back to the house.  At this time, the witness noticed what she initially THOUGHT was a &quot;tossed&quot; ball fly over the bus.  She reacted as most people do when something is tossed, a quick awareness and focus on what has been tossed.  She observed a SOFTBALL SIZED ORB, GLOWING MUCH LIKE AN EMBER FROM A FIRE, SILENTLY FLY OVER THE BUS ABOUT 10 FEET ABOVE THE VEHICLE&apos;S ROOF.She stated that this ORB was gliding along at about 3/4&apos;s LESS VELOCITY than a regular tossed ball. It continued on toward a neighbor&apos;s home across the street, flew OVER the roof and on toward a wooded treeline behind.  During the progress of this slow flight, the ORB grew smaller and smaller, from SOFTBALL SIZE, to about TENNIS BALL SIZE until it VANISHED.  The witness was very surprised, and unfortunately, the other parents did not make the same observation due to sitting in their vehicles. After returning to the house, the witness tried to go on with her normal morning chores, but found herself uncharacteristically fatigued.  She fell into bed and slept soundly for about 4  hours (this extended morning nap being TOTALLY out of character).  She was awakened by the sound of LOW FLYING HELICOPTERS, so low that she indicated the window panes were rattling.  Adding that this had NEVER happened before during their years in the neighborhood, saying there were no military or similar aviation facilities nearby.  Later that evening, at about 8:00PM, she was preparing for her children&apos;s next school day and happened to see a strange light outside and heard what sounded like a tractor in the rear......where no light and no tractor should be.  During this period she heard distant helicopter sounds, and then the low, window rattling fly-over again.  After contemplating all that had occurred, she felt that what she had observed was a living, organic, intelligent entity of some sort, and perhaps the government had also picked up on it. During his visit to the scene, FI Clifford routinely checked the area and orb&apos;s flight path with an EM Field Tester and compass......no unusual readings were noted.   He found nothing else that could be related to the event.  Jim is a retired 20+ years veteran of the U.S. Navy and a communications specialist.  He later checked the various military authorities that might dispatch helo flights into the Forsyth area......no source for the helos was found. The witness recounted her original statement at least three times during this investigation, once to this writer, once to Jim Clifford, and once to the MUFONGA metro staff at a meeting.......consistent throughout, credibility throughout.  Jim Clifford classified this event  as an &quot;Unknown&quot; in MUFON&apos;s CMS.

It resembled a star but then became brighter and brighter orange and then faded to a more dim like star-all the while remaining orange.

Other object red and green and dim.At approximately 9:00 p.m., my husband and son were returning from being out and noticed two objects in the sky near our home when they drove in. One object was Northwest and the other was Southwest. Both were at the same distance in the sky and directly across from each other, by a considerable distance. The object northwest was brighter than any star we have ever seen. Very white and seemed to be flickering mildly. The other object southwest had green and red lights, but fainter in color. Both objects were stationary. My son told us they were probably planets, and we went in the house, not wanting to make a scene in front of the kids. We went back out about an hour later to check and see if they were still there, and they were gone.", "Red light over Lynn, MA.Solid light very high in sky. Then dissappeared.Bright red light.

The object moved similar to a butterfly&apos;s sporadic up and down fluttering, although much faster.

We were perhaps 100 feet away from our friend&rsquo;s home when we both noticed a large, bright green light blinking on something that was moving through the air away from us.  It couldn&rsquo;t have been more than 50 feet above the ground as it moved slowly from our left (south) diagonally away from us toward our right (northwest).  It was approximately two football fields away from us when we first saw it.  All we could see was the extremely large, bright green light blinking on and off for 1 to 1 1/2 seconds at a time.  I realized that I wasn&rsquo;t able to hear any sound coming from whatever it was, so I asked Dave, &quot;Can you hear it?  Can you hear it?!&quot;  To which he replied that he couldn&rsquo;t hear anything from it either.  At that time, I ditched my bike and we both began running toward the object which had by then stopped flashing the green light and began flashing a gold light 10 to 15 feet forward from where the green one had been.  The gold light was as large and as bright as the green one had been, and it was definitely more captivating.  Just as the two of us had reached a full-speed run, the object abruptly changed direction and began flying directly towards us.  There was no curving turn like an airplane would have to make, no sweeping change like a glider, the object just stopped going away from us and began heading immediately toward us.  I think even a helicopter wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to change direction of flight as quick and immediate as the object did.  Then we were scared!   We turned and ran back to our friend&rsquo;s house.  We pounded on the door for him to let us in, and he opened the door just as the object flew directly over our heads.  At that time, there were no longer any lights flashing, but we could hear a faint humming noise.  As the object flew over, all we could see was its black silhouette against the night sky.  We both agreed that it was triangular in shape and small like an ultra-light.  We do not believe it was an ultra-light.  We honestly don&rsquo;t know what it was, but it was the very first time any of us had seen what we believed to be a UFO.", "I was taking a break and laying on the sidewalk in front of our office looking straight up into the sky. The weather was clear, visibility unlimited. A friend was with me. A balloon had floated by us going north. Something caught my eye slightly to my south.It was cigar shaped, very dark color, silent, &amp; no vapor trail. The size was about &frac12; inch between my fingers at arms length. I have no way to estimate actual size and altitude. There were two civilian jets in the sky at high altitude in the area.It traveled on a straight trajectory and covered maybe 10 degrees of arc in 10 or 15 seconds, heading due east. Then it vanished as we were observing it, literally. It was almost directly overhead, slightly to the south of my position.", "Strange Aircraft in the skyMy fianc&eacute;e and I were sitting on our deck eating dinner when we saw a strange aircraft flying from the south heading north over Overland Park at about 8:15 pm.  What I saw in the sky looked like two cones, solid gray in color, with a clear section between the upper and lower sections.  The craft move at a constant speed, altitude and direction across the sky. The craft didn&rsquo;t emit any light but the bottom section was rotating fairly fast.  It seemed to have something offset at about fifteen degrees so as it rotated, the bottom seemed to wobble.  Although the bottom was spinning, the top section was clearly stationary.  It never changed speed or direction and just few out of sight.", "Orange glowing ballHovering over woods deep in the back of mothers home was an orange ball.  Reminds me of a basket ball in shape not very, very bright like a light but more of an internal orange glow.  Did not bounce or move at all just seems like someone placed it in the sky like a picture.  Got out of my car in the subdivison with mouth open and just stared.  There was a person who pulled up along side of me also staring.  He ask me do I see that!  I asked him does he see it!  Very strange first and only experience! Proceeded to mothers house to see if she was o.k.  Woke her up to see if she heard or saw anything.  Went back outside and walked up the street to turn and see if it was still there.

From my angle of view I estimate it was over the James River and aligned towards the SSE. Visibility was a little hazy, but otherwise conditions were very good ( I was wearing prescription,  polarized sunglasses and they allow me to see through haze quite well). There were a few high, scattered clouds and I could tell the craft was below the clouds. At first I thought it was a jet airliner. This is a common enough sight in our area, so I really didn&apos;t give it much thought at first. But the longer I looked at it, the more I realized that it wasn&apos;t behaving the way an airliner would. For one thing, it was barely moving. An airliner would have traversed a good piece of sky in the time I watched it. The other odd thing is that I didn&apos;t see any wings or a tail section. It was a long cylineder, dull gray color and the body seemed to be marked by four, equidistant black lines. I stopped my bike to get a better look at it. Because this is the 400th anniversary of the Jamestowne settlement my next thought was that it was some kind of military aircraft (the POTUS is due to be here on Sunday and security is very high). But it was not a fighter craft, or a helicopter, or a dirigible, or anything else I could recognize. Off to my right I did see a low-flying miliatry helicopter near Jamestown Island, but it was moving away from my position. It was probably part of the security arrangements for the weekend&apos;s festivities. I kept my eye on the cylinder for another minute or so and then it just vanished! One moment it was there and the next it was gone. I scanned the sky for another couple of minutes, but there was nothing there.  I don&apos;t know if it moved off faster than my eyes could track it, or whether it had indeed disappeared. It was quite extraordinary.", "Flashing Lights, Multi-color.I was outside with some friends.  When I saw a light flashing from white to blue to red, and moving in circular motions.  I saw three different objects.  One glowed very bright red and disappeared.  And another was flashing colors and slowly faded out.  Watched this event take place for about 45 minutes.  Another witness claimed he saw the object emitting a red beam.  One of the smaller lights flew into the bigger flashing light and finally disappeared.  All three of my friends clearly saw the same thing I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of Sirius?  Just a guess.

I didn&apos;t realize that was in the shot, I was just trying to  get all of Mt. Rushmore in the picture. Once i pulled my eye away from the view finder, i noticed it. I told my family to quickly turn and see it. The object was there for another good 3-8 seconds. It flew away really quickly but it was just barely slow enough to remain visible as it traveled, until it was out of sight. It seemed to be emitting some sort of aura, but it was difficult to tell because it was such a hazy day.", "Very small object seen above north park lake in pittsburgh,We were driving by north park, right by the drying up lake, when on the other side we saw what seemed like high beams shining directly at us.  It was strange because there isn&apos;t a road passing directly from that angle to get a light from that direction.  Looking low across that way we saw a very small area of light shining on the lake, definitely not a moon or star shine, very direct and focused, like a very high powered flashlight shining on one specific spot of the water for probably about 15 seconds.  We were stopped in the road previously, but pulled over at this point to the no parking, jogging lane.  We thought it was a helicopter with no thought of it being anything more than the police looking for some convict who idiodicly jumped in a freezing lake.  But there was not a sound to be heard, literally nothing but wind and the sound of ourselves walking and breathing.  I was then focused on how intense the beam was on the water, by that I mean that I could actually see some detail beneath the murky water, which I never noticed before on a clear day, yet alone at night.  This didn&apos;t last much longer before the light dimmed significantly and moved towards the edge of the lake, past the top of a pavilion close to the edge of the lake and moved off over the trees in the opposite direction.  I&apos;m just guessing time but this whole period was very short, enough to for us to pull over and walk out of the car to move closer by moving over the guard rail and towards the lake thorough the narrow line of trees.  Then my friend said that the light is over there and pointed up above the trees, I felt like an idiot for not noticing until now but the source was right above us just barely over the treeline on the opposite side of the lake, which was only about 200 yards or so from where we were standing, if that.  Now I don&apos;t know if it really moved away as it seemed and this was another one, or it was the same with a roving light source  The thing itself couldn&apos;t have been large enough for any norma! l sized human being to even come close to fitting inside of.  It was miniscule, not much bigger than the size of a large streetlight and it definitely was not part of a larger object.  It then turned from white to a darker amber shade, but was still bright and very noticeable, but there didn&apos;t seem to be any noticeable direct light shining off onto any objects around us at this point.  The only point that was noticeable now was the source itself  Then it slowly started to move off to the side, moved down below the treeline, back up above, then moved slightly faster, but still slowly, away from us.  I&apos;m not sure if it just turned off, disappeared, or we just lost sight in the trees at this point, but that is the last I saw of it.  We drove over to the other side after this and went right down below where it was.  Maybe we just couldn&apos;t notice in the dark, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary to any of our senses.  Literally, it passed barely over the treeline here, but nothing was out of the ordinary to direct sight or smell.  The three of us were 100% free of all intoxicants except for diet cokes (caffeine) from dinner at a local restaurant at this point.  The one glass of wine I&apos;ve had to this point has only been half enjoyed while I am writing this.  I thought it very strange by the size of the light/object and now that I&apos;ve had time to think about it I&apos;m wondering if the light we saw on the lake was in fact this object itself, or a light shining down from this object while it was above the trees.  I&apos;ve only read about strange objects this size in connection with crop circles, but we&apos;ve never had anything remotely like that in this area and this didn&apos;t seem to be causing that type of phenomenon in any way whatsoever.  If anyone has seen these in the area, or knows more about what this might be we would be very interested in hearing about it.", "Matte black object on clear sunny day at est. 15,000 feet with three witnessesTwo of my co-workers and I were out having a cigarette break and enjoying our beautiful cloudless day just now.  Looking up in the sky I caught a black circular object.  It was high in the sky and moving smoothly south. I pointed it out two my two co-workers who also clearly saw the object. We tracked it with our eyes for about two minutes. It was clear to the three of us this was neither a bird nor a plane.  As luck would have it, a flock of Canadian geese AND a passenger jet flew by while the object was still in sight. (We are about 15 miles west of O&apos;Hare International Airport and we have a lot of geese this time of year). Based on the comparison of the geese flight and the airliner, it looked to be considerably higher than the airliner.  The airliner was 15 miles west of O&apos;Hare and continuing west and looked to be about 10,000 feet and climbing.  The object crossed paths with it, so we had a great angle to judge this by. As for the object&apos;s appearance, it was pitch black with no reflective surface on this very sunny, clear day.  The airliner by contrast was very reflective and bright. Because of this matte, black appearance we would only be guessing at the object&apos;s real shape.  Because of the distance, our eyes condensed it to &quot;circular&quot;. I called the Great Lakes Regional FAA Center in DesPlaines, IL.  They passed me to their operations center and took my name and phone number. We as a group are certain this was no normal aircraft. *It was higher than 10,000 feet, ruling out birds.*Because of this height, the size had to be considerably large.*It was matte black and non-reflective, ruling out weather balloons or commercial aircraft.*It was clearly odd-shaped, not conforming to normal silhouettes.

It was between 10:30 and 11:00 PM and I do not recall what the night sky was like as to clouds or moon.  This stretch of highway is very rural with few farms and homes.  The road is winding and the countryside hilly.  I noticed that the embankment along the road was getting brighter and thought that it was strange how bright my headlights had become.  I looked up and saw approaching from the east/southeast and to the right in my windshield an UFO.  This UFO appeared about twice the size of a full moon.  The object was spherical with 6 rows of oval or elliptical windows; 3 rows above and 3 rows below an imaginary horizontal center line.  The light glowing from within was a butterscotch yellow color.  At approximately 2 o&apos;clock and 8 o&apos;clock as if on a clock face there were two protrusions that resembled bolts of lightning.  At each bend in the &apos;lightning bolt&apos; there was a blinking white light.  Each light blinked on and off in succession on each side of the craft.

The longer dimension of it went side-to-side and it was tilted left-side-down, about 20 degrees, and moving in that direction. It looked to be descending slightly.I would have thought that it was nothing more than a wisp of cloud except that it was moving extremely fast. I can not make a fair estimate, but its speed was orders of magnitude faster than a prop-plane. I witnessed a plane flying much closer to me (I was passing a small airport at the time) and the speed of that plane seemed almost nill compared to the UFO. I would estimate that I first noticed it at a distance of several miles and it traveled several miles in the time I witnessed it.The highway I was on was bending right while the craft was moving left.

The other entry has it dated 10/30/1996 however I was a young kid Trick-Or-Treating at the time and I&apos;m nearly positive it was the night of Halloween 1996.As a large group of family were walking down the street trick-or-treating we spotted 3 stationary lights in the sky. The lights were seen through cloud cover so no actual object was seen, and I can&apos;t be sure if the lights belonged to one object or multiple objects. The 3 lights were flashing in sequence, however I can&apos;t remember in which direction. The other report states it was right to left, but I honestly can&apos;t remember that detail.The next day we heard on the news that many others had seen the lights and there was no explanation for them.", "Large, cigar-shaped aircraft with evenly spaced windows drifted silently over the tree tops at night.I was nine years of age in the summer of 1958 and the sighting occurred at our family home about ten miles east of Castle Rock, Washington as my mother was tucking my two younger brothers and me into bed. We shared a single bedroom and my bed sat against the rear wall of the house off to one side of the bunk beds where my brothers slept. The windows were wide and narrow and high up near the ceiling. As my mother knelt down to kiss me good night, her attention was suddenly diverted by something that caught her eye as she glanced up through the window. Her face grew very serious then paled and her expression faded from curiosity to astonishment and then fear. Her expression frightened me and she failed to respond when I asked her what was wrong several times. I was afraid to look out the window myself because of the fear I saw in my mother&rsquo;s face. The following morning she told me she had looked out the window into the darkness just as a very large cigar-shaped silhouette glided silently into her view from her right (east), barely clearing the tops of the eighty-foot fir trees in the forest that began fifty yards behind our house. She said that she first thought she was witnessing a passenger airliner about to crash but then realized it was moving so slowly that it was nearly hovering and that there was absolutely no engine noise. She thought this was odd, because it was so close she thought she should be hearing something. She said as the object passed her field of view, she could see windows glowing with yellow light spaced evenly along the sides and even thought she may have caught a quick glimpse of dark humanoid shadows in one or two of the windows. She said it reminded her of watching a nearby passenger train passing in the night. She continued staring out the window for several seconds after the object drifted out of view, expecting to hear a crash somewhere nearby, but there was no such sound and that confused her even more. My mother called the radio station the following morning and reported what she&rsquo;d seen. The man she talked to said they had received dozens of similar reports from all around the area and that her sighting appeared to be where the sightings first began coming in. He told her the UFO had been tracked on radar across Oregon and into California where it turned west and then disappeared off the screen over the ocean at a very high rate of speed.

The object was saucer &ndash; like in appearance and had lights along the edge blinking one after the other. In relation to a normal sized star the UFO was about ten times the size; the size of a dime if held furthest from your face, only looking at the side view. The UFO traveled at about the speed of an airplane, maybe a little slower and lower to the ground than an aircraft would travel. The distance was about a foot in the sky, in relation to the dime.  After I would say a minute the UFO disappeared.         (MOTHER)At approximately 9:40pm on May 26th, 2007 I was driving West on Orange drive in Vacaville California, when I saw something moving up in the sky.  It was saucer shaped/cylinder and it had rotating blinking lights.  My daughter was in the passenger side of my car and I noticed after a few seconds, she was watching the same thing as me. It was moving West, probably Northwest.  It was the size of quarter, If I was holding a quarter arm length from my face, that would be the approx size.  The quarter being sideways in position. My guess would be it was not flying as high as an airplane, but closer to where an airplane would be if getting ready to head in towards a runway to land.  I continued to drive west on Orange Drive, and my daughter was trying to use her cell phone to video tape this object.  I pulled into the parking lot of Staples and stopped the car so she could aim her cell phone, about this time the object appeared to vanished from where it was traveling, It sort of looked like it in hyper speed turned North , I remember seeing it off in the distance , but I can not be 100 percent sure that is where it went. All this happened in approximately one minute.", "Strange orange light seen south of Madera.  Went to get binoculars and a minute later the light was gone.At 10:30 pm I had arrived at my home when I noticed a bright orange light in the eastern part of the sky.  I watched it for a few seconds to see if it was stationary or was moving.  It was not making any noise, but what attracted me to it was the brightness of it.  When I discerned it was stationary I went back to my car (50&apos; from where I noticed the light) to fetch my binoculars to get a better view of the light. When I returned to where I orginally was at the time when I saw the light, it was gone.  I had not notice any flash or hear any sounds that may have been of a departing craft.  I did notice two seperate sets of aircraft lights that were farther in the distance, but they were flying in opposite directions and all I could see of them was a red light (but I could hear their engines).  I doubt the orange light was a star or planet as it was the brighest object in the sky and was at least 75% brighter then the next brighest object (which is either Venus or Jupitor, I&apos;m not sure, which ever is in the western part of the sky at this time). I did go back outside about twenty minutes later to see if the light had maybe returned.  At this time the moon had risen and I noticed a star or planet to the upper left of the moon.  This was not the same object, but I felt I should note this.", "Green fireball in western Wisconsin sky.This evening we observed a green fireball in the western Wisconsin sky.  It moved from the south to the north and seemed to burn out behind the tree branches. The sky was slightly overcast and the fireball glowed brightly from behind the thin veil of clouds.This is the second green fireball we have reported from our home in the past 10 years.", "Saw a phasing orange/blue circular light , later saw a similar light at a different location in the skyMy friend and I had plans to go out and use his old telescope to check out the full moon and stars.  After he picked me up, we drove to a spot in west Davis, off of a road surrounded by empty fields, somewhere to get away from the city lights.  We really were not that far out, maybe half a mile to a mile from decently lighted areas, but it was the best we could find on the spot.  We arrived at the scene, just off of a two way road at about 10:30 PM.  After spending about 10-15 minutes setting up the telescope, we quickly were able to find and focus in on the moon.  The view was very clean and clear, filling most of the viewfinder.After enjoying the moon for a few minutes, we decided to search for stars.  We turned the telescope the other way, facing north-west.  As my friend tried to focus in on a star at about 10:50 or earlier, I noticed a orange-blue/green light that seemed to be phasing from colored to not visible, or in and out of light, about every 1-2 seconds.  It was brighter than a star, and seemed to be at airplane altitude.  I could not tell how far away it was.  For this reason, I quickly dismissed it as an airplane.  As my friend continued to search for a star for a bit, I tried to figure out the light again.  By this time, the light had not significantly moved in any direction, and appeared stationary to me.  The light was still phasing.  I told my friend to stop bothering with the telescope, and to just look at the light with his naked eye.  We began discussing what it could be.  By now we had both agreed that it was not an airplane because it was not moving significantly, and that it was not a star, because it was a phasing orange blue light. I had him focus in on it with the telescope.  It didn&rsquo;t take long before we found it, and it appeared to look like a ball of orange with a blue aura around the edges.  Also, it seemed to change colors between orange and blue/green  The image was probably less than half the size of what the moon looked on the same telescope, from the same spot.  The oddest part of the object was that the insides of the ball seemed to have little dots and random patterns in them.  When I first noticed, I was instantly reminded of biology videos you see in school, with the cells being looked at from under a microscope with the little dots inside the cells moving around.  It was all very odd.  We could see the ball seemed to change colors from orange to blue/green and combinations of orange/blue.  Both me, and my friend were very confused and didn&rsquo;t understand what it could be.  We also noticed with our naked eyes that the light seemed to be moving a bit.  We were pretty sure that it was not an eye trick, but the object seemed to move side to side. After about 10-15 minutes of watching the object, it began to slowly disappear in a short span of about 10 seconds.  As it continued to phase, it slowly became dimmer, and was gone.  It might have been that the light got further away from us, or that it just stopped being visible.  We did not know what the case was.  This was at 11:06 PM. At 11:14 PM, we saw another light with similar characteristics to the first one, however, it was much closer to the horizon, and must have been at a much farther distance, because the light was very small compared to the old one.  The light appeared to have a more orange/red color and had much more slight back and forth wavy motions to it.  Even under the telescope, the light was a spec compared to the other light.  If I had to guess, I would say it was about 1/8th of the size of the other light that we had through the telescope just minutes before.  We could not see any of the cell type characteristics on the telescope, because the light was just a tiny orange colored dot on it.  We were not sure if this light had any correlation to the previous one, but we did not rule it out, because this one had appeared to us out of nowhere.  At about 11:26, we noticed the light was getting dimmer, until after about 20 seconds we could not see the light anymore. We might have dismissed these lights as something random, but after seeing the craters on the moon so clearly, then seeing the ball of light behaving so oddly and appearing so different, we knew it was not something wrong with our eyes or the telescope.  Something was definitely different here, but what it was, we don&rsquo;t know.  Please feel free to contact me, I am very curious as to what this might have been.", "U.F.O in Youngstown,Ohfrom&gt; YOUNGSTOWN,OHIO SOUTH SIDE OF TOWN MYRTLE AVE.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I forget exactly what year  but I do remember and inncident where I just got dropped off by my friends and I came into the house and saw my mother cooking and she told me to go to bed because I had drank a couple of beers with my friends,so i went and got into my bed which was facing a window and my grandma&apos;s home next door...Usually between the houses  there is a light that comes on automatically in the evening but some reason that night it wasn&apos;t on,so as i laid in my bed staring outside i saw a teardrop shaped craft hover between our houses and as it hovered there I wanted to holler but for some reason i couldnt move a muscle so i was just laying there thinking i was yelling ma but my mouth wasnt working.The craft was a metallic shiny black glowing color actually more beautiful than scary,well after the craft slowly moved off I got my movement back so i ran down stairs and my mom was sitting watching t.v. and the kitchen was all clean as if she hadnt cooked it seemed to me no time went by but an whole hour did...I was telling my mother i saw a U.F.O but she just laughed at me and said go back to bed but the next day on the local news at noon time there was a report that a Liberty,oh police officer  also encountered a craft.also I noticed as i went back to bed the light that was off between the houses was know on.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It did not blink or twinkle in any way but moved steadily along in the direction of the field where two separate government water wells exist.

As I watched it move quickly across the sky it began to grow dimmer and  over a matter of 3-4 seconds it had completely vanished.

All were stationary!On May 9, 2007, I witnessed 5 objects flashing/strobing/oscillating a red light, with steady green and white lights while the object was being quite stationary.  I could not make out the shapes of the objects due to distance (or maybe because they may not have been very large), but through binoculars I could defintely see the activity of the described lights. At first, there was only one object (as described above.) That was at 21:45.  By 0100 a.m. on May 10, there had appeared four more objects, each quite stationary and flashing/strobing red, with steady green and white lights while the objects were collectively quite stationary.  All five objects were in a triangulated pattern covering about a 5-mile area in the sky. These objects were defintely NOT aircraft of any known type.  Even though there was air traffic coming and going from Charoltte-Douglas Airport (some 30 miles away; I live under an existing flight pattern), it was impossible to mistake these five objects as being normal aircraft. The main aspect of these objects was that they did not move!  At whatever altitude they were at, they did not move!!  But, again, there was no mistaking these objects for normal aircraft. The sky was clear, with minimal interference from earlier rain clouds that had passed through.  Normal air traffic was discernable from these objects.  Stars were clearly visible.  Temperature was about 60 degrees. (As an aside - while I was looking at the first red/green/white object, at around 22:15 through binoculars, I distinctly saw and visually tracked [for about 5 seconds] a greyish rectangular object passing through the heavens. I say &quot;the heavens&quot; because that object was definitely outside our atmosphere and passing at maybe 200 miles up. I have seen the space shuttle three times [and even once when it was connected to the space station] as it passed over my area and I knew that the altitude of the shuttle was 200+ miles above me.  When watching this sixth object [just by chance] I had the disctinct feeling that it was at least as high as the shuttle would have been. And that means that this sixth object, to have been visible to me even through binoculars, had to have been a VERY large object.  Rate of speed of this sixth object was half again faster than that of what the shuttle&apos;s speed normally is when in orbit (meaning, this sixth object was moving at 17,500++ mph.) There was NO mistaking this sixth object for space junk, a satellite, the space station or anything other than a VERY large rectangular machine moving from West-to-East at a high speed. All in all, it was quite a night.

All i saw was five white lights moving faster than anything i have ever seen before and doing things that didnt seem logical. By the time i jumped out of the hot tub and ran to the front of the house they were gone and i couldnt find them in the sky again.  The front of the house was also lit up with lights from the street so it wasnt ideal to see anything there. Just before i saw the moving objects out over lake michigan i was watching several airplanes in the area sky and there was absolutely no comparison in the speed or the way these things moved and reacted with eachother.  They seemed to be moveing together but like i said they were going up and down and across from each other as well as moving forward and a high rate of speed.

The separation of the base lights of the triangle shape was almost equal to these previously mentioned stars, with the forward light about twice that separation.  Each object was about 4 degrees apart on a north-south line, and maintained that arrangement during the 45 seconds of observation.

One was moving slightly, for the remainder of the report this one shall be called:A.  The other one shall be called: B.  A was moving slightly, in a circle. B stayed still but it changed shape.  B was like a half-moon at first, but later it looked like two objects and it started moving slightly.  Both objects remained in this manner.  Both were bright.The other 3 witnesses (besides myself) were in a backyard, around the same area.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

My mother observed the blinking object for approximately 10 minutes.  Suddenly, the object ascended straight up within 3-4 seconds.   Immediately, the object changed direction going directly west and downward toward her at a speed that would compute to be thousands of miles per second.  Within 2 seconds the object appeared in her yard  before her as she looked through her storm door.  This object filled the whole area in front of the door and in front of her entire sight.  She felt like she saw only part of the entire object at this time.My mother felt like she could reach out and touch it.  She saw motionless oars or blades - like looking pieces of machinery of the object which she assumed was the bottom of the object. One area  was green among the blades.  There was a circular red light to right 10-15 feet from the main part of object. The red light appeared to be 4-5 inches in diameter.  She stated that the intensity of the light of the object at the time of close observation was equivalent to looking into a well - lit store window at night or of television screen.My mother&rsquo;s overall impression of her close view of the object was as if she were looking at the inside or bottom of an enormous machine.  Everything appeared to be constructed of shiny metal which was thick, heavy and extremely large. Within 2 seconds, the object disappeared w/out movement or sound.My father was sitting in the same room as my mother but was unable to observe because of his immobility due to medical issues.  He can confirm that my mother was awake and communicating this information to him. My mother and father are of sound mind and can produce witnesses of this from relatives, doctors, town librarians, neighbors, friends and others. She is very gifted and well read.

On the second night, we counted 40 in two hours and they didn&apos;t seem to stop, they just kept on coming across the sky. We did notice an anomaly with the sightings. We could almost predict when one was coming because it became very still, there would be no breeze, then we would hear a slight &quot;whoosh&quot; sound and a falling star would fall. Then a few more would come across the sky. The secound night I caught a split second of one on my video camera because it was so bright that it was blinding if you looked at it. We even saw one change course to chase a plane in the sky. This was a very strange thing for us to witness, we felt like we where being invaded and will probably see more tonight.

No moon as I recall, the sky was very black and the stars shone brightly.  My fianc&eacute; at the time (now husband of 22 years) and I were stargazing on the beach off of Lincoln St. on the boardwalk.  To the left of us was Kennedy Space Center, to the right of us The Pier. I would also like to note that there were no launches that night.  Since I grew up in Cape Canaveral this I would have remembered along with seeing these objects. Suddenly out of no where there appeared a very bright light that seemed to change in colors.  The object hovered above the ocean just to the right of the Space Center.  It would move in and outward, then it would appear to rise in the sky and drop suddenly and stop.  It moved in directions that I have never witnessed before!  It made no sound that we could hear, only the oceans waves were heard.  A second object then appeared and both of these moved around almost as if following each other, then at other times they would be doing different things.  One would be moving towards the beach and one would be rising up or down above the ocean.  We both have never seen any aircraft move so effortlessly in a manner that these objects did. My husband and I both asked each other if we were both witnessing the same thing, wondering if we had lost our minds!  We watched the objects for probably a good 15 minutes doing it&rsquo;s dance in the sky.  Suddenly the first one or lead object seemed to move in quickly at us (but still kept a distance away), like it knew we were watching it, then backed off to where it was then in a flash both of them were gone leaving what seemed to be a streak in the dark sky where they had moved so quickly out of our site. Not a trail, but a streak that vanished in a second!  Over the years we have told many of our friends of our experience, but never thought to report the incident until I ran across your site.  I have looked to see if others perhaps saw these objects that night, but did not find any.  Since I can not remember the exact date I will have to estimate it.

It was pretty cold that night and the air was clear.  As we were driving west on Rte. 101 I noticed a large object in the sky moving slowly from north to south.  I pointed it out to my companions and we pulled over and got out of the car to get a better look.When we stopped the object stopped moving. It appeared to be at least a mile or two away and was very large, about the size of a silver dollar held at arm&apos;s length. It was at about 10 o&apos;clock from the horizon. It was an elongated oval shape and perpendicular to the ground. I seemed to have a bump on one side. The object was glowing purple and the raised area was glowing red. There were two rows of orange or yellow lights on the oval part that were flashing in opposite directions around the oval. The overall shape reminded me of one of those children&apos;s tops with the lever that you push up and down to make it spin except slightly flatter and on its side.We watched the object for about 10-15 minutes as it hung there in the sky.  While we were stopped, someone in a pickup truck stopped and asked if we needed help.  We explained what we were doing. He had a CB radio in his truck and I could hear other people on the CB chattering about the object.  He looked with us for a minute or two and left.  We finally decided to go ourselves as the object was just hanging there.  When we started moving the object continued moving slowly south and eventually passed from view.  It moved a little slower than an airplane and seemed to move at a steady speed.When we got back to Nashua my band mate&apos;s girlfriend was waiting up for us.  She was nearly hysterical.  She had been out at a dance class and on her way home had apparently encountered the same object except that it was directly overhead and low to the ground.

At first I thought it was a bird, but it was approximately 10-15,000 feet up, and I quickly realized two things; one, I probably would not be able to see a bird that far up from the ground, and two, it was moving way too fast to be a bird, even with the heavy winds in the area. I watched the object as it crossed the sky, and realized that it was on a straight trajectory to the North, at a very high rate of speed. The thought came into my head that it must be a Military Fighter Jet, however as I lost sight of it, I realized that given the speed it was traveling, I should have heard some type of sound....there was none. One of my co-workers was also on break at the time, and noticed me looking to the sky. She looked up and saw the object as I did, and wondered if it was a jet. I told her that I wasn&apos;t sure, given that there was no noise. I may not be an aerospace engineer, but I have been to every Muskegon Air Fair since the age of 5, and I know that you can still hear the jet engines of a Military Fighter Jet as far up as 25-30,000 feet.

We had both taken some time this weekend to drive up to Manistee for a weekend of backpacking.  We decided to take the Manistee River trail up the river and than the North Country trail to loop back around.  We unfortunately arrived later than we had planned and set onto the trail knowing that it would be getting dark in only a few hours.  As we hiked along, we made the decision to veer off the path and followed slagle creek North East from the place where it passed under the trail bridge.  It was already getting dark, but a sense of adventure and flashlights assisted our exploration.  Eventually, as we were seeking a clear and comfortable spot to set up camp for the night, it became quite pitch dark.  We began to observe however, that up ahead of us some ways was what seemed to be a rather bright ring of light illuminating a section of forest up ahead.  It was obscurred in distant trees, but was assumed by us to have been a camp set up or possibly a few vehicles parked in a clearing with their lights on. As we continued in a direction that brought us closer to the spot where the lights were, we were surprised to not hear human voices or the sound of engines, rather, a different sound, one more like fans running or the hum of a dehumidifier only much more intense, almost pulsing.  We were at first very intrigued, then when we couldnt explain the scene we became confused. We approached carefully with our flashlights now off as the spot with the lights was 50-75 yards away and seemed bright enough to allow us to navigate safely towards it.  We got to a point where I could tell that the spot in which it was seemed to be a clearing or treeless spot, and the there was a definite structure sitting there which looked as if its sides or its underneath had lights surrounding it.  I would guess from the position of the lights that the object was round, but I cannot be sure.  Also, we both believe that it was most likely and aproximately 20 feet in di ameter.  We probably came within 30 or so yards from it, but at that point I refused to get any closer.  In fact, after watching it for about 5 mins.,  I was ready to get the hell out of there.  My brain could not explain what my eyes saw, it was not normal,  and the only explanation I have was that it must have been something extraterrestrial, or extremely experimental. We turned around and started heading back in a direction away from the scene, our backs turned toward the lights.  It was a hurried but carefull flight to find somewhere we felt more safe.  I remember hearing the humming sound fade as we pressed our way back through branches and brush.  I had to turn my flash light on and we were concentrating on what was ahead of us, but when we did look back the lights were gone. We finally set up a camp near the creek and resolved to go back to where we were durring the daylight.  The next morning we did explore the area we had hiked to, but were not sure and unable to agree on where we had been the night before.  We found a few clearings and open type areas, some with pressed down and flattened grass that could have been the spots but niether of us were sure. Over the next two days we finished our layed back hike, although I still feel that we experienced something not of this world, and I cant even begin to describe the oddity of seeing something that you cant explain, even after ruling out all logical possibilities in your head.When I returned home I got out some maps and tryed to determine exactly where we were at at the time of the sitting. I know for a fact that we were east of the Manistee River and the trail but certainly west of No. 1 road, and we were most likely North of S. Slagle Creek Rd. and somewhere south of Slagle Creek Rd./Blueberry Ln.This was the strangest thing I have ever experienced in my life.

It was a warm summer night up near Wichita Falls, Texas. This town is located in North central Texas, not very far from the Oklahoma border where the Red River separates the two states.  My two friends and I decided to take our 22 caliber rifles and see if we could possibly find some rabbits to shoot at.  I know it sounds cruel, but boys will be boys and I haven&rsquo;t killed any game in years and have no intention to do so.  We all learn from our mistakes.We got in one of my friend&rsquo;s car, a Mustang, and drove West past a town called Iowa Park, my hometown.  We continued driving West until we turned onto a Farm to Market road that led to a town called Holliday, Texas. We again turned West and went down a dirt road that led to a ranch.  The name was posted on a sign there, but it&rsquo;s been too many years to recall the name of the ranch.  We didn&rsquo;t find any rabbits, which we thought was odd, but after shooting our three 22 rifles empty into a ravine we decided it was time to go.It was about 12:30 or 1 a.m. at this time.  After traveling back down the dirt road we rounded a hill, and I saw something behind me.  I turned around and there was a bright orange glowing saucer shaped object about telephone pole high over the road directly behind us. I yelled at my two friends in the front of the car and they looked around and saw it too.  My friend that was driving punched the gas and we were literally floating on the rocks of the dirt road trying to get away as we were all so scared. I told him to slow down as he was going to wreck us,  and he did,  and I asked him to shut off the lights of the car.  He was able to do this as there was enough light from the moon to see by. The orange glowing object was still following us.  I asked him to just shut off the car and see what happened.  We coasted to a stop with the lights off and as soon as we stopped completely, it disappeared. We looked around and it was now over a barbed-wire fence over some property next to us.  It had moved so fast from behind us, it appeared to have just vanished.  We couldn&rsquo;t understand how it had moved so fast we didn&rsquo;t see it do so. I asked my friend to start the car and see if we could slowly move away without it following us, but it continued to move the exact speed that we were traveling as though it was somehow able to match our speed exactly.  Almost as though it was somehow locked onto us somehow.  We again turned off the car.  We talked about getting out and even joked about reloading our rifles  and shooting at it, but no one in that car was about to get out and shoot at it.  We were too scared to even get out of the car. We got very quite and stopped talking as the realization of what was happening finally sunk in.  We don&rsquo;t know what really happened past this point.  The next thing we know we felt like we had all been sort of frozen, looking at it for a long time, and the first thing we remember is we all saw it streak away until it was just a speck and then it was gone.We started the car and drove back into Wichita Falls where we all stayed that night.  I remember that it strange that we didn&rsquo;t remember talking about it on the way back to town.  We told a few people about seeing it, but of &lsquo;course they all had something to comment on, like what had we been smoking? That night we were cold sober and hadn&rsquo;t had anything to drink as we never went shooting firearms if we&rsquo;d had anything to drink.A couple of days later our local TV station had an interview with an older couple that lived in my hometown.  They told of an incident where the wife had seen an orange glowing flying saucer shaped object over her back yard while she had gotten up to get some water.  Her husband stated he&rsquo;d had a hard time getting up at his wife&rsquo;s urgent calls, but he had indeed seen something glowing orange that had streaked off into the distance after he had seen it.I looked over at my step-dad, and he was looking at me and starting to understand the story I had told him a couple of days earlier might have been true.The one thing we never could understand was it seemed like we were out there a lot longer than we thought we were as it was very early in the morning when we finally made it back to Wichita Falls.  The object never made any noise.  That was one thing that scared us the most.  That, and the size of it.  It was the width of the two lane road including the ditches.  From barb wire fence to barb wire fence.  We figured the orange glow came from it heating up in the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.  Traveling so fast through the air.  It looked like two perfectly round plates put together with no sharp angles.  It was round on the edges with no windows or other lights visible.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The weather was foggy with a fair amount of snow beginning to fall, accompanied by a moderate breeze.  I&apos;d stopped at a stoplight, located near the old Colorado Springs airport.  To my left (east), about 50 or 60 feet above the ground, I saw 3 identical, white colored, down shining lights (appearing similar to those housed in recessed &quot;can&quot; lighting fixtures); they were very, VERY slowly, smoothly hover-gliding forward, together.  Two slender blue-colored bars of light were positioned behind, and perpendicular to the &quot;nose&quot; light, but within the boundaries of the triangular configuration formed by the larger 3 white lights.  There may have been a small red light located between and/or just behind the blue bar shaped lights.  Due to the time of night and poor weather conditions, I could not see the body of the craft... just the lights on its under belly. At first, I thought the lights were reflections on my windshield, but I couldn&apos;t determine their source.  I looked at other drivers around me to see if they had noticed the lights but they appeared to be oblivious as the weather/visability was poor and the drivers were concentrating on the stoplight, waiting for it to change from red to green. The thick fog and snowfall reflected the street and city lights to provide a sort of overall orange glow.  Thinking that the lights were reflections, I remained still, using the frame of my windshield to verfiy that the lights were indeed moving, and that they weren&apos;t reflections.  The lights continued to glide, VERY slowly, foward. The 3 lights formed an elongated, triangle configuration; one round light in front (&quot;leading&quot; the direction of movement), with 2 identical round lights behind.  The overall size was approximately the size of an USAF F4 or F15. Since all the lights moved with identical speed and direction at the same time, it seemed probable that they were attached to one body.  There was no noise and the craft&apos;s movement left the fog and snowflakes undisturbed. After moving forward, the hovering craft paused, then VERY slowly, smoothly made a slight banking action to it&apos;s right, then slowly and smoothly, (without rotating)it drifted in an easterly direction, to disappear, uncerimoniously into the fog and snowfall. The craft&apos;s hovering was steady and constant, without bounce, shake, waver, list, or yaw; it moved much smoother than a helicopter, seemingly unaffected by the poor weather conditions. It reminded me of a British Harrier, but, again, its movement was much, much slower, unwavering and smoother than that type of craft. The only movement that I can equate this craft&apos;s with are those displayed by some 3D computer generated and animated &quot;futuristic&quot; design aircraft... only this one was real.", "Eight UFO&apos;s over Blackpool, EnglandThe eight objects where seen on a clear night, They where bright orange glittering egg shaped objects, they were travelling south to north and then turning east, then started to clime and disappear into the night sky, The objects did not make any sound, and they all flew in a strait line, and in single file identical to each other, they were quite high up and some distance away.

Our headlights on car were on, we set on the doors with the windows down.  The lights started to move toward us, then a v shaped craft crossed the road no higher than than 6-8ft off the ground.  It was more like a boomerrang shape,one wing longer the other. Seemed very unusual that something like that could fly so low with no noise and uneven wing span. The second craft hooved directly above us. This was the most exciting experince. The craft was also the same shape. No sound until it was directly above our heads.  It sounded like a jet when it begins to land, this craft seemed very interested in us, because it showed the only red,blue,along with white lights above us. This lasted about 4 to 5 minutes.

I was heading west to my parents house on Cliffdale Rd. I saw these two bright lights coming out of the clouds (storm clouds just hit the area.(no rain tho) The clouds were mid altitude to low, running fast west. Now at first I thought they were helicopters, because my parents live right next to Fort Bragg. And it&rsquo;s totally normal to see them in the area. Now what caught my attention was the light as they came out of the clouds (it was kinda dark all around), I thought dam that&rsquo;s cool to be flying and doing that(coming out of a storm like that). I saw them and lost them as I drove. They came out of the clouds and started to head down. Now when I turned into my parents housing area, as I was going down the road and I saw the lights again behind the houses (not right behind the houses) but I could see where they were still moving west and heading down. I pulled into my parents house and ran to the back yard. The lights were bright, very bright. Both the lights seem to be independent from each other but kept a tight formation. One light was a head of the other. As I watch them, they swooped down and started hugging the tree line real close, I mean right down in the tree line. I could see the lights thru the trees, its January and the trees had relatively no leaves on them. They where constantly changing altitude, up, up, up, down, up, down up..etc... Very quick tho. I had a clear line of sight on them, before hugging the tree line. The description of the light was as follow: bright white (dead center) to white/yellowish around its edges. The light was not glowing perfectly around the object but had spikes of lights around it but north, east and west the spikes of light where at there greatest, with a long tail down (kind of like in Christmas cards, how they draw the star of Bethlehem) The tail down was really weird, it sparkled half way down the tail, slightly wavy and sparkling. As I sat there watching them, I really could not focus on them because it was all light. But I did squint m! y eyes a nd I saw a hint of blue and yellow blinking light (only one time) coming from dead center of the object. They got closer and closer down into the tree line and keep moving west right into Fort Bragg. Now I thought of every thing that it could have been. I am a military brat, seen all types of aircraft daytime and nighttime. No way was it a helicopter. If it was they are very irresponsible for flying that low in that kind of weather. Also it moved up and down so fast and tight when hugging the tree line. The other thing that I thought it could be is a flare canister with a parachute that larger military aircraft release. But the wind was strong and they would of flow apart unless they were tied together, if so I didn&rsquo;t see the chute, which I think I should have been seen easily with that large of a light source. And the light was so large that I think that the chute would have caught on fire. Also when they came out of the sky the were coming down at a constant rate and smoothly straighten out before hugging the tree line. The wind was to my back going west but I tried to see if I heard anything but the wind on my ears made that impossible. The light source is what made me think. If it was any type of aircraft the light source completely envelop the whole aircraft. Never seen anything like that. I looked all over the internet and read this whole website trying to validate what I saw. The only thing that I keep reading is that people see a star like object, but I wish people be a bit more detail....thus me writing a lot...PS When I say they flew into Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg is a big base, I don&rsquo;t mean the main base were the housing area is and the PX/BX, mini mall is at. But there is a large area west of bragg that&rsquo;s all impact area and they have drop zones there, field exercise area, etc., also I will be sending you a map as soon as i can get it done.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The thing just sort rose up from behind the trees or maybe off the horizon but it seemed close (approx 100 meters).  It was silent and kind of danced around in a slight &lsquo;zig zag&rsquo; pattern bobbing up and down to the right before changing direction left, then leveling to a straight line and blinking out.  It was at what seemed about tree top level in altitude but it was really hard to determine.  It was strange looking at it.  Judging the true distance and altitude was kind of tough because it looked unreal, literally, like ionized gas, or a hologram.  I don&rsquo;t suppose this is relevant but we were all engaged in very a heated debate discussing the possibility of intelligent life originating elsewhere and the chances of its traveling here, two on one side, one taking a more neutral stance and one the opposite, shouting religious and scientific contentions to support one or rebut the other.  At least one other witness can corroborate and the other two probably would if they could be located; although one was stating disbelief in the whole UFO phenomenon at the time of the encounter.

It was clear blue and was facing the south on the middle of Rocky Pond.  There was snow covering the pond and ground surrounding the pond.  As I had been watching planes fly over at there usual flying altitude (30,000ft+) all day, I gazed up to look for some more planes.   At I would estimate 15,000-20,000ft I noticed an object which I quickly thought as a plane due to its shape.  But the speed which this object was moving there was no way it was a plane.  At this distance it would have taken at least 30 seconds to watch a plane fly over and this object flew over from east to west in the southern sky in about 1 second. I caught the glimpse of it after it was half way over the sky.  It was a diamond-jet shape but much bigger maybe scaled up to about 5 fighter jets.  It was a light gray to silver color but could not get a good idea of any other colors due to the speed it was traveling.  The object was seen by at least one other friend maybe two.", "Myself and another person witnessed two &quot;ghost rockets&quot; while onboard a ship at seaIn 1985, a year after leaving the Coast Guard, I landed a job with the RCA Service Company at the Atlantic Underwater Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) base on Andros Island in the Bahamas.  I lived and worked on Andros for 13 months as a crew member on several different torpedo retrieval boats and also on AUTEC vessels that deployed sensitive sonar testing equipment in the Tongue of the Ocean -- affectionately rendered as the acronym TOTO.During one voyage on an AUTEC vessel in the summer of 1985, we were underway in the channel between the north end of Andros and New Providence islands, bound for a port in West Palm Beach, Florida.During the midnight to four o&apos;clock a.m. watch, my watch partner and I sighted what I would describe as two &quot;ghost rockets&quot; that flew side by side over our ship on a west to east trajectory.  These &quot;rockets&quot; were highly unusual as neither made any sound, were traveling at an oddly slow rate of speed and were visible to us for about 15 seconds.  However, the rockets left behind contrails that glowed brightly and which were &quot;multi-colored,&quot; in that the contrail smoke changed from white to green to blue to pink and then disappeared completely after about ten minutes.  (I estimate that they passed over us at an altitude of about 500 to 1000 feet; both rockets were white-colored and perhaps 25 to 40 feet in length).I never have been able to determine to a 100% certainty whether or not those &quot;rockets&quot; were a part of some sort of secret Navy submarine or destroyer test being conducted in the area; I have always assumed that they were not and for good reason: As an AUTEC vessel, we would definitely have been informed that such a test was being undertaken and subsequently, warned to stay out of the area.  This had always been the Navy&apos;s practice during similar rocket firing tests that I witnessed while working at sea in the same area.After returning from the voyage, I asked a friend at the AUTEC base who worked as a sort of &quot;air and ocean traffic controller&quot; about the incident.  He told me that he had no knowledge of any sort of test-firing of rockets on that night and due to the sensitive nature of his job, he certainly would have been in a position to know.  (And as a very close friend of mine, he would have told me even if it was supposed to be &quot;top secret&quot;).  Again, I have never heard any satisfactory explanation as to exactly what it was we saw that night.  I have also never heard of rockets that travel in such close proximity to each other, i.e., the &quot;side by side&quot; flight that we witnessed, or at such an unusually slow speed.  Since that incident occurred, I have learned that there is a known history of so-called ghost rocket sightings in other parts of the world, particularly in Sweden.", "fishing for ufo&apos;smy freind and i were on a recent fishing trip at night for catfish when a bright red diamond shaped light appeared a few hundred feet above tree level,there was no soundas as the object whent from stationary to moving very fast westward over the lake.the light then went out for about 15 seconds and then came back but more of an orange red color.once it crssed the lake and went over the tree line we lost sight of the object and never saw it again.both of us had never had anything like this happen before so we wanted to share our story to see if anyone else has had a similar experiance.", "UFO with five army helicopters following it over FT BLISSWe were on our way to a restaurant when my sister pointed out a silvery/white cigar shaped object in the sky.  It was still and somewhat blended into the partly cloudy sky, but you could make it out.  It stayed still in the sky for a very long while and even after we came out of the restaurant it was still there. People were calling into the radio station that we were listening to talk and just rant about the strange object in the sky  So it was a fact that numerous people had seen this thing in the sky, but there were no military crafts around it. Then the sun set and the objected move towards the military base where were stationed at even over our neighborhood.  There were about five ARMY HELICOPTERS surrounding it and the object was VERY LOW about the same level as the helicopters.  The object&apos;s light was glowing red, purple, yellow and blue and it kept changing colors.  It looked as if maybe the objected landed but im not sure.The object disappeared and then so did the army helicopters.

I often scan the skies for anything interesting, and I noticed what appeared to be a distant and slow moving object at about the 10 o&apos;clock position traveling from north to south. I went inside to get my Kodak P712 digital camera, which has a 10x optical zoom lens, hoping to get a better look. Upon, returning I did not see the object, and thought it might have passed behind a cloud.  I sat back down to enjoy the sunset, and after a few minutes a bright pinpoint of light caught my eye off to my left as it continued moving slowly south through a clear patch of sky at about the 11 o&apos;clock position. I could see the bright spot very clearly, and was able to point it out to my 5 year old son. My wife, who was also present, did not see it; she had been facing the opposite direction.  I momentarily lost sight of it while readying my camera, but decided to snap some photos of the area anyway. I was very pleased when one of them captured the object. My only regret was that the camera was set to 3.1-mega pixels instead of its maximum of 7.2-mega pixels. The object was definitely three dimensional, and traveling at a slight upwards angle as it moved from north to south. A friend of mine once said that he did not believe in UFO&rsquo;s, and if they were real, how come he had never seen one?

There was no noise, however moments later a flash from the north could be seen reflected off the clouds. The flash may have been a coincidental lightning flash - however, after remaining watching the north for some minutes, no other flashes occurred.

I found it disturbing because I could not determine the reason I had awoken. I did not usually wake for no reason. I felt alert and full of adrenaline. I then noticed my old cat looking at something outside. This itself would normally be very odd. She was old and almost blind. She never focused on anything including me. That is when a spotlight illuminated my room for an instant moving from N to W. My room had 3 large (4 ft tall, 1.5 ft wide) windows facing directly south and one window facing west. I quickly pulled my blinds up on 2 of the south facing windows hoping to catch a glimpse of it. My house is close to Cecil field airbase and our house was directly in the path of P-31 Orions on landing approach which normally fly E to W. They never illuminated my room. Sometimes, our local Sheriff  helicopters fly over too which is what I expected to see. They had illuminated my room before but they flew higher, their light was not as blinding, and they tended to fly in circles which this did not do. They also tended to make noise. I was surprised to see a dark circular craft hovering over some nearby tree lines. There was no sound. None. It had an Extremely bright spotlight which was very Blue in color. The craft was moving NNW and its path took it just past my house and past my backyard. I estimated the craft to be hovering at a very low altitude. 50-75 feet above the ground. As it moved, it was also moving its spotlight. After I had opened my blinds, the light had been refocused at the street 60 feet away (South of me) and just to the right of the craft straight down. Again, if facing my house from the north, to the right of my house and south 50 feet on our street. It moved the light quickly north, then northwest and then again into my bedroom where it then stayed (obscuring my view of the craft for most of its time within my vision) focused on me as the UFO moved towards, and then past my house. I would estimate its speed at 20 mph.I tri! ed looki ng through my west facing window and watched the light as it moved to the neighbor&apos;s house directly behind mine and then northward out of view. I never heard of other reports and did not bring it up because it greatly disturbed me. I didnt sleep the rest of the night. I cannot stress how errie it was that there was no sound at all. Were there sound, everything about the incident would scream normal sheriff helicopter activity. There was just absolutely no sound at all, completly silent, and it seemed much lower than I normally observed local helicopters.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was on the east side of the complex, and instantly notice two bright white/red lights due east of my position.  The lights were low in the sky, maybe 5-10 degrees above the &ldquo;horizon&rdquo;.  Positioned horizontally level with each other, the lights were separated by about the distance between my hands when my arms were extended straight out from my body.  They lights themselves appeared much larger than any other stars or lights in the sky.  My guess, due to the size of the lights, would be within 1/2 mile of my position.  Neither light appeared to be in motion of any direction, there was absolutely no sound being emitted from either light source.  After observing the lights for about 3 minutes, a third light exactly similar to the other two appeared due south of the original pair, maybe a mile or two away.  From my perspective, it too was stationary. The thing that caught my attention most was the brightness and the clarity of the lights.  The light was not being &ldquo;beamed&rdquo; down or away from the source, nor was it &ldquo;blinding&rdquo; in any fashion.  It is best described as &ldquo;clear and pure&rdquo; white light, very warm without any pulsation visible.  All three sources emitted the same intensity of white light, which created a &ldquo;4-point&rdquo; star effect with two points up/down, and two points each left/right of the source.  What appeared to be emitting from behind each white light source was an equally bright and intense red light, whose points appeared to be along the axis of NW/NE/SW/SE when compared to the white points of light.  I describe the red lights as behind the white lights only from the stand point that the red light spheres appeared to be slightly larger than the white light, and the points of red only shown in between the points of white. All three lights were much larger than any visible stars.  Also they were larger to any &ldquo;aircraft&rdquo; lights as they would normally be viewed.  All three lights remained constantly stationary.  Suddenly the light that appeared after the first two, emitted only a visible red light for about 2 seconds then was &ldquo;gone&rdquo; or out of sight.  No noticeable movement or sound was detected.  Then the southern lights of the two original lights appeared to dissipate in the same way: Only the red light visible for a brief moment, then instantly gone.  I viewed the remaining light for another 30 seconds or so, then had to return inside.", "Small disk shaped object high in sky quickly appeared and disappeared on May 8th at 6:21pm.On May 8th, at about 6:21pm with a bright blue and completely cloudless sky, very high up to the north I saw a normal plane ascending with a very visible contrail.  Immediately after seeing this plane, I looked directly upwards (east) and saw an almond shaped disk with a red bottom and a light reflecting off the silver of the body.  It don&apos;t believe it was a plane as there were no wings and it was too short.  There were no lights or contrail.  It was also too high to be a helicopter and there was no propeller.  I tried to visually follow the path of the disk which had disappeared within seconds.  Strangely, the plane to the left which had previously left a contrail was also gone with no remnants of the contrail.  If there had been any cloud cover whatsoever, I would have just assumed that the plane took off above the clouds and that the disk shaped object was aircraft as it would have been obscured by the clouds.

Suddenly &ldquo;he&rdquo; jerks his head around to the left and looks directly at me.  I become paralyzed and fall off the driveway into the little ditch that boarders the road.  I can still see but cannot move.  The next thing I remember is waking back up in my bed.  The little TV in my room is on and has only &ldquo;snow&rdquo; on the screen.

I had gotten up some time during the night and went back and layed down in my sleeping bag looking at the sky through the trees. From a northern direction I saw a silver disk of bright light.  It was a little smaller than the full moon but was the same kind of silvery light as the moon and was very high in altitude.  It was hard to gauge its speed or altitude but moved in a pretty much north to south direction at steady pace. As I followed it with my eyes it instantly changed direction to a due east direction.  It didn&apos;t stop, slow down or curve as it changed direstion.  It was going south then it changed directions at perfenct 90 degree angle.

I thought you might be interested sightings I&apos;ve had during my carrier?  In the early 1980&apos;s, I was flying as Captain on an MD80 from DFW to DEN.  Our departure time was approximately 8:00 pm, hazy, but with partial light still in the sky.  Climbing out of DFW on an initial 185 degree heading, and just passing through approximately 1,000&apos; AGL (above the ground), I spotted a very large object out of the copilots window.  I immediately made the statement to my copilot, &quot;What the @#*! is that?&quot;  It appeared to be elongated and &quot;cigar&quot; shaped, a grey metallic looking object, moving very slowing from right to left (west to east), and it appeared to have many small, dark, and slightly fuzzy looking, rectangular &quot;windows&quot; running longitudinally along the length of the object; a line or band of windows?  I immediately called departure control on the radio and asked, &quot;Departure, do you show anything ahead of us on radar&quot;.  He replied, &quot;No, why do you ask?&quot;  I told him I wasn&apos;t sure but that we thought that there was an object out ahead of us. At first seeing the object, which was initially located in the right third of my copilots window from my viewpoint, I thought that it might be the undercarriage of a 747.  The object appeared to be moving very slowly.  However, as we accelerated on climb out, the object did not appear to be changing in size indicating that we were not going to have an immediate collision.  I had seen mirages many times before in the past, and so I initially thought that this might be a mirage.  Because of the hazy sky conditions, moisture in the air, and dusk, it didn&rsquo;t appear to be a mirage, but still a possibility.  As we climbed out of 4500&rsquo;, the object was now leaving us toward the east but still visible in the left third of my windscreen when departure had us turn to the northwest on our way toward Denver. I didn&rsquo;t think much of the incident until years later when I happened to turn the television on during one of my layovers.  The program, &quot;In Search Of&quot; was on and this particular segment was about a sighting over Montreal (Torronto?), Canada.  In that program, several hundred witnesses described exactly what my copilot and I had seen on our departure out of DFW during the same time period.  The announcer stated that through triangulation, the objects length was determined to be 6,000&rsquo; long.  That&rsquo;s a mile long and would explain why it appeared that we were not closing on the object we saw!  I thought my sighting above might have some interest for your research?  Other pilot friends have had different encounters.  Back in 1979, I was flying with one 707 pilot and he told me that during a nighttime letdown approach into LAX, when still east of Palm Springs, California, he and his Captain had to take evasive action in order to avoid hitting another flying object.  As they pulled back on the stick to avoid colliding with their &ldquo;UFO&rdquo;, they could clearly see inside the &ldquo;cockpit&rdquo; of this craft and clearly saw the &ldquo;pilots&rdquo;.  Both of the American pilots were former USAF pilots and they both knew what oxygen masks looked like, the type worn by military pilots.  What they saw on the &ldquo;UFO pilots&rdquo; face(s), helmet or oxygen masks, they said was nothing they had ever seen before.  In their estimate, it was not of this planet.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was looking westward along a mostly flat ridgeline approximately 7 miles away.  From the north end of the ridgeline, noticeably well above the ridgeline itself (i.e. in the sky), a single light emerged, moving at a relatively slow speed.  Once it had moved along for a few seconds, a 2nd light appeared in trail behind it, emerging from the same location the first one had.The lights continued to move southward, in lock-sync, above the ridge until approximately halfway across.  At that point the lights stopped, in a very odd, mechanical fashion (i.e. there was no deceleration, just instantaneous cessation of movement) and immediately a 3rd light appeared from &quot;behind&quot; the southern-most light and stopped at a symmetrical point with the other 2, forming 3 lights in a straight line and spaced equidistant from each other.The lights sat there motionless for approximately 10 seconds.  At that point, the new light continued southward, and the original 2 lights retraced their original path northward, and all disappeared behind neighboring hills.  The motion again was completely mechanical; instant acceleration and completely synchronized.The lights themselves were single-point white lights, with no other observable characteristics.((personal data deleted))((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed quite sober-minded to us.

It was like if somebody is moving flashlight on the wall or the lights moving on the dance floor.

PD))Multiple-type UFOs are witnessed multiple times, in multiple states, near U.S.A.F. bases in LA and CO.Several other individuals and me have been observing clandestine military &quot;UFOs&quot; for approximately five years now. Two to four distinguishable crafts have been observed during this time period. The locations I speak of are Shreveport, Louisiana area and the Denver, Colorado cosmopolitan center and Bailey, Colorado, approximately 45 miles south of Denver. Both in Shreveport and in Colorado, United States Air Force Bases are nearby. In Colorado the sites are the U.S. Air Force Academy plus NORAD within Cheyenne Mountain in and near Colorado Springs. In Shreveport, Louisiana, the site is Barksdale Air Force Base. I will first comment on the history of others and my observations. Beginning in 2003, my brother, a friend and me began seeing large, glowing and color-changing objects over Lake Bistineau in Bossier Parish about 20 miles from Shreveport and near a very small rural town called Hall Summit. Periodically, on a darkened road very near Hall Summit, LA, my brother and I (and occasionally others brought along)witnessed several aerial crafts in the night sky and depending on the evening of observation, one or more different crafts were observed. Typically, the activity in this country area peaked in the late AM hours, before dawn. However, there was some activity as long as it was dark. The most prominent and constantly witnessed UFO was a large, bright orange oval object in the sky which was capable of hovering, moving at an variable speeds, none of which were considered to be &quot;high-speeds,&quot; as seen in LA, anyway. These identical crafts were also seen hovering above the lake named above with the same light/shape configuration and rapid color changing properties. These &quot;color-changers&quot; were discoid in shape, appeared metallic and when viewed by high-magnification binoculars They all moved from side-to-side or if viewed from directly below,they made small concentric circles as if their propulsion was possibly related to the harnessing of the earth&rsquo;s own (geo)electromagnetism as the movements were identical to that of two magnets of opposing poles when brought close together. The propulsion of these type crafts were silent. The most often seen color was orange, however, all colors of the visible spectrum were viewed at varying times; often the type of craft mentioned cycled through this spectrum rapidly. The &quot;color-changers&quot; were often but not always associated with faster moving crafts we termed &quot;strobers&quot; as they displayed strobe-like qualities flashing intense bluish-white light at extremely high frequency when moving and a slower frequency when  approaching a landing area on government land, in the middle of virtually zero population. They were difficult to look upon as a prolonged gaze requires.Their propulsion was, too, silent. These crafts &quot;buzzed&quot; our vehicle at a very low altitude while stationary or when driving--multiple times over the years. I cannot comment on the shape of these crafts, due to the light intensity. These were much smaller than the above crafts that appeared at least 100-200 ft.in diameter and were rarely witnessed hovering except as they were about to land. They were capable of high-speed maneuvers such as small angle turns and abrupt stops and change of direction without deceleration. These accounts of the aerial ships seen in the country were near government owned land and is inaccessible. One evening at about 4:00 AM CST while driving on a small rural highway nearby, an orange-glowing &quot;color-changer&quot; passed over us at a very low altitude (150-200 ft. perhaps) and my bother and me were within 1 mi. of our usual observation point and we sped there, eyeing the orange ship until we reached our stationary observing position. The huge craft proceeded to land about 1000 to 2000 yards away. Two &quot;strobers&quot; buzzed by us as the larger craft passed over us toward its landing spot. Upon landing, either the orange ship&rsquo;s lights were turned off or it proceeded underground. Too, we had seen lower hovering crafts &quot;cloak&quot; or shutting down their lights.These UFOs seem to be of military association. Gasoline? Free energy appears to have been harnessed. In Denver and Bailey CO, the hovercrafts (&quot;color-changers&quot;) were seen yet in massive numbers, at higher altitudes and typically emanating only bluish-white light. The same small movements--as if magnetically-related propulsion was used--were identical to the ships in LA. An extremely large hoverer appeared over the same mountain peak nightly and the intensity of its white light was remarkable. It was viewed from a much greater distance (~1.5-2 mi.)and using the LA crafts as a reference,was at least 1000 feet across. In Bailey, (not seen in LA) the crafts at higher altitudes often zipped away with no apparent acceleration and, too, could stop on a dime. On an average evening, barring unfavorable weather conditions, there were 30-40 of these objects scattered in the sky. Other times there were much fewer present. They were over the urban area of Denver, also, at relatively low altitudes. I have not returned to the country viewing area in LA for several years. Now, the same &quot;color-changing&rsquo; discoid crafts hover over Shreveport proper, a few at higher altitudes and typically one or two at lower altitudes. The lights however appear to remain white. While hovering, if viewed from binoculars, rapid color changes are seen. Many I know have witnessed these crafts and agree they are presumably military. The last time I spent time observing one of these was April 30, 2007, with a friend, within the city, from my front porch. Their presence in the evening sky is constant. The sightings are regular yet the crafts over the city do not maneuver, they just hover and make their small nutated  movements. The fact I&rsquo;ve read absolutely  no reports of these highly visible &quot;UFOs&quot;  is incredible to me. They need to be evaluated by experts with the proper equipment and brought to the largely unknowing public&rsquo;s awareness given the potentiality for a cheap or free energy source. They are obviously higher aerial technology that has been disclosed and I feel as though they are at least partly used for surveillance/security. They fall under the definition of a UFO as they are not identified. Two other type crafts were witnessed in the country, both similar: rectangular shuttle-like crafts heading in the direction of the Air Force base. Propulsion could be heard (a low uniform hum); these were of such a low-flying altitude (~60 ft.) that 6 (on one of these crafts) to 8 (on the other)circular propulsion devices were viewed beneath each &quot;shuttle.&quot; Windows were present on the crafts&apos; front which were very small and rectangular. Side windows were large and square with yellow light inside seen along with human shaped figures near the windows. There were no exterior lights present on either and an estimated speed of both is 40-50 mph: an atypical, very slow speed for an object of their size and apparent weight. The rectangular humming crafts appeared 40-50 ft.long by 15 ft. wide. The high level of activity in the region warrants investigation. I have seen the same hover-type crafts not only in the two locations mentioned but everywhere I have traveled within the U.S. I am an M.D. and a trained observer. To let this slip by without investigation would be tantamount to continuing to allowing the government and its military to fund and operate these specialized crafts without inquiry and to continue to use hidden, inexpensive propulsion, likely in most cases presented above, to be geo-electromagnetism harnessed and likely regenerated--for free.

We just picked up a pizza to take home on one of these foggy evenings at this time of year.  The fog was just starting to condense and lower towards the ground as it was visible by the city lights. It was already dark and you could see the moon rising to our left. I was a passenger in the car and noted to my co-occupant that the moon was rising. And then I saw another more bright, round sphere-shaped object coming from the left side of the vehicle. It appeared at first to be the same size as the moon. But it moved steadily and became brighter as it crossed our plane of view from left to right,(East to West). The object was a bright white lighted sphere, a completely round ball. It&apos;s size seemed to be approx. 15-20 feet in diameter. As it moved I got the attention of the person with me and alerted him to it. That is when I noticed that he was in a state of mild shock, for he would never believe in anything like UFO&apos;s, ghosts or any thing out of the ordinary. I quickly focused my eyes on this thing in disbelief myself. It floated slowly in front of us about roughly 1000 ft. away and about 150 feet off the ground. It appeared to be manuevering around trees and it would rise up into the lowering fog layer creating a glow in the fog. It would then drop back down towards the ground. At one point it came close in and I could clearly see that it was a three dimensional object for it had a shadow feature on the bottom and was more bright in the middle and less towards the edges. I got really excited and told my &quot;family member&quot; that we should follow it because it moved slow enough to be pursued. It eventually disappeared behind a hill and then my fellow occupant suddenly grabed me by the neck and very forcefully said in no uncertain terms,&quot;Don&apos;t tell anyone we saw this thing!&quot; And then he just non-chalantly turned the car out onto the main road and drove off a! s if not hing ever happened. I was shocked by his reaction to witnessing this together. For I thought; aha...now lets hear him deny that there are things in this universe that cannot be explained! To this day he claims to have no recollection that we ever saw this thing together. He is either under some kind of spell or in deep denial. It was several months later that my memory of this experience hit me like a sledge hammer and It took me a while to realize It was not some kind of strange day dream. Part of my curiosity about him having such an agressive reaction to something from out of this world is that he is a very close personal friend to an influential congressman and a prominent businessman in the community. His fear would be based on their reputations in the community. So, I remained silent for many years. One strange thing did happen one evening over a card game with some friends and we got on the subject of UFO&apos;s and the like and I told my friends about this experience and Brian suddenly had this wierd look and he recollected a story from a close friend back in Indiana when he was in high school. His friend told him about seeing this exact same thing from a car parked on the side of a country road and it had landed in a recently mowed hay field. They apparently had a good look at it and were able to size it up based on these rolled up balls(bales) of hay. It was three times the size of one of the hay bales, and Brian&apos;s friends brother got out of the car and walked up to it and actually touched it! Later they found themselved in the car together and it was near morning. They claimed to have lost some time. When Brian&apos;s friend came to, his brother grabbed him by the neck and said those exact same words that my &quot;family member&quot; said to me in 1998! &quot;Don&apos;t tell anyone we saw this thing!&quot; Now this really blew me out of the water, because I had always wondered if I was simply loosing touch with reality over this experience. My friend Brian is a musician and business man as well and I have never heard him talk o! r discus s anything outside of this realm of existence. Strange, what is this thing? A probe? A time travel device? There was no sound or other lights around or near the object.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We watched the object until it disappeared on the left side of the V, behind the mountain, and we didn&rsquo;t observe any other noise or light effect after.  It was falling like a star,  But!!!  It was very big, and moved very slowly. I know airplanes, satellites, I watched them a lot, but this was totally different.  As I think it was at an 1-2 Km distance from us.  Or it was further and it was enormous with very high speed.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "hovering saucer&#x5C;cigar shaped object, 4 white lights that changed stationary to sweeping over San Jose for HOURSThere was a cigar shaped aircraft hovering in the northeast sky.  I noticed it about 11 pm while watching for a reported meteor shower expected.  I noticed at first it was entremely bright. Then noticed that an obvious commercial aircraft seemed to be heading for it.  The questioned unidentified aircraft &quot;flashed&quot; lights at the commercial aircraft and the commercial aircraft veered away to an entirely different direction of travel. I got out binoculars and looked closer at the unknown &quot;light&quot; in the sky and realized it was NOT something normal.  It appeared to be cigar or saucer shaped with 4 very bright lights acroos.  Occasionally the lights would dim to the point of being not visible to the naked eye. While observing thru the binoculars I observed that when this happened, the lights on the craft would change shape becoming shaped like a blackslash which grew more and more narrow, over a period of several seconds.  Then the lights would open fully again becoming very very bright.I watched this aircraft for approximately 2 1/2 hours.  During this time NO airplanes whatsoever flew over, which is quite unusual because this is a normal regularly busy flight path for San Francisco airport as well as San Jose. The craft simply hovered there in place.  There has NEVER been anything shaped even similarly in the sky, there is no way this could have been an airplace, helicopter, nothing commonly known.I called my brother, who lives several miles closer to the approximate estimated spot the craft was hovering.  He went outside and IMMEDIATELY spotted it and said, oh *hit, I think we are in trouble.  He too observed the lights on it changing but described that as a &quot;sweeping&quot; function, as tho the craft were searching around it&apos;s perimiter, then would return to the simple hovering state.I noticed my cell phone reception was very poor during this time - background noise, static, bleedover noise.I made a point of observing for a long time, so that i would be certain this was not a product of my imagination or blurred vision or misinterpretation.  IT WAS NOT.", "Bright blue object races across whole sky.I was driving home from work on Monday  night at about 9:35 PM PST. I&rsquo;m majoring in Astronomy and usually gaze at the stars as I drive home during the dark stretches. On Monday night this was the case. Through the front windshield a BRIGHT blue object raced across the sky from East to West at amazing speeds. Keep in mind I&rsquo;m familiar with objects in the sky. This object was blue, It took only 6-10 seconds to cover the WHOLE sky, 180 degrees. It was brighter than any star in the sky, It was too slow to be any debris entering the atmosphere, the color also supports this. It was way to fast to be any earth made aircraft of any kind. Its path was direct and its brightness did not fade as it reached the horizon. I have seen many object in the sky including satellites that I have manually tracked with my telescope. This object was absolutely not a satellite. I hope others saw this as well.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

PD))", "October, 1961, Tulsa Oklahoma: low altitude, slow, disk object(s); high speed turns, v. high accelleration.I was delivering newspapers at approximately 3:30 AM, October 1, 1961 (plus of minus a week), on North Braden Avenue at the corner of East Marshal Street.  It was cold (30-35F) and the sky was clear of clouds.Two circular, saucer-shaped objects flew over me in a North-East direction, generally headed toward the Tulsa airport approximately two and a half miles away.  My estimate at the time was that they were flying at about 250 feet altitude, and were about 80 feet across.  It was relatively easy to judge the distance, as the edges of the saucers were crisply in focus.  There was very faint scoring or scratching on the bottom surface of the saucers, giving a slight textured appearance, which also allowed me to judge altitude better.  They flew at approximately 15-20 MPH (very slowly), and in line (one behind the other, same altitude).  The bottom of the saucers glowed with a golden light that pulsed slowly, in about a 2-3 second cycle from dimmer to lighter and back to dimmer.  The pulsing was very distinct, but not the cycle was not &quot;wide,&quot; in that it was never particularly bright, and always a bit dim.  The saucers were completely silent.  There were no &quot;point&quot; lights, or particular light emitting locations except for the whole of the under surface.The location was very slightly hilly, and the saucers proceeded in a direction directly in line with the street.  I would watch clearly them until they had flown about a mile and a half away.  As they receded, it became apparent that the main bodies of the saucers had the appearance of two thin spherical surfaces, one above and one below, meeting at the edges.  Given the estimate that the saucers were 80 feet in diameter, I estimate that the main body of the saucers were 8 feet thick.The main body of each saucer was surmounted by a translucent (opaque) white dome, rising approximately 4 feet above the main body.  The dome was only a little brighter than the golden bottoms.  There were no &quot;point&quot; sources of light on the dome.  I do not recall that the top surface of the saucers, apart from the domes, glowed; however, it is likely that they did glow only a little dimmer than the bottoms or I would have noticed either that they were dark or that the saucer bodies were uniformly bright, top and bottom.  I do not recall that the dome lighting pulsed.It is possible that my size estimates are too small.  It is possible that the saucers were instead, 125 feet across and 12 feet thick in the main body with a 6-7 foot dome, flying up to but not exceeding 400 feet in altitude.  These sizes are an upper limit and unlikely.At the time I was skilled in aircraft recognition, having been growing up with a parent who was employed at the Tulsa Airport and who kept me well informed about airplanes and air flight mechanics.  I was also a relatively skilled hunter, with a good sense of distance for estimating bullet trajectories for high powered rifles.Naturally, I thought this to be an extraordinary incident, and so I kept my eyes on the sky for many mornings thereafter.  Subsequently, within two or three weeks I saw another saucer, which I will report here as part of the same incident.I was standing at the corner of East Pine and North Yale, approximately half a mile North of the previous sighting, and saw a saucer fly overhead in a South-West direction toward downtown Tulsa, 4 miles away.  The location was elevated sufficiently so that I could see the downtown skyline.  The saucer was the same size and shape, but this time flying silently at 750-1000 feet altitude at perhaps 200-250 MPH.  It glowed with a golden pulsing light, as had the two saucers in the previous sighting.Within perhaps 1 to 1-1/2 minutes, the saucer passed just even with or to the other side of the downtown region and turned Northward at probably the same speed.  From this distance it was a little easier to estimate the altitude, as the profile of the saucer was relatively clear, although distant and therefore a small visual object.  The saucer flew Northward for about a mile, until more or less directly East of me, then abruptly changed both direction and speed.  The saucer abruptly veered upward at about 25 degrees -- a &quot;point-turn&quot; with no curvature to it that I could detect from where I was.  It abruptly increased in speed to what I would estimate to be about 1500 MPH.  I judge this to be the speed from the prior assessment that it was going 250 MPH, and was not going 6-8 times that speed, upward at the 25 degree angle.  It seemed that the saucer accelerated from 250 to 1500 in not more than a few hundred feet, if it took even that distance.  For all I knew, it was instantaneous, since one or two saucer-body lengths in acceleration to that speed would have been indistinguishable from instantaneous.  The saucer continued upward rapidly until I could no longer see it.Within one week more, I saw something that I presumed to be a saucer, also.  From the same location at Pine and Yale, I looked into the sky Southward and a little East, and saw high into the sky (about 55-60 degrees elevation) what appeared to be a meteor entering the atmosphere -- a not uncommon sight.  However, this meteor began to glow, then streaked down at about 150-160 degrees downward Upper Left to Lower Right in my vision, then abruptly slowed and stopped in place, still glowing brightly from what I thought to be heated entry into the atmosphere.  After remaining completely still for approximately 10 seconds, it flew off horizontally to the horizon, Eastward (probably South-East from its stopped position) and disappeared into the distance.  I could not see features on this object, nor its shape.  The event was probably 8-10 miles distant, perhaps in an area 1-3 miles West of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.These three events were the only ones I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I happen to look right above my house at about a thousand feet or so , i noticed this big object. I was kinda of in shock cause i didn&apos;t know what it was , then i told my daughter and her boyfriend to look above the house in the sky and we were speechless,and couldn&apos;t believe our eyes.  It was not an airplane, it had no lights on it, no engine noise.

It had red and green blinking red lights and seemed to stand still on all but one of the occasions.  On that one occasion, it came closer, hovered for awhile and took off at a right angle.  It seemed to go straight up at this right angle, but very fast.  It seemed to be close enough that I would have heard a sound but there was no sound.

The lights were red and blue colored.  I also noticed in the rear bottom of the aircraft there was what I can describe as what looked like a vent.  It was a dull silver color.  What really distinguished this aircraft was that it flew completely silent. It was no more than 100 ft. above my home and there was absolutely no noise. I went back inside to get my wife to show her. When we both stepped outside it was gone.

Still, I appreciate the open and questioning nature of the NUFORC website, and I&rsquo;d like to respond.First of all, I am well aware of the planes towing the banners.  Usually they are for the &quot;12 Oaks&quot; Townhouses.  It couldn&rsquo;t be more obvious that a small plane is towing a white banner with clearly legible type.  Not by any stretch of the imagination is this remotely a possibility for what I saw.  Neither was it a billboard or a streetlight or a street sign.It was a smoky matte black rectangle, close enough so that I could see it was quite large, in the same way that you can quickly tell if a nearby airplane is a child&rsquo;s toy, a small plane like the ones that tow the banners, or a large jumbo jet.  This rectangle was clearly a jumbo.  And it was hanging in the air, moving slowly or possibly not at all when I first sighted it.  It was electrifying to see it, and in one second I ruled out all the usual suspects- a sign, a light, and yes, I even briefly considered a banner as a possibility.  But this was obviously an independent floating or flying craft of some kind, with no supporting poles or strings attached.I got a very clear and long look at the rectangle in a large open area, above the horizon, with no obscuring foliage, as I continued down the raised highway.  It was one of those things I&rsquo;ll remember crystal clearly for the rest of my life.  At this point it was evident that yes, the craft was moving, albeit relatively slowly, much slower than even a small airplane would move.  And the edges were distinct and crisp, although there was an unusual, almost ominous tone to the black color.  It was sort of unearthly, actually, a smoky matte black, as I stated earlier.  I felt that it was metallic.  I believe I was looking at a side panel or back panel or front panel of the craft.  At the time, I thought that the rest of the ship was hidden by perspective, but now I tend to think it was camouflaged with the exception of this one panel, for whatever reason.My great regret is that I didn&rsquo;t stop the car and flag down other motorists to be witnesses.  I thought of doing it, but it would have been very dangerous in the rush-hour traffic with a narrow shoulder, with me not wanting to take my eyes off this incredible ship in the sky.  I&rsquo;m glad I was able to keep looking at it, though, because as I was watching it in this wide-open area it just faded away, or &quot;cloaked out,&quot; before my eyes, as if it realized it was being watched.  Briefly, I could see a diffuse rectangular shape well camouflaged against the blue sky, sort of like a rectangular panel of water hanging in the air might look like from a distance.  The ship definitely disappeared from &quot;cloaking,&quot; as opposed to traveling too quickly to observe.  Absolutely amazing.Since then, I&rsquo;ve researched these types of sightings quite a bit.  The shape I saw is very much like the shape I&rsquo;ve seen witnesses draw of the sides of &quot;black triangles&quot; or similar craft.  Some people believe these are secret American military craft- perhaps a &quot;stealth blimp&quot;- but I find that very hard to believe.  Reports of these types of sightings go back over half a century, and have become quite common the last decade or so.  These ships, usually seen in heavily populated areas, are sometimes seen to move at incredible, apparently instantaneous-type speeds.  I saw one fade from view right before my eyes.  If we&rsquo;ve had these ships for half a century, which in itself is ludicrous, we&rsquo;d have been using them in battle for quite some time now.  I&rsquo;ve seen a Stealth Bomber flying up close, and as awesome as the Stealth Bomber was, I have to say that the black &quot;rectangle&quot; was a lot more amazing.  An advertising banner?  Absolutely not!", "Incredible Sighting and top secret HelicoptersCottonwood, California 4/9/07  it was tonight at 8:03 pm just around nightfall but still light, i looked to the sky and saw a light, figuring it to be a satelite or meteorite, and or comet, but it had no trail, nor any blinking lights, it had a distinct whitish bright color i watched it forever as it seemed, i called my friends over, i was very tensed and said &quot;get over here look!, look!, im not the only one who see&apos;s this im I, and my friend pete was seriously distrought at what he saw, and he ran in the house, i ran, as fast as i could i followed it, it then turned a bright orange, then a bright red, it stopped my friend pete in mid distance as he noticed it change colors in mid run, he stopped i also stopped and as quick as we saw it, it gradually disapeared but it did not just vanish it gradually dissapeared as if going up and up at such an incredible speed and eventually was lost out of sight, and then just as quickly as it happened seven, yes seven black unmarked helicopters flew over head some were cargo some were regular, they flew over head and then the wind, it was incredible the wind kicked up and dust was everywhere it was honestly very very weird and paranormal, they disapeared over the horizen and i couldnt see them anymore as it was getting dark, we saw what we saw and this is very weird, it was tonight ive just got home and im reportig this, somthing very big has just gone down and or somthing big is happening, again im just from a small little town, in california and this is new to me, please someone comment and tell me if anyone else has seen the same.", "I saw 5 flying objects that were light up circling in the sky late at night.My friend and I were at a bonfire at their house and she told me to look up and I did.

This is an update.I made a past report, in 2005 about a UFO I saw in Benbrook Texas.  I have an update.After seeing the UFO, I immediately had to turn off the highway and drive down a dark, hardly used road, with nothing but trees and a couple of buildings. I was scared to drive down it after what I had just witnessed, but I did it anyway.After driving down the dark secluded street, I suddenly slammed on my breaks as there were two huge eyes staring at me. I was frightened and could not figure out what it was. I stared at it, and it stared at me. Then I realized it was a deer. It slowly walked off the road and stood behind the trees and continued to watch me.A couple of days ago, I had my therapist, who is also a nurse practioner, hypnotized me, so I could go back through that night again.Turns out, the eyes did not belong to a deer; I was in fact eye to eye with an alien. It looked just like the typical alien on the front of Communion. I am not a ufo/alien expert. I believe these are called &quot;Greys.&quot;  It did walk very slowly into the woods and continued to stare at me.In my hypnosis, I had a panic attack, and was extremely scared, crying, sweating, and barely able to breathe, so my therapist brought me out of the hypnosis.I have a feeling it was trying to communicate with me, so I wish I could go back and find out, but it was a very terrifying experience for me to relive.I just wanted to send an update.

From it&apos;s path it must have passed very close to my home so I wish I had gotten up a little earlier. I watched it for a good 5 minutes slowly disappear toward poplarville.About two or 3 years ago I was coming home from work after midnight when I had a similar experience while driving down the road. This was very short in duration, lasting maybe 10 seconds, but was an identical luminous white sphere shaped object and about a quarter mile away traveling in the same direction as myself. This UFO was trailing a tail of white fire behind it, which was maybe 3 times its length and the same width as the sphere. It had clear crisp edges and was well defined in the dark sky. I would judge its size to be slightly larger than a quarter from my prospective.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was about 44th st.  I was walking on the west side of the street.I was walking past a Japanese restaurant. I saw two people standing outside, smoking a cigarette (I assume they worked at the restaurant, but didn&rsquo;t ask), and looking up.What I saw (and this is from memory so it isn&rsquo;t great) is a dark grey/black ball, about the size of a basketball.  It was hovering over the building across the street.  The building was about 5-6 stories tall, so my guess is that the object was 70-80 feet above the street.  My first thought was that it was a black plastic bag that had been blown up by wind currents up the side of the building.  But I didn&rsquo;t see any of the loop type handles or an opening.My second thought was that it was a balloon.  I&rsquo;m still not sure that it wasn&rsquo;t that, but either a bag or a balloon would normally move in a thrusting jerky type motion, depending on the wind currents.  This didn&rsquo;t.  At some point after it was hovering, it moved at a slow, but steady pace across/over the street. It took maybe a minute for it to go over say 4-5 lanes of traffic.After that, I lost sight of it as it drifted above the building I was standing in front of.At the time it didn&rsquo;t seem like a typical UFO because I would think of those as more of a craft.

By erratic I mean they were tracing lines back and forth linearly as well as parabolically. I recently purchased a BMW M3 and, as a matter of driving pleasure, wanted to stretch its legs a bit in an area devoid of traffic hazards. I pointed my car&rsquo;s compass point directly west along Bell Rd and drove until I converged with 219th avenue, at which time I stopped and played with my satellite radio module. What captured my attention was a &lsquo;star&rsquo; like object that jerked from left to right (south to north, from my vantage point) instantaneously. It covered a distance 8-10 thumb widths at arm&rsquo;s length and stopped immediately. I cannot articulate the geometry of its flight for the 11 minutes I watched it, though I will say it completed this manuever a few times in addition to sinuous ascents/descents interposed by intervals of no perceptible lateral/superior/inferior movement. Another &lsquo;star&rsquo; like object appeared in the black of the sky accompanied theretofore by no flight trajectory; it simply appeared as if it just materialized into the temporal sequence. It too moved linearly quite fast stopping on a dime and remaining in a fixed position for a little while.  Moreover, I perceived splashes of light emanating from this second light to an area both above and below it. These splashes were dimmer in luminosity than the object, by comparison. Then it traced circuitous patterns in a small area of the sky gradually departing behind White Tank Mountain, as did the third object (It is called a mountain but is really a large hill). I do not know if there are military bases in that direction. Luke Air Force Base is near but in the opposite direction. Yet, even if these objects were borne of man, how could they move in the fashion I observed?

Finally there were about 20 of them.  I tried to count them but it was difficult because of their pattern.  They make right hand turns or even reverse themselves without slowing down.  Sometimes they would suddenly be ahead of where they were going.  Wasn&apos;t sure they just appeared there or moved so fast I couldn&apos;t see it - kind of like the snap of a rubber band.They kept coming closer and after a few minutes started to move away.  One kind of hung back, and as the others faded away, it shot to the north west at an incredible speed.  This may sound strange, but it left a hole in the atmosphere.

There was an airplane in the sky and the two crafts were moving about 10 times faster than the airplane, and were at a comparable altitude to the moving plane.  It was clearly a two craft formation as the crafts moved independently, but in the same way, so they were clearly flying in formation and rather close to each other.

I thought that&rsquo;s weird, it looks like the North Star in brightness, but I was facing due south.  I then noticed a sort of tail so to say pointing down.  It almost looked like the Star of Bethlehem, however flipped upside down.  As I sat and watched this thing, I thought is this an airplane?

At one point it appeared that there were also Y attachments to the top that were green, but I only saw those on two short occasions, so I can&rsquo;t say if that&rsquo;s really what I saw or the brightness changing as it moved.As I sat and watched this object, it hovered about moving from the east to the west not fast, but just enough to where you could see it moving.  When I took a step back because I was alarmed, it sort of moved with me.  Not fast, but you could tell that it moved.  I took another step back, and it moved again.  It almost made me feel like it was watching me.  At this time I was beginning to get a little freaked out.  Ran in the house, made my husband wake up from bed to come and look at this object.  He did come, and he did see it, but he disregarded and went back to bed.I continued to watch the object for 40-45 minutes.  Again, the feeling of it watching me made me uneasy.

We lost sight of it as we drove into town, so we planned to look at it with telescope when we got home.  When we got home an hour later it was gone.  But we did notice another one  by the moon(at about 10 oclock position) and we did look at it through the scope.  What we saw was a sort of transparent looking sphere with strange circles in it and to the left of the sphere at 8 o&apos;clock was a much smaller light and to its right were three smaller lights in perfect alignment to 2 o&apos;clock.

At one point I was examining the sky at about 2 or three inches at a time.  I was looking towards the northwest and I saw a blue light with no aviation lights flew from nw towards the southeast.  I thought it was strange but when on with my observing.  About 1 minute later I saw 2 more identical lights and then more and more.  I saw at least 6 to 8 identical lights crossing the sky.  These binoculars are powerful enough to see galaxies and other messier objects.  At first I thought these lights could be sattelites but the research I have done says there are only about 14 sattelites that can be observed from earth and they are only visable for a few seconds at a time as they tumble in and out of the sun&apos;s rays.

I watched it until my house blocked the view.We are in the Shenandoah Valley which is the path of flights out of Dulles and National Airport in Washington DC.  Every evening there are dozens of commercial aircraft that fly over my house.  I can hear a jet right now.  The light that I saw did not come from the eastern sky over the mountains.  It just appeared, faded and flew south.I would say that the initial light was similar to that of a helicopter spotlight.  This light appeared to be at least 30,000 feet in the sky, not low like a helicopter.  There was no sound except the sound of the commercial airliners coming across the mountains.The light did not resemble a meteor at all.

It left an orange fiery trail. It appeared to be slightly larger than the moon and was extremely bright. It gave the appearance of burning up - almost like a plane crashing or something. Far too bright and large to be a meteor or a piece of space junk - especially with all the light pollution from the town. It appeared to be extremely close, 15 miles at the most, and very low altitude.My first thought was that it was actually a jet aircraft crashing.. the igniting fuel could explain the color... but there were no reports of anything of the sort.I thought about the possibility of a flare or fireworks... but the altitude seemed too high for that, plus there was no explosion, and the light appeared suddenly in the sky and continued on a steady trajectory heading diagonally downwards at what appeared to be free-fall speed - I don&apos;t know of any pyrotechnics that can behave like that.Since it looked as though something had crashed and it was extremely nearby, we drove up to the reservoir in the foothills just west of town and looked around.

First I thought it must be Jupiter or Venus, but then I saw that it was drifting slowly northward. A big, bright light moving to the north: this could not have been a planet or a bright star.  Some might suggest that I saw an airplane; I can only say that all of the airplanes I&rsquo;ve seen flying at night typically have flickering lights spaced apart from one another on each wing, whereas the object last night was one solid, extremely luminous ball of light.  Others might suggest that it was a satellite, but all of the satellites I have seen in my life have not been nearly so luminous as this object.  Most importantly, neither hypothesis can explain the sudden disappearance of the object. I have been curious about UFOs all of my life, but this was only the second time I&rsquo;ve ever seen anything anomalous (the first time was insignificant: probably just a balloon).  For a while I stared out my window, hoping it would come back again.  But (alas!) it was gone. I only saw it for about 10 seconds before it vanished.  Perhaps someone else in the Portland area saw it, too. I want to go to McMinnville this weekend to hear you speak, but I don&rsquo;t have any way to get there.

The disk appears to be approximately 5 feet in diameter, and has the shape of a classic 1950&rsquo;s style flying saucer.   The upper portion of the craft is outlined with a row of very bright and highly visible (white) LED lights. The disk appears to be powered by some form of electrically generated propulsion system, as it emits a steady and distinct &ldquo;humming &ldquo; sound as it passes overhead. The disk is able to ascend and descend vertically with startling speed, and is very agile and maneuverable in flight, performing banks and maneuvers not associated with conventional craft. For these reasons (and of course, due to the small size of the object) it is clear that the disk is unoccupied, operating under the remote control of an individual, or individuals located nearby. It is quite shocking and disturbing to witness this object in flight.  It resembles neither aircraft nor helicopter in appearance or operation, and clearly demonstrates its superiority to both in terms of maneuverability and its prowess in rapid acceleration and deceleration.  One is not accustomed to seeing such an unusual object passing above what is otherwise a typical California beach town. I most recently witnessed the object hovering in the sky just west of Newport Center (an outdoor shopping plaza flanked by a ring of office parks) on the 10th of May at approximately 9:30 in the evening.  I grabbed my Mini DV video camera from the house and drove over to a neighborhood park to get some footage of the object before it left the area. I shot several minutes of the object in flight, and then watched it land on an expanse of grass adjacent to the Newport Center signage pylons.   Soon after the craft landed, its lights were powered down and its operator (presumably) retrieved it in the dark.  I quickly left my discreet vantage point in the nearby park, returned home, and began viewing the footage &ndash; highlights of which I am forwarding to your organization via email. I think you will find the resulting video to be very interesting, as the camera&rsquo;s 40x zoom lens allowed me to zoom in close on the disk at times, and also to pull back far enough to include recognizable objects such as buildings, traffic lights, and the signage pylons in the frame.", "CYLINDER TYPE WITH A OFF CENTER NODE THAT PULSED A BRITE WHITE LIGHT.CYLINDER TYPE WITH A OFF CENTER NODE THAT PULSED A BRITE WHITE LIGHT , OBJECT DROPPED DOWN THEN VANISHED .

The next night the same blueish formation was seen again, however this sighting was slightly farther away from the original spot.

In an effort to take a picture, I let the flash on my camera go off, which in turn, seemed to cause a reaction to the formation, because the formation lit up at least ten times brighter than before.  Over the next five minutes, I also noticed that the original blue formation was visible, but both formations were still very far from one another.  As I was looking at the new formation, I noticed a commercial airplane flying towards the formation, and the airplane was going to fly over the formation.  As soon as the airplane was about to fly over the formation, the lights on the formation dimmed drastically, and seemed to disappear in the night sky.  The most interesting part was that after the plane was out of sight, the formation lit up again, and stayed lit.

I stood at the fence lining the yard and just stared at it.  It was so bright that when I closed my eyes there was a sun-spot in my vision(like when you stare at the sun). It was rather difficult to focus on for too long and I started to think this may not be a star or planet.  I went into the house and asked my wife to come and look at it.She agreed that it was weird and that it was extremely bright and both of us had a hard time telling if it was moving.

We heard nothing. Our friend, who was in the back seat said &quot;there it is&quot; and pointed above the trees that bordered the pasture about 100 yards off the side of the road. Above the trees,at about 100 ft. from the ground an elongated black triangle with a light at each corner floated noiselessly.One light was green, one red,and one was yellow. The red light was shining down into the trees and moved as if looking for something below. We observed this for about 2 minutes and decided that we did not want to be whatever it was looking for so we left. This was a clear, star filled sky. The aspect of this event that puzzled us as we discussed it on the way home was the speed of the object&apos;s descent and how it came to such an abrupt stop in mid-air. We dropped our friend at his residence and went to ours. My wife and I were pretty spooked and got no sleep that night.

However, we post it, nevertheless.  Date is approximate.  PD))Bright light shining with 4 lizard-like beings approaching.Late at night in the mid-summer month of July I was awakened by a very intense bright light shining from the back side of the house that I grew up in.  I was accustumed to seeing bright head lights from the railroad trains as they approached my dads property from the town of Grand Blanc.  But, this time there was no deisel engines roaring and the light never faded as would when the trains passed by the property.  I could see this really bright light coming from the other side of the house and in order to really see it I had to go down stairs and look out the back porch door.  When I did this I was so blinded by this light that I had to cover my eyes and that is when I saw them.  A small group of four short, very stout, Dark-skinned, weird looking....almost a dark purple or navy blue color Lizard-like beings. It felt like a circus or carnival coming right at me,no! Coming for me! I freaked and went inside in a sort of strange dream-like panic and desperately needed to hide somewhere. I could not think and quickly just layed down on one of our families picnic benches that we used for feeding the large number of siblings that I grew up with. I tried to imagine that I was invisible and turned myself into a bench, for I was only 9 years old at the time. They came inside and as a group picked me up and carried me away. I was paralyzed by some kind of hand held instrument and it all just seemed like some sort of carnival-like dream. When I regained what I thought was my consciousness there I was laying on that bench still. It was just starting to turn a tad bit light outside and I went back upstairs and went back to sleep. Later that summer I started having night scares and an intense fear of sleeping in my own bedroom. I did everything I could to spend the rest of the summer at my nephews home; we were close in age and I simply had no recollection of this experience, until I was a teenager and started having this exact re-occuring dream. For the longest time that is what I considered it to be, just! a reall y strange dream. Until I saw the movie,&quot;communion&quot;! The creatures were just like the ones they described visually in that flick! And then many years later my sister told me she saw them carry me out the door. We both have had to deal with this peculiar sense of being abducted and violated through some vague sense that we suffered through some ordeal. I believe that they zap you with this instrument to prevent  terror shock from killing us! Realizing this has in no way made my life any easier. It has been a burden on my psyche and self will. There are/were peculiar psycological and behavioral problems that I feel have stemmed from this occurence/disturbance in my childhood. I would sleep under my bed, seizures from out of no-where. Doctors probed my brain to see if I had epilepsy. An asthmatic condition would strike if I was suddenly spooked or surprised. To this day I still struggle with what happened.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  One of two dramatic sighting reports from the same source.

It was my (Jeff Challender) 54th birthday.  My wife came running into the room suddenly in a high state of excitement, and told me to come outside right NOW!  Our son Max had spotted something in the sky that he was certain was a UFO!!  I put on my bathrobe, and stepped out onto the front lawn.  There, in the sky, low over the houses across the street at 10 to 15&deg; above the horizon, was a UFO all right!  There can be NO DOUBT ABOUT IT!  It&rsquo;s position varied from due west, to northwest during the time we had it in sight.  This thing, which seemed to be at least a half-kilometer distant, was literally dancing about in the air.  It was soundless, and bright blue-white. My wife rushed to get the camcorder, and once I got it started, continued to video tape this thing for almost 20 MINUTES!!  I can barely describe the excitement.  We watched this thing perform the most impossible maneuvers.  It moved behind trees, returned and went behind the trees again.  I hobbled up the street to follow it at one point, and it returned to its previous position, as if toying with me.  So I went back to my chair on our lawn, and sat down.  I &ldquo;told&rdquo; it I could not, and would not, chase it again, and that it had better stay in sight for me or I wouldn&apos;t continue to film it.  I said these things half tongue in cheek, but THE THING SEEMED TO RESPOND!  It DID come out from behind the trees, and stay there!  It continued to bob up and down, and flit from side to side.  Right after I told it to DO SOMETHING, it brightened considerably and performed something like a &ldquo;fish hook&rdquo; maneuver!  It&apos;s all so unbelievable even now!  Finally, after nearly 20 minutes in sight, it dipped &quot;behind&quot; the neighbor&apos;s garage across the street.  My wife said, &quot;Oh, don&apos;t go away!&quot;.   After a moment or two, IT CAME BACK UP!  It stunted some more, finally going back DOWN behind the same garage for the final time, which was due west of our location.  It didn&apos;t return.  It looked to us like it may have LANDED somewhere in the agricultural lands about a kilometer to our west!  We waited an additional 20 minutes or so, hoping it would come back again.  Unfortunately, it did not.  So I went into the house and played the tape back on our TV.  The tape came out sensationally!  I did not zoom on the object but a couple brief times.  I held the camera quite steadily by propping my elbow on the armrest of the lawn chair, and kept the houses across the street in the field of view almost the entire time.  The film is incredible.  We couldn&apos;t sleep until well after midnight.  Must have watched the tape a half-dozen times last night. Can&apos;t wait to get into the full analysis, with enlargements and speed manipulation.  In the end, I&apos;ll have a 30 to 45 minute production detailing the entire event on DVD. Max saw the object first.  He says it was here Wednesday night, after Janet and I had gone to bed.  He tells us it was dancing around out there for at least an hour.  AND that it hovered directly over our house for a time.  We have no reason to disbelieve Max.  He told me about this sighting on Thursday morning before he went to school. So this thing was here twice in three days.  Who knows, it may have been out there Thursday night as well.

We were very startled and I inadvertently drove off the road and stopped the car, yelling &quot;WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT!&quot; over and over. I reached under my coat and took a hold of my 1911 pistol instinctively and then thought, &ldquo;Yeah right&rdquo;. As for the object itself, it was very large and oval shaped and simply glowed green and was very low to the ground making no sound and moved at a high rate of speed disappearing over the hills to the south. And for the rest of the evening we were both perplexed by what we could not explain and which scared the hell out of us. I reported it to the US Air Force whom I believe thought that I was making it all up.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We was backing out of a field near a wooded area as I looked out my opened window towards the back of the truck I saw 6 lights in a row in this clouded area near us.  The lights were compared to a car head light but was a yellow-gold color.  They did not move, they were just there for maybe 5 to 6 sec then they faded away from left to right one at a time.  As we backed onto the road I would not take my eyes off of the very spot that I saw them. I saw a very dim outline of a rectangle with the same lights but very dim to the eye. I just saw that for a few sec and it just faded away.  I was relieved to hear my husband say that he saw the lights too.", "Two fast moving brights spheres moving together over wooded lake area  Two bright, round lights seen over wooded lake area.  They were flashing red/orange and yellow moving at great velocity while turning at sharp angles.  Both objects moved together at the exact same time and direction for 15 min then dissappeared and came back 5 min later.  In the distance other people stopped in their cars to look as well I just dont know who they are.

So I can&apos;t say it was a ship, its beyond any concept of a ship. As I sat on Mt Shasta at the highest parking lot around midnight, I was with another man who was star gazing when I arrived.  We both looked up at the peak of the mountain, and suddenly, within a split second, a circle of light came on and off, what appeared to be perhaps 1000ft above the peak, in that split second, it totally lit up the entire face of the mountain, no shadows, and went off just as quickly.  What was strange, I remember that when it went off, &quot;it went within itself&quot;, swallowed itself?  I know it sounds strange, but I&apos;ve not told anyone but my wife.  All I know about the man up there that night was that he was from Reno NV. I noted his name somewhere, I could find it if neccesary.", "star like object with bizaar flight path appearing to stair step across sky at a rapid rateMay 12, 2007.First of all, I want to preface this statement by saying that I have lived near major cities where airports have been located or by Military bases all of my life and have never seen anything like this before. I will try to articulate what I saw but honestly, I don&rsquo;t know if I can find the right words to describe exactly what I witnessed. This sighting happened south of Hernando, MS around 23:22 and the object moved in a northern direction across the sky, slightly west of Hernando towards the eastern Tunica, MS area, then very likely on to west of West Memphis, then to the southern part of Arkansas. This was a light, bright as a star but it did have a strange rhythmic flash that corresponded with its bazaar flight path. This object was moving so fast that I lost sight of it after about 3 seconds. It was very high in the sky and seemed to rapidly drop altitude multiple times before disappearing in a lateral direction. The light would stay on then, as it would disappear. The next thing I would see was the light again at a different altitude and in a different place in the sky&hellip;a flight path incompatible with any aircraft. It was like the object was stair stepping across the sky and on the downward movements, the light would disappear. While moving laterally, the light would disappear again and then come back on&hellip;only to reappear in a position that would totally exclude any aircraft movement. I can&rsquo;t articulate how fast this thing was going!  What I saw tonight was neither an aircraft nor a meteorite. This was not space junk falling from the sky. I am not sure of what it was exactly, but I do know that it moved rapidly and in a fashion that was deliberate. This object was so fast that I can see how it would be missed on radar. I can only say that I got the feeling that whatever this was, it did not want to be spotted or observed.", "White dot motionless in sky begins to move- sheds into two white dotsThe sky was blue and practically clear- except some stratus clouds.  A white dot is stationed motionless in the sky.  Two planes pass right under it, showing that this dot lies somewhere higher in the stratosphere.  These &quot;stratus&quot; clouds pass over it, which dims the object, so it&apos;s obviously higher then these clouds. As the sky clears and the sun shines you can see this white dot much clearer.  After about 20 minutes it, the white dot starts to move across the sky at a steady pace, as it moves a fair distance it appears to shed another white dot.  So now there are 2 white dots traveling across the sky, and they end up traveling out of my range of vision.  This is the third time I have seen these shapes.  All three in different parts of the country.  Can never explain nor figure out what type of UFO this could be.", "Sighting over Selma OregonThe weather was bad. I went outside to check the level of the creek that ran right next to our deck.  It was a very dark night with the stars very visible.  I looked up and I saw a very large triangle shaped moving black void in the sky heading south east along hwy 199. I called my wife out and she saw it also. I was about a mile north of the Selma post office along 199. The object made no noise but just moved kind of slowly, almost hovering to the southeast. Haven&apos;t a clue as to what this was, unless it was a stealth bomber or something.  It had three points of light. one at the tip, and two to the sides and rear.  This is how I could tell its shape.", "This sighting was sparked by the question,&quot;Why do dogs howl at the moon?&quot;  The answer, I said in my head was because they are communicating/responding to something on the moon.  When I turned to the sky to ponder, I saw a bright orange light move up and down quite easily and knew immediately it was a craft of some sort.  I turned to tell my friends to look at it, turned back and of course it was gone.  Ten minutes past and I looked up again and saw the same orange light hovering in the sky.  This time as I turned to tell my friends to look up into the sky the light in the sky dimmed as you would dim a living room light, and when I told them to look of course it was too late again for them to see.  It makes me believe that some sort of mental connection must be there to view or notice these ufos.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was looking in the general direction of Oromocto from there.   Just above the tree line I saw what at first glance I thought was just another plane.  The longer I looked at it the more I realized that it was not a plane.  The colored flashing of the lights were completely random.  They had no pattern to them like a normal plane.  The next thing I noticed was that it was barely moving.  During the 10 minutes that it was visable it only moved slightly from my right to left.  Then disappeared.I called CFB Gagetown in the morning to see if they were doing any exercises or could explain the lights and they said there were no exercises and they had no planes or helicopters out.", "Saw an unidentified craft with outstanding maneuverablility and silent operation on the coast of Cancun, Mexico.I was vacationing in Cancun with my family.  My daughters and I were at the pool at night.  They were swimming, I was standing at the edge of the pool.  It was a mostly clear night with some light scattered clouds.  I heard the noise of a small plane.  I looked up and could see the plane by its lights and some reflection of the resort lights as it headed off in a ESE direction out over the ocean.  It was flying at about cloud level.  It was not traveling at a great rate of speed.Something caught my eye that at first I thought was a meteorite.  It came from over my head/shoulder traveling in a northern direction (along the coast).  It made no sound.  It moved at a very fast speed, then slowed down almost instantly.  It made a sharp move in about a 45 degree angle toward the NW then made a circular move behind one of the clouds and ended up coming almost directly back at me.  It had a single, white light in front.  The whole thing was sort of manta ray shaped and had a silvery white glow (very subtle- which was just a bit more than what would have reflected up from the resort).  It came a short distance toward me then very quickly turned completely around (a 180 degree turn in almost no turning radius) and sped away through the cloud again.  It moved very differently than anything I&apos;ve ever seen.  It was smallish, like the size of the single engine plane.  It was very organically shaped, smooth.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "((NUFORC Note:  Report from student.  We cannot be certain that this is intended as a serious report.  PD))I saw several flying lights heading from north to southIt was around 22:00 hrs on May 1, 2007, I saw through the window of a bedroom on the second floor of my house an intense light in the air at a half-mile distance. The light was so intense by far several times the light of any star. The object was also a short distance from the surface of the ground. The light went up straight vertically, diminished its intensity and moved to the left from north to south and disappeared. Since the local fire station is located in that direction and about the same distance I thought that the object might be a helicopter, however I was curious and decided to investigate some more. Immediately I grabbed my car and went to the fire station to see what was going on. My sister was with me in my car. When we reached the fire station, one of the garage doors was open and the truck was in there and nobody around. We passed the fire station when I saw the light again, this time farther out to the right of the road heading from north to south.  I decided to drive in its direction to get closer and make sure it was a helicopter. The light disappeared when I entered one of the streets on the right. We went out of those streets and went back to the road heading east for about two minutes when we saw the light again this time it was to our left like a half mile away and in the air. I don&rsquo;t think it was the same object since the previous one we saw disappeared to the right of the road and this last one appeared on the left of the road heading from north to south. The flying object crossed in front of us from the left to the right of the road and dissappeared going from north to south. We tried to follow it, making a right in an intersection where was about to the point the object disappeared but we couldn&rsquo;t see it. Then, we started to head back home going from south to north for about two more minutes when I saw again another light in the air. It looked like an helicopter in the distance because of its movement. It was flying slowly from north to south relatively close to the ground, so I was sure it couldn&rsquo;t be a plane. Its light was not intense. I reached an intersection and stopped because of a red light of a traffic light, while the object was heading to from North to South while I was facing South to North. The object was coming to my direction in the air. At that moment I remembered I had binoculars in the glove compartment of my car and I grabbed them and give them to my sister, it turns out that! she did n&rsquo;t know how to use them. Since the car was stopped she pulled down the window and took her head out and looked up and saw the lights of the object and introduced her head back into the car. I immediately took the binoculars out of her and pulled down the window of my side and took my head out of the car completely and used the binoculars to see the object. At that moment the object was right on my head a short distance from the ground, probably a four or five-block distance from the ground. I looked at the object using the binoculars and saw the chasis of a spaceship, the shape was triangular and flat. It had lights on the base, but those lights were not intense at all, but they shined enough to light the base of the chasis and I could saw the frame of the spaceship clearly,  not only the frame but all the flat metal part of the space ship which was lighted by the round light sources on the chasis. Those lights were no intense at all. They were just lighted spots one next to the other one covering almost the total area of the triangular chasis. I had never seen anything like that before in my whole life.  Since I was stopped by the red light I did all these things very quickly and only could see the bottom part or chasis of the flying object for a quick second. But because it was flying slowly close to the ground and I was using binoculars I could see it clearly. Also I realized that it did not make any sound. It was just flying slowly and quietly.When the traffic light changed to green I decided to follow the flying object to see it again, but U-turns were forbidden at that intersection and I had to turn to the left. While driving in the new road I stopped in the middle part of the road between the lanes and made a U turn and in the same interception where I saw the object I made a right turn to head in the same direction the flying object was flying but I could not see it anymore. Then we returned home. I particularly do not think these lights belonged to the same flying object, since all of them were moving from north to  south, I actually see in total four flying lights heading each time from north to south, but only in the last one I could see it using my binoculars and determine that it was not a helicopter or any plane.", "Two backward slanted cylinders flying in a &quot;momma duck&quot; formation.  One huge, one smaller (still large in size) in broad daylightWent outside while talking on the phone.  Sky was clear blue with no clouds.  Clear visability.  Very windy day with wind gusts up to 26mile with a WNW18 wind.  As I was talking, I was looking up at some buzzards gliding in the wind....I saw two objects that looked like clylinders that were tipped at a diagonal...with the slant going left to right...like this:   &#x5C; &#x5C; The top cylinder was twice as large as the bottom one. Both were slanted the same way and heading INTO the west winds....I was trying to figure out what the heck these things could be.  They were both stark white and pretty big as they seemed to be pretty far up in the Northern sky.  We get alot of Cleveland and Elyria air traffic, and this was definitely not anything I have ever seen.  They were gliding or flying smoothly and kept the same space distance between them.  The smaller object was below and slightly behind the larger one....and as they flew they kept a precise distance between them.  Definitely two separate objects. No overhead noise and no chemtrails....but as I was watching them, an aircraft flying east and higher than these objects came by...this jet/aircraft made noise and had a chemtrail, just as this aircraft was about over or on top of these objects they just disappeared....or blinked out...right in the blue, blue skies!!!  The larger one must have been really huge because the smaller one was big, and they both just &quot;stood out&quot; in the blue skies because they were so big and stark white.  I am perplexed.  As I said they flew against the wind at a steady pace.....faster than normal air traffic and with no noise, no trail...and vanished before the jet was going to fly on top of them....They were very smooth in flight.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was far off, so I went and got my feild glasses, It was moving father away from where I was standing. It was the only thing in the sky Blinking. It was not an airplane.  Looking through my feild glasses I could see it changing colors. Since it was the only thing blinking I thought that was strange.

Then I noticed that it was flashing red light.  I knew that it was not a satellite.  I thought that perhaps it might be a jet, but have never seen one up so high, but the movement of the craft was somewhat erratic and very fast.  It then made a sudden sharp turn and proceeded directly south.  I have never seen aircraft do that. It would slow down a few time and appeared to almost move around some stars. As it was moving south I glanced back to where I originally saw it and seen 3 more craft.  They were not flashing red light.  They were white light and they moved much slower than the first.  They also made the south turn and were flying in almost a triangular pattern.  They stopped and circled what I believe to be a satellite before moving on southern direction.  That is bout all I can tell you.  Thought it might be worth mentioning. Similar craft was seen last summer, but not reported as well as what I believe to be a fireball.", "Low-flying triangular craft during snow stormI was taking out the garbage at night during a pretty heavy snow storm.  The dumpster is in a well-lit parking lot.  We lived in a building complex consisting of several houses in the middle of nowhere nestled alongside a large mountain-chain.As I&apos;m returning back to my house, I catch a glimpse of a light to my right out of the corner of my eye.  I turn and I see a large triangular craft hover slowly overhead.  It was clearly visible in the flood-lights in the parking lot, though no detail could be seen through the snow.  It was no more than 20 feet above the tree line, and moved no more than 15MPH.After it passed overhead and started to head off into the darkness, I was able to gauge its height above the tree line.  I was also able to see a slight profile of the craft.  It seemed to be triangular in shape - more like a stretched out pyramid.  It could have been boomerang shape, I&apos;m not entirely sure because of the snow, but I was able to see blue-white lights on its edges/corners shaped in a triangle fashion.The craft made no sound whatsoever.One thing I noticed is that my ears popped during the encounter.  That could have just been a coincidence as it is common at that elevation.My opinion is that the snow storm was too bad for any known aircraft to be flying that low.After this incident, I seem to be experiencing a phenomenon called &quot;street-light interference&quot;.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They were luminous, but not hugely bright.  They appeared to be transparent or had a certain hard-to-describe transparent quality about them.  As they banked, they increased in speed and, still in a V-formation, they zoomed out of sight in a just a few seconds. The sighting lasted for 20 to 30 seconds max.

It was silent, hovering in the sky just over the street, quite large - like a football field - but without any discernible structure.  It was simply a collection of lights or small glowing orbs.  This was very evident when the thing began slowly moving east, towards the East River, and was silhouetted against the full moon - still, there seemed to be nothing connecting the lights, no body, yet they did appear to be part of a large object.The things then disappeared behind a building on the east side of Manhattan.I will never forget it, and I wonder if anyone ever filed a report because many people saw it.

There were 20 plus blinkers, all seeming far away, except for one that hung very low in the sky and did not blink, but when a picture was taken with a digital camera, it seemed to be moving in an erratic pattern.  To the naked eye, it just looked like a huge white star, just above the treeline.  It&apos;s brightness made it suspect, so that is when we got out the camera.The blinkers flashed blue and white and there were some that flashed with a bit of red.  We noticed several other aircraft (small planes and helicopters) constantly intercepting their path.  The blinkers did not move when confronted.  The blinkers did move somewhat, but almost like they were in their own little orbit.  Several zoomed in pictures of the blinkers appeared to be a circular craft with 6 lights and one in the center. Each consecutive picture of one blinker showed a different light on the craft lit up, as if rotating lights.  I am interested to see what happens next, over the past month, there have been more and more blinkers present, and last night was really unbelievable.((NUFORC Note:  Stars??

Kennedy [CV-67] during the late spring, early summer of &apos;77 while on the flight deck checking on our aircraft I saw what I initially thought was a meteor coming down at approximately a 45 degree angle.  The sky was clear with no moon and no clouds, there was no glow from the coastline of Florida and the ship was operating with red lights only above deck. I called my crew away from the aircraft to look at this thing, which continued down on it&apos;s initial trajectory off of our starboard quarter.  The object was very high, about the size of a cigarette ember held at arm&apos;s length.As it got lower, we could plainly see that the front was white, the middle orange, and the tail a flickering red.  Then a contrail became visible, which we took to indicate it was in the atmosphere.After 5 or so minutes a fog bank formed in that part of the sky with this object behind it, resembling a streetlight as seen through a heavy fog.  At this point, a laser-thin beam of light blue suddenly appeared, aiming back up the way this object came from. After 2 more minutes, everything started fading away, the glow diminished, the beam of light faded and the fog dissipated to where stars could be seen again in that portion of the sky. Then, at an angle approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, a dull silver colored object about 3 times the size of the largest star dropped down out of the bottom of the fog bank, shot forward paralleling our course on the starboard side of the ship then angled back upwards and was gone in literally the blink of an eye. Looking about the deck, I noticed between 50-75 personnel standing and watching this display. Years later I encountered one of my former crewmembers who was there that night and who asked me to please tell his wife that we saw what we saw because she thought he was nuts.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

While driving through this rural countryside, Her husband (W2), saw something unusual off to the NE.  He pointed it out to W1 and they both began to observe more closely.   Observed was a strange object floating just above the pine trees on the right side of the road, barely moving.  W1 driving, slowed down to a crawl to time the object&apos;s road crossover to be just above them.  The object then came to a complete stop and hovered.  Due to curvy road conditions and driver safety, W1 moved slightly down to a dirt road.  W1 then turned the vehicle around and proceeded back.  As they now viewed the object on the left side, it began to reverse it&apos;s course (BACK-UP), returning in the same direction as it&apos;s initial approach.  W1 got to a nearby area to pull off and they watched as it slowly flew back to the NE, without turning around as any normal craft would have done (BACKING-UP).Witnesses watched until the object began to vanish in the distance, then took a route on some country roads where the terrain would allow an unobstructed view and make following the object easier.  The object had by this time vanished completely.  Further searching proved futile.W1 described the object as being DISC-LIKE, but having similar profile and a large mass sort of like a military Chinook helicopter (but larger) which is what they first considered upon seeing it.  However upon close scrutiny, there were no rotors, no sound, no wings, no windscreen, no landing gear, and no markings.  The fuselage appeared like DULL or tarnished steel, with a YELLOW-GREEN tint.Local authorities in the area have no information regarding similar events and likewise the regional airport.This writer, and John Bodin, ASD for south Georgia, and MUFON researcher Joye Pugh, will continue probing this matter.  Currently, local information was found that an UNIDENTIFIED resident of the OCILLA Georgia area may have recently encountered a HUGE unknown object that he thought was going to land on his home.  Efforts to locate this witness are underway, but have thus far been unsuccessful.  This may be an important witness since OCILLA is only about 20 miles to the WNW of Douglas i.e. the scene of the above described event.NOTE TO SOUTH GEORGIA RESIDENTS---If you have any information regarding the above described event, please contact Tom Sheets, MUFON&apos;s Georgia Director, at mufonofga1@yahoo.com.    Anyone having EXPERIENCED such an event first hand, please do the following; 1) File the NUFORC report form on this site; 2) Also go to www.mufon.com and file a report there; 3)  As indicated, please contact me at the above email address.Your information is important to MUFON and to NUFORC.

They were working in an orchard above Okanogan, WA on a sunny, cloudless day around the end of July in 1991 and had just stopped for lunch when they observed a silver object hovering silently in the sky above the hills that border Okanogan city to the east.The witness states the silver object shined brightly in reflected sunlight and appeared to be hovering at a height of between a half a mile and a mile above the ground at a distance of about a mile or so from them.  At that distance, it appeared about a half an inch in diameter to the observers.  He says that the object seemed to shimmer in the sun like a mirage in the desert and that it was spinning on an axis like a coin one might spin on a table top. Because of this movement, it was difficult to tell if the outline of the object was a disk or triangle. After 2-3 minutes, the object moved north and then shot straight up very quickly and disappeared from sight.END OF REPORT.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Annoyed that I had to get up and go out back (I was tired from working all day) to see what he wanted I was stunned when I approached him and he was pointing at a brite white object in the sky. He explained to me he had spotted the object and was watching it and noticed there were no flashing lights like a plane or helicoptor have on the outside, and the object seemed to be perfectly round in shape and all white (like a perfectly round ball of light). It was flying at a really high altitude, but still very visable. My husband does not believe in aliens and he thinks UFO&apos;s are probally just new top secret aircraft by the government.  However when 2 fighter jets scrambled and began after the object he called me out to see. I observed the white object in the clear night sky and I watched it streak across the sky in a straight path.  After the jets took off  (we live close to the airport) it went off it&apos;s then straight path and began to rapidly zig zag from one point to another. I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing, no known aircraft I know about could be moving like that. We watched the objects and the jets as long as we could, till the trees got in our way, and we then ran to the front of the house and stood in the middle of the road. By the time we got to the front we could still see the 2 fighter jets but the object they were pursuing was now gone.Background on us: I am a medical assistant for well known doctor in Fresno.

I first saw a vertical wavy smoke trail above the mountains to the Southeast of Tucson, and at the top of the trail, I saw a cigar shaped object flying upwards. The smoke dissipated, and the object leveled off and flew a straight horizontal path parallel to the mountains, and probably somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 feet. I was stopped at a red light in my car when I saw this and I was able to follow the tiny distant object for about a minute before I had to concentrate more on the road in front of me.

This was on a Sunday morning where the ruins are not overrun by too many tourists.  Most visitors were locals enjoying the free entrance, sights and beautiful beach. My oldest child and I took pictures of the ruins up and down.  We ended in the afternoon swimming at the beach and otherwise enjoyed an interesting day. Next day at the hotel I overheard several of the local workers talk about sightings of UFO&apos;s up/down the coast line near Tulum but never gave it a second thought. Upon returning to the U.S., I uploaded the pictures from the digital camera to our PC.  We started looking at the photos when I noticed a speck in the corner of one shot.  Upon maximizing it I first thought it resembled a helicopter but we all remembered how quiet and peaceful the day was and did not hear any aircraft. Upon further review the bottom of the craft seems to have some sort of glow and seems to be almost oscillating.  My oldest has been bugging me ever since to either submit this picture to a UFO site or have a professional photographer look into it.I&apos;m a bit of a skeptic but I cannot seem to explain that object or the coincidence that people saw UFO&apos;S the same day the shot was taken", "Small silver sphere motionless in blue sky.UFO sighting 4/30/07 7:00PM EDT  I was lying in my hammock in the back yard taking a brief rest. The sky was bright blue with no clouds. Directly in my line of vision was a silver ball motionless in the sky. It was either very small or very high. I figured that it was either a planet somehow visible during the day or a satellite.My main concern was in trying to identify the object, so I went into my house and got my binoculars and digital camera. I got back into the hammock and attempted to look at the object through the binoculars. Because of the hammock&rsquo;s movement and my arms moving I couldn&rsquo;t keep the object steady in the binoculars. The image was moving back and forth so fast that I couldn&rsquo;t really tell much about it except that in the binoculars it looked more cylindrical with some sort of darker areas at the ends.Getting more frustrated at not being able to see the object better, I got down on the ground and tried again to get it in the binoculars. About this time I noticed that without the binoculars I couldn&rsquo;t see it at all. I grabbed my camera, a Canon A610, and ran the lens out to maximum zoom including the 4X digital zoom. I took a series of 12 pictures of the area where the object had been. One of the pictures has a bright white spot that I&rsquo;m sure is the object. Another picture has a small black dot that may or may not have anything to do with the object.The whole period of time that I was able to see the object was approximately 15 to 20 minutes. It never moved during that time except to fade from view at the end.", "Large object in north to south orbitAt 3:55am on the morning of June 6 2007 I stepped outside to let the dog out.

There may have been some trailing of light or this may have just been ghosting.I have never seen anything like this and am curious about what it was.

I noticed a formation of 4 or 5 bright lights in the sky to the south-west.  The lights were in what I would describe as a random pattern.  We decided to take an exit off the interstate so we could get a better look.  I ended up on a service road heading north. As I looked for a place to turn around I looked in my outside review mirror and noticed that suddenly all of the lights were in a perfect line!  We went about a mile down the service road, turned around and pulled over to the side and watched for a while.  One thing that we noticed when the lights were in a random group as well as when they were in a straight line, is that one or two would fade out, then slowly &quot;fade&quot; back into view.  It was a clear night (CAVU).  After about 10-15 minutes, they all &quot;went out&quot; in no particular order. Later, on the evening news, they were reported as flares, as high as 10,000 ft.  Which raises some questions: Why would they be dropping flares that high (flares are used to light the ground.  At 10,000 ft. they wouldn&apos;t do any good) and if they were dropped from a plane, how did they manage to drop the first group of flares in such a random manner?  Also, why would some of them fade out then reappear?", "Large circular object quickly streaked across sky heading north, lasted couple seconds then lost sight.Last night, shortly after midnight I witnessed what I can only describe as a UFO. The area I live is in the very northwest corner of Seattle. In the immediate vicinity there are many lights at play fields, schools, and all along the Highway 99 and I-5 corridors. The light pollution is intense, plus add to that the very bright street lights along most of the streets allow for very few stars to be seen, even on the clearest nights. It was mostly clear last night, with some light cloud cover. It was windy and fairly chaotic with much traffic noise. At approximately 12:15 AM an object traveling northbound in the sky caught my attention very quickly. There was no noise emitted that I could hear over the wind and traffic, but it seemed close enough that it should have given some report. Initially, I was not paying attention, but caught the movement in my peripheral. I generally pay attention to air traffic, which usually goes from the north to south (Sea-Tac), or east/north east to the south west (Renton?). This object was heading what appeared to be directly north, which usually only occurs when a Coast Guard helicopter is flying along the I-5 corridor. My first thought was it must be a shooting star.. an enormous shooting star. But the light intensity stayed exactly the same and the path it traveled appeared perfectly straight never varying or arching in the slightest. The reason I thought it was a meteor was because the velocity - it traveled very fast. My view of the east sky is limited on the south and north by large trees and houses. The clear area in which the object was visible runs a good length between the trees, I guess maybe twenty to thirty degrees of unbroken sky. It traveled almost the entire length - from when I took notice and raised my head - to the tree on the north end in a couple seconds. I attempted to follow the path beyond the tree to see if it continued but lost sight, perhaps because my contacts were so dry it forced me to blink repeatedly. The object itself was a bright light, light yellow in color. I thought it was white at first, but I think there was some yellow in it. It was a circle, maybe a bit oval in shape. I wasn&apos;t sure if it was my dry contacts, but it appeared to have left a short tail behind it, like a comet. Like previously stated, I could not hear any sounds emitted from the object. The size of the light was much larger than any airplane lights, helicopter light, or shooting star that I have ever witnessed. The entire incident lasted about 3 seconds. I saw no deviation from a straight path heading due north, maybe north and slightly east. It appeared to be descending, although that may have been it traveling away from my position. If I had to venture a guess based on size where it was flying over I would say somewhere over the north end of Lake Washington, maybe farther east.", "brilliant white, red, blue, green light hovering for 20 minutes, then droping in elevation w3/ out the light ever geting dimmerWe wre smoking on the back deck of mt girlfriend&apos;s apt, and I noticed a &quot;very bright star&quot; and mentioned it to her. She said that its a plane, and I was very doubtfull that was the case due to the brightness of the light and the elvation. The only light on a plane that is that bright is the taxi light, and the elvation was not coducive to a landing pattern. This object was not mooving as fast as a plane would if it was landing, flying towards or away from us. My reference was the fact that this object&apos;s light was equally intense through the whole sighting, the light did dissapear then returned several times while keeping the same position in the night sky. It was just hanging in the skly several hudred feet above and few miles southwest of the dane county airport. My girlfriend and I were watching the light and I&apos;d begun to think that this was just A low flying plne traveling away from us at an angle that made it appear to not move at all. I was in the navy for a while in the late 90&apos;s as an A.E. stationed in Lemoore Ca., and have seen alot of aircraft flying at night. This was like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen.

The object would also shoot multi colored beams of light out of the top of the object. The &quot;beams&quot; gave me the impression that ther was more to the object than we could see in the night.

We kept walking and it appeared to follow us as we walked.  This all tripped me out due to the fact i was a new believer in UFOs, but she wasn&apos;t intimidated by the craft. she decided to blink her flashlight at it to see what would happen. after flashing the light at it, the craft fired off blue, green, and red flares in the same pattern as the light blinked.  We continued our walk, occasionally shining the light skyward with the same results as before.  The craft would also follow the light if we moved the light around.As we headed back to the house, we shone the lights skyward again, illuminating the craft once more. Suddenly the lights died, and it was not batteries dying.  Both light had freshly charged batteries before we left the house.  As we walked back, we kept looking  back to see the craft following us.

As I was standing on my driveway, I saw some blue light aloft to the North moving back and forth, almost flittering like a moth.  I initally thought it was a police helicopter.  This is a well populated suburb community and it&apos;s not unusual to see one of those things circling around.  What I thought was unusual was that it was moving more in a quick back and forth movement instead of what is usually seen as a slow circle.  Also, I could not see a strong search light or hear an engine sound.  It appeared that the object was 1-2 miles away.  I thought this was odd so I retrieved a pair of quality 20x binoculars that I keep hanging on a coat rack inside the front door. What I saw raised the hair on the back of my neck.  These lights seemed to consist of a row of individual blue lights that first were traveling to the left.  As the object reversed direction, the object appeared to be first an ellipse and then a full circle that had maybe 24-30 individual blue lights around the perimeter.  It then traveled to the right and reversed the process again forming a circle at the end of its travel when reversing direction.  Its travel in each direction was maybe 3-5 seconds.  There were definitely no red/green port/starboard lights, only the blue perimeter lights and no strobe lights. I watched this object for 2-3 minutes and I believe it was out there longer than that since I noticed it there soon after I initially stepped outside.  It finally disappeared into the cloud cover.  I waited a few minutes to see if it would come back but it was gone.  I don&apos;t have a working video camera and probably would not have had time to get it if I had. I don&apos;t really want my name associated with this.  I&apos;m a 55 year old engineer and I&apos;ve never really believed that something like this could not be identified, but I have never seen anything like this.  I used to fly small aircraft so I have some experience with the shapes and types of various small planes.  BTW, the only thing I drank that night was a cup of tea and a glass of Metamucil so I was completely aware of what was happening.

I was on 23rd and 6th ave in new york city.  I watched it float for about ten seconds until i lost it behind a building.  There was no chemtrail activity for a week, but then today there was a ton.  And today I had my camera.  I was taking pictures pretty much all day from my apartment living room.  The first out of the ordinary thing I saw was a black plane, flying right to left, along the path of an already laid chemtrail.  This trail then became twisted like a dna strand.  I then moved and went into my bedroom and sat on the window sill with my computer.  About 5 or ten minutes later I saw a bright light hovering in the middle of the &apos;X&apos; of two trails.  I had to run to my living room to get my camera and then pointed it at the light asap.  I don&apos;t know what happened, but my camera didn&apos;t pick up the light, but it did get the plane &quot;appearing&quot; out of nothing.  I think it was &quot;cloaked&quot; because there are very faint geometric distortions, like in the predator movies.  Frame by frame the object moves very oddly.  The camera is shaky becasue i was trying to step out onto the fire escape.  Once i was out the object had already started flying to my right, so i ran inside to my living to get another angle.  I got a few seconds of it.Next sighting was the same sort of thing, but this time the light was MUCH more intense.  I say on camera that it looks like a flashlight.  I couldn&apos;t figure out if it was star or not.  It was soo bright though and it looked like it had an aura around it.  And it didn&apos;t flicker at all. My camera had trouble focusing on it and at times and it look very much like a disc shaped ufo when it lost focus. It hovered there for about 30 minutes, but it slowly drifted lower and to the right and finally behind a building so i couldnt see it anymore. I had almost decided that it was jsut a star until this same bright light emerged from behind the building and started over my head to the right. It wasnt traveling very fast and it had no blinking lights at all. in fact it was just one light. I could make out all the airplanes, and in fact one flies right by the orb light and you can clearly tell the difference. When it was going over my head it took on sort of a bird like shape but still was just a light... this one didn&apos;t turn into an airplane like the fisrt one did.I live on Orchard and Stanton streets in New York City.

I looked out the window where I was sitting on the passenger side and saw three, blue, circular lights hovering over a field.  They were off in a distance of about 1500ft., were in a triangle formation at first and then started moving in a fast, jerky motion. I shouted to my husband to look quick.  These lights separated and spread out still hovering above the field as we kept driving.  My husband slowed the car and we both watched these objects for another minute.  Not sure what I was seeing I asked my husband, who was in the National Guard at the time, if the military had new flares they might be testing.  He told me absolutely not to his knowledge. The lights remained hovering for a few more seconds and then each round light shot up into the sky at different angles and disappeared. Both of us still remember this UFO sighting very vividly and we even found out later on that other people saw these lights that same night as well.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At between around 6:45 to 7:15 in the morning I observed a metallic cigar or cylindar shaped object moving from south to north.  It was quite high up about one third the way up from the horizen looking west.  I had binoculars in my with me as I&apos;m a bird watcher.  I was able to watch it for around 30 seconds after I originally observed it with the naked eye.  I seemed to be traveling in a straight line.  No wings observed, no sound, no flashing lights.  The morning sun reflected off of it.  It looked something like a skinny blimb but was too high for a blimp and no sound.  I think it was traveling around the speed of a jet aircraft but no con trail.  Other jet aircraft were in the general area but they produced con trails.  I have never seen any object like this before and I am not a believer in UFO&apos;s.

It was very cloudy but not raining and I&rsquo;m not sure if it was windy or not. We were on hwy 62 getting ready to turn onto hwy 234 when I saw a shiny dot in the clouds just above the mountains.

My husband couldn&rsquo;t find a good spot to pull over with the load we were hauling and he still couldn&rsquo;t see it. When I was able to find it and start recording it I was leaned over from the passenger side of the truck towards my husband looking between his face and the wind wing, the window was up. It was more of an oval or a cigar shape when I was zoomed in on it and I thought that when we got home and viewed it we would be able to see wings and be able to identify it as a plane. I thought it was moving south while I was watching it but when we viewed it on the tv it seemed to be staying in the same place.

I do not recall the exact date, and it could even have been 1983?  Myself, my wife and three children were camped at Stewart State Park on Lost Creek Lake in Jackson County, Oregon, with another family, a co-worker, his wife and their four children.We had had a very full day and were all just sitting around chatting after eating dinner. I remember being very tired at the the time and feeling myself in an odd state of lethergy, when I noticed a roughly pyramidal-shaped formation of three glowing objects silently moving down the highway bordering the edge of the campground, moving over the edge of the campground itself, and moving roughly parallel to the highway.From where we were camped I could see pretty much the entire expanse of the campground area and quite a bit of the lake beyond, at its edge, and a portion of the highway and the bridge across the lake, at its far edge. At that time you could see this, but now the view has has changed considerably due to the growth of the trees that have been planted around the park, that were then basically just seedlings. Now, you cannot see across the campground very easily and depending on where you are camped, you cannot even see the lake, itself.But at that time I could see the other campsites across the park, I could see the smoke from their campfires, see people and I could even hear their voices. I could not hear exact words, but I could hear laughter and voices.I remember feeling amazed that what I could clearly see had not caused the slightest spark of interest from any of the other campsites. And, I can recall being amazed at my own strange lack of excitement. I just sat there in somewhat of a &quot;funk&quot; and calmly said: &quot;Gosh, look at that.&quot;  My youngest son, who was approx. 12 at the time, was sitting next to me, and he said to me: &quot;Yeah, gee....that&apos;s funny.&quot; Also, in a very calm voice, and showing no hint of excitement, either.A third person, the wife of my co-worker friend that we were camped with, who was sitting directly across the picnic table from myself and my, also acknowledged that she had seen it, too. But also in the same sort of matter-of-fact manner saying: &quot;oh yeah,&quot; very off-handedly, then she laughed continued chatting with the others in the party, who had seen nothing at all.After many years, I discussed with my son what I had seen and asked him what he had seen. His recollections are far less vivid than my own. He cannot recall EXACTLY what it was that he saw, only that it certainly was something out of the ordinary. He too, remarked how he felt the same, in an odd sort of lethergy and the odd feeling of calm with a complete lack of excitement.I also discussed the sighting very briefly with my friends wife, again many years after the incident. Her response was that she definitely saw something but couldn&apos;t begin to explain what it was, then laughed it off and she changed the subject, like she didn&apos;t care to discuss it. It was almost as though we were all drugged or had been zapped by something (though nothing of the sort had actually happened!).My exact recollections of the sighting are this: The three balls of light were perfectly round and had to be at least as large as an automobile in size, judging from how far off they were from our campsite. One was red, one was green, and one was white. I remember at the time saying to myself that they looked like Christmas Tree ornaments, they had that same sort of glowing quality about them.They were solid objects and you could not see through them, and they were each surrounded by a sort of a whitish colored halo....you could see through the halo itself, in a sort of out of focus fashion. The halo was surrounding each of the objects seperately, but not collectively around the formation itself. The objects couldn&apos;t have been more than say 30 or 40 feet, at the most, from each other.The were no windows or appendages on them of any kind....no markings at all, and they moved in complete silence, emitting no trail behind them.I watched them veer slightly from the highway edge of the campground and glide directly over the campground itself, and then out over the lake....going quite a distance over the lake before, in what felt like just seconds (or less), the three balls of light merged together, changed color to a very bright white, and then shot straight up into the sky, going extremely fast, and totally disappearing from sight. Again, not making the slightest sound, but leaving a very discernable white streak behind them, which just as quickly as it had formed, faded and then disappeared.Oddly, I put the entire incident out of my mind, and did not even mention it to anyone in the group for the rest of that week-end, nor did my son or my friends wife mention it at all. I did not report what I had saw to anyone and it actually took me quite some time to later come to the conclusion that what I had seen was very possibly a UFO. Whatever it was, it was not imagined. It definitely was like nothing I had ever seen before in my life (I was approx. 42 or 43 at that time).Does this sound at all like something that someone else has reported?  Now, many years later, when I tell this to others (friends and family), they all think I&apos;m pulling their leg about it, or they jokingly accuse me of being a &quot;bit swacked&quot; at that time.  It is not a joke....I did see SOMETHING, and I was not drinking at the time, either.  There was not a single drop of alcohol in either of our campsites, as my friend and co-worker was a recovery alcoholic and was, at that time, very early into his now 25+ year association with A.A., and I did not want to make him feel uncomfortable that week-end by drinking in front of him.If you feel that this report has any merit or deserves further communication, please feel free to contact me.", "July 1994 Safford, Ariz. 3A.M.

I told my girlfriend on the phone about it, but she told me that i should ignore it and it isn&apos;t any of my business, which i actually thought was a weird thing for someone to say to me. i told her &quot;it is my business, it&apos;s in my sky.&quot; as i continued to drive i kept my eye as much as i could on this white ball... it began moving as i connected to 84 west. the ball moved up, and started going the same direction i was going, it would raise then get lower, then it crossed over 84 to my left side. originally it was on my right. it then flew back to the right side of the freeway and lowered as if it were headed in the direction of grant highschool. I didn&apos;t see it for a about 15 more seconds. eventuall! y it ros e up again and flew at incredible speed towards NW portland, right near montgomerey park. by now my girlfriend was getting angry with me, and kept telling me that it wasn&apos;t my business. that&apos;s when i decided i needed to get off the phone with me. she hung up mad and angry, didn&apos;t say &quot;i love you,&quot; which always means she&apos;s mad. i don&apos;t know what upset her though. well the sphere hovered over NW portland for a while and that was the last i saw of it. i had then driven out of sight of the area and the big white light. i don&apos;t what the heck went on tonight. i don&apos;t know for a fact that these were UFOs, but whatever i saw scared the crap out of me. i was sweating buckets, but my arms still had goosebumps. I am still shaken and honestly feel a little crazy. i know that this seems unbelievable, and it is. I can&apos;t even believe what i saw, but i KNOW what i saw. I was high, drunk or taking any medication. i am a college senior and to see something like this and know that if i tell anyone they will think i&apos;m nuts, makes me feel crazy. i know it sounds crazy, but this really happened. i wish it hadn&apos;t because i can&apos;t understand it. i have no answers as to what i saw. all i know is what i saw. i am not making one part of this story up, i just wish someone else was in my car to see it. hopefully someone will report the same thing, and i won&apos;t feel so crazy. thank you for your time, and i don&apos;t know if this will help in anyway, but hopefully it does.", "May 28,2007 Springfield,Ma. around l:00 a.m. in the morningI COULD NOT SLEEP AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO GET SOMETHING TO DRINK AND I SAT AT THE KITCHEN TABLE AND WAS LOOKING OUT OF MY KITCHEN WINDOW IN THE DARK I LOOKED OUT TO THE WEST OF ME AND SAW TWO STRANGE LIGHT IN THE SKY THEY WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE AND I HAVE LOOKED OUT THAT WINDOW ALOT IN THE PAST 20 YEARS I HAVE LIVED HERE.

Not a cloud in sight and there was no sun to obstruct my view. As I was lying out doors in my back yard on my back and looking directly straight up into the clear blue sky I noticed an illuminated thin straight line that appeared directly in my site of view. It shined for a second and looked like it was glass or metallic. At my first sight of the illuminated line it was vertical. It then switched to a horizontal position in a split second and was about 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch in length against the blue sky.I watched the horizontal illuminated perfect straight line tilt up on its right side and move up and down and to the left and to the right. Then I watched it tilt up on its left side and move around the same way.It moved with such speed and accuracy I have never seen anything like this before in my life. It then leveled off to a horizontal position, hovered for a second and then took off crossing the entire south side of the sky in a split second. It had easily covered a 180 degree angle if not more.The object was always a perfect straight illuminated line and never did it bend. It broke every law of physics regarding speed and flight capability. I am very lucky, honored and privileged to have experienced something of this magnitude in my life time. It was truly something that was NOT even close to being of this world or man made.The object sighting lasted for about 5.5 to 6 seconds. If one wasn&rsquo;t looking into this exact section/area of the sky at this exact moment one would not be able to see what I saw. It was not visible to all. You really had to be focused on that exact area. The speed of the object was like taking a laser pen and pointing it against a wall and moving it rapidly around up and down to the left and to the right. It was moving that fast in the sky.This is only something one could see if they were watching a sci- fi movie. The technology we have in our armed forces and in this world today are (stone- aged) compared to what I have witnessed and I would take a polygraph test 100 times just to prove what I saw was in fact real.

This time it was more to the east. By this time we were about a mile south of Cross Timbers when on the east side of 65 highway half hidden in the clouds was the edge of an oval object with the same row of lights. It was just sitting there. The lights this time were really bright,lighting up what ever it was. We slowed down but didn&apos;t stop until we got home. It was a dark night with no stars out.

I was pointing out the Big Dipper to my girlfriend to show her how to find the North Star. I suddenly noticed a light to the East moving West into my field of vision. Thinking it was a satellite, I focused in on it and noticed it was three dim reddish lights in the shape of a triangle,with a blurry haze in the center, at a low altitude, moving at a very fast speed. There was no sound whatsoever which I found strange and quickly tried to point it out to the three others with me.

It made no sound whatsoever.  I couldn&apos;t exactly makeout the shape of the craft at first, because it appeared that the entire sky was moving. After watching in awe for a moment, i noticed that some of the &quot;stars&quot; were flashing like a dim strobelight.  A line of these lights extended down the center of the craft, and the outer edges appeared to have similar luminations but more widely spaced.  The size of the vehicle i saw is indescribable, other than that it covered the entire sky.  Even after many attempts to find pictures of a similar craft, as well as witnessing other ufo phenomenon i have yet to see anything in comparison.  I was twelve about twelve years old at the time and this event has changed my entire outlook on life, religion, history, and the future. At the age of seventeen, i joined the Marine Corps and was selected for Signals Intelligence(mos:2631) at Parris Island, SC. Years in this field revealed to me even more strange and sometimes unexplainable craft all over the world.

It took me only a second to realize that the size, shape and movement of the light was all wrong and definitely not a reflection.  I got out of bed and was astonished to see a ball of orange light, emanating a sort of fiery glow.  I cannot stress enough the image of fire in this situation.  My first thought was that it was an airplane on fire in the distance or a flare, but it wasn&rsquo;t falling and there was no smoke. Instead it moved from west to northeast in a very controlled motion.  When I determined that it was going slow enough that I would be able to alert my father and mother before it disappeared, I ran from the room.  Soon 4 of us were gathered on the front porch watching it move further away, getting smaller until it was only a pinprick of light and then gone. The weather was immaculate: clear skies and a very minimal amount of wind. The object made no sound and was visible to us for about 4-5 minutes. We debated who to call and finally decided to go to bed without doing anything.9:15 P.M.I had just reentered my room and was in front of the window, opening my curtains a little more &quot;just in case&quot; when an even bigger &quot;orb&quot; came into sight from over my neighbors roof (the same direction as the first object.)  As far as size goes, it started out a little bit bigger than an aspirin held at arms length, gradually getting smaller as it moved further away.  I yelled for my family again and 4 of us ran out onto the porch once more.  My father snapped two pictures with a 35 mm (the film of which hasn&rsquo;t been developed yet.) This object did the exact same thing as the first - slowly fade into the northeastern sky - but seemed to move a tiny bit quicker, lasting around 3-4 minutes before it disappeared from sight. Our neighbors were outside and we cried, &quot;Are you seeing this?!&quot; They said it was like nothing they&rsquo;d ever seen before. Back inside we called the National UFO Center in Davenport, WA and I spoke to a man and answered questions about what I had seen. He told me it was not a meteor and there were no scheduled missile launches in our area. 9:45 P.M.We were sitting down to write our own personal accounts when my youngest sister called out, &quot;It&rsquo;s back!&quot; My entire family, this time including my other sister (making a total of 5 of us) stood on the porch staring in disbelief at the third &quot;orb.&quot;   It behaved in an identical fashion as the first two.  Though the three did disappear in the same region of sky, they not disappear in identical places.Witness: 54 year old male   Approx. 9:05 P.M.  my daughter called me to come and look at a strange, glowing object in the sky.  I was in my bedroom upstairs and walked out of my room. There&rsquo;s a window that looks out to the N.E. I saw an orange, glowing light moving slowly in the eastern sky.  It was clear night, no clouds. It appeared to be moving slowly away, getting smaller, but the light appeared to be pulsing and becoming dimmer. Not sure if it was because of distance as it moved away or was dimming.  We watched it for another few minutes.  I called my wife to come and see it. She saw it for a minute or so before it disappeared from view.We were all excited and mystified. It did not appear to be a plane and made no sound that we could hear. We talked about reporting it but decided we felt silly. I started to go back to bed. After another couple of minutes my daughter called out that she sees another one! I bolted out of my room in disbelief and witnessed another glowing object at 9:15 in the same location. I ran downstairs to run outside for a better unobstructed view. It seemed larger and very bright orange. It almost appeared to be on fire, like shimmering rising from a slow-moving, floating orb. I could not make out any details - only orange-red glowing as it moved from west to east. My daughter came up behind me from inside and handed me her 35 mm camera. I snapped 2 photos. We then called the Nat&rsquo;l UFO Center in Davenport, WA. My daughter reported the incident to them on the phone. Amazingly, my youngest daughter, who was able to see the 2nd orb was looking into the eastern sky and and yelled out that she sees another one! We thought she was joking, but we ran to the front door anyway and witnessed a 3rd identical object traveling in the same direction. We were somewhat alarmed by it by now. My neighbor was outside standing on his driveway, talking to a friend. I called over and said, &quot;C--, do you see that? What is it?&quot; He said he had never seen anything like it. We watched it disappear in the same direction after several minutes.Witness: 13 year old female  On April 16, 2007, I saw an orange fiery ball in the sky that I thought was a UFO. It started at about 9:05 and they were about 5 minutes long in the sky. My other 4 family members saw them in the sky. When I saw the second one it scared me and it looked like a ball of fire traveling northeast in the clear night sky. That one started at about 9:15. When I spotted the third one through my living room window, it was a little smaller than a full moon. When it traveled across the sky, it went left to right and then stopped. When it stopped it started to fade away. That was about 9:45 to 9:50 or 9:55.

I happened to look in the driver&rsquo;s side mirror, at the traffic backing up behind me, and noticed something in the distance in the sky. At first I thought it was an airplane or helicopter, as the area isn&rsquo;t far from O&rsquo;Hare Airport, but I noticed that it had a sort of orangish-white glow to it, and as it very slowly horizontally moved along across the clear blue sky, I could see it had a shape that reminded me of a thimble. The size of it was from where I was sitting in my car about the size of my pinky-finger nail from about an arm and a half-length&rsquo;s away.

Sort of like the noise from War of the Worlds.", "Meteor-like object seen while watching an Iridium flare.According to Heavens Above, a very bright (-8 magnitude) flare from Iridium 49 was visible from my location. It was to be seen in the ENE at 39 degrees elecation, starting at 22:06:06. The distance of the flare center from my location was 2.7 km. The flare (a reflection of the sun) came right on time, but because my eyes were fixed on a spot a little higher up and a little further north, I missed the beginning of the flare. I did catch it in the corner of my eye and looked directly at it when it was at its brightest. The flare was quite spectacular but it faded quickly. The duration of the flare was no more than 2 to 3 seconds. Less than 2 seconds after the flare had faded from view, a bright and very fast moving light came from the north, heading south. It flew horizontally less than 5 degrees below where the flare had been. I saw the moving light first in that location and followed it until it was obscured by a tree. The entire event lasted no more than 2 seconds. The object (light) had the general appearance of a meteor but it looked like no meteor I had ever seen and I have seen my share of them. Besides, meteors do not fly parallel to the ground. The head was about the diameter of three Jupiters (or about 2 arc minutes in angular size. The front was convex and the back was concave. Two very  thin &quot;streamers&quot; came off the end points on the concave end. The color of the light was white with a yellowish tint. It remained steady in intensity over the brief duration. I estimated the angular distance between the location of the Iridium flare (and the appearance of the object) and where the tree blocked the object as about 45 degrees. The object traversed that distance in 1.5 seconds. These facts give the object an angular speed of 30 degrees per second. That it ten times faster than the Space Shuttle flying over CA for a landing in FL, and 60 times faster than the angular speed of the ISS (International Space Station) when it passes overhead. The brief duration of my observation leaves me with the impression that the object was not at a very high altitude, although I have no facts to support that impression. If the object was as low as 10 000 feet, my calculations show that it flew at a speed of 1.26 miles/second, or more than 4500 miles/hour. If it was at any higher altitude, its speed would have been proportionately faster. Then there is the element of coincidence that I find difficult to accept. How can two visually spectacular but otherwise totally unrelated events occur in the same patch of sky at essentially the same time. What are the odd??  What did I see. Can someone enlighten me?", "Update on previous report: RE: Blue/yellowish blinking light in the western sky of SW Central FloridaI live in SW Central Florida, and every night I sit on my screened in porch which faces the west. A couple weeks back, I looked up into the sky for stars, and there was a tiny blinking blue &amp; yellowish light that zipped around, up &amp; down, and side to side. The first time I saw it, I thought it was a star, but then noticed the blinking blue/yellowish light, which ruled out the star. Then, I thought maybe it was a plane or helicopter, but then realized it was too high in the sky. I then thought maybe it was a light from a transmitter tower, but, it kept moving in odd patterns with no regulated motion. It almost moved like a fly or mosquito does in flight, and appeared to be as *tiny* up in the sky. It&rsquo;s visible after dark, stays in the sky for a good length of time, maybe an hour or more, then it will slowly motivate it&rsquo;s way higher &amp; higher, zig zagging in different motions until it disappears by about 11pm - midnight. Last night (04/11/07), it was a rainy night with hazy cloud coverage, and this *object* played it&rsquo;s usual game of zip here, zip there, but, it was also zipping in &amp; out of the clouds as if it was playing hide &amp; seek. I am NOT saying it IS a UFO, as it is TOO high in the sky to really tell WHAT it is, but, it is NOT something that I can explain by logic of things I&rsquo;ve seen (I really don&rsquo;t even *believe* in UFO&rsquo;s, *as *they are referred to &rsquo;spaceships for Aliens&rsquo;). So, I was just wondering if anyone else MIGHT know WHAT it is??? Maybe something the military is doing, or perhaps a satellite. I don&rsquo;t have any other witnesses, as I live alone. And, I don&rsquo;t have a telescope that I can use to get a closer look, and I don&apos;t believe *visible* pictures would prove anything. I was just wondering if any one else has seen it, or knows WHAT it IS!((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I watched it for quite a while, it may have been up to 5 minutes.  It had two stationary lights on the front, and had a clearly defined outline.  It was probably grey/black in color.  The lights were an Amber orange color. They were not moving  The craft was not moving, and made no sound, I know this because I turned the car radio off, rolled the windows down, and slowed the car way down.  I lost sight of it after a few miles, and tried to see it from my yard with my husband, but could not", "Oval objects over San Juan skies in broad daylight.July, San Juan, Puerto Rico (mid-afternoon): 1969:  Dark Gray Ovals  I was 14 years old then, arriving on the island of Puerto Rico from Connecticut with my parents; we had a house in San Juan which we rented, and needed yearly maintenance.  I heard a lot of talk on the radio, and through local word of mouth about unusual sightings in the skies all over the island.  I often climbed roofs where on two clear nights I saw several fuzzy circles flying over the city near the airports (there are two airports in the city, one a military, the other a civilian international airport).  These objects were flying very slowly, and seemed to reflect the city lights (having no lights of their own).On another day, in our backyard,  I saw two dark gray oval objects in the distance on the flight path of our commercial airliners (our house is directly on that path).  However, these objects were slightly oval, dark gray, and made no sound.  Being aware that these might be UFO&rsquo;s I made a point to observe them carefully as they flew almost directly overhead (see diagram).  They flew slightly askew from each other, as in formation, keeping a perfectly straight course northward (towards the Atlantic).  Because I was in the yard, the house overhang soon blocked my view of them, but I climbed to the roof on a tall iron gate: I was up in less than 30 seconds, but to my bewilderment they were gone!  Thinking they had gone inside low clouds, I waited for them to reappear on the other side, but after waiting several minutes, they were gone.For years I wondered about these events, and only now I am reporting them officially. They could not have been balloons because they did not wobble, or altered their distance from each other, and, most importantly, they did not move with the prevailing wind (since they appeared to go diagonally into moving clouds). I am a serious person (I work in human services in my city); I would not deceive anyone by telling this story, and now, after many years have come to believe that the objects I saw may be extraterrestrial.  If so, we are living in a very special historical period.", "orbs in the kentucky skyMy brother and I witnessed a orb like craft traveling north with no flashing lights.It was just a bright orb.  My brother said look at that star its moving.about 30 seconds later a red orb appeared to break off the bright orb and procceded infront of the white orb then made a left turn heading west.  There were no noises of any kind.", "Sightings in Greenfield, ILJune 1, 2007  I have seen a UFO on three different occasions in the last 6 months here in Greenfield, IL. The first incident was the same day in November 2006 when the sightings were reported at O&rsquo;Hare airport in Chicago, IL, although I didn&rsquo;t realize this at the time. It was approximately 9:30 pm. I went outside to bring my dogs in for the night and saw an extremely bright yellow/orange light in the Southern sky over a corn field behind our property. We live in a rural area and there are very few lights at night, so it is very, very dark. Any light at all will stand out in our area. I had never seen a light in the sky like this before and thought for a minute that it might be a new street light that had been installed. However, it was too high in the sky to be a street light. I stared at the light for a minute or two and realized that it was moving closer to me and getting larger as it moved. I then realized that this was some sort of UFO. I actually could not tell what shape this object was, it just appeared to be the brightest light I had ever witnessed. It stopped moving and hovered approximately 200 feet in the air, maybe 100 yards from me. I had the distinct feeling that whatever this was, it knew that I was looking at it, and I felt it was looking at me. This object made no noise whatsoever. I kept listening for some sort of sound, thinking maybe it was a helicopter or something, but no sound at all. It hovered at this point for approximately 4-5 minutes then just disappeared into thin air. It did not move up, down, sideways or back. It just disappeared completely. Two days later I heard about the sightings at the Chicago airport and wondered if this could have been one of the objects that were seen there. The second sighting was in April, 2007. I saw the same bright yellow/orange light at approximately 10:00 pm. It moved from West to Northeast. Again, I could not discern any detail of this object, only that it was very similar to the light I had witnessed in November, 2006. It moved at a very high rate of speed. This time, it did not hover but just continually moved across the sky. I have no other detail for this sighting. The last sighting was approximately May 10, 2007. I was lying in bed looking out the window at 11:15 pm. I suddenly noticed the same bright, yellow/orange light in the Southern sky, again at the same spot I spotted the light in November. It hovered at approximately 100 feet or so for approximately 5 minutes. I then called my boyfriend into the room and he witnessed the same object. It hovered at the same spot for a while and we could see that the lights would dim to almost nothing, and then get bright again. From the angle I was seeing the object; it appeared to have 3 lights across the front. It appeared at this time to be round or cylinder shaped and I was seeing the front arc of the object. The object continued from bright to dim for approximately 5 minutes then began to move to the Northeast. When it reached the point that it was over the tree in our backyard, we could see that it wasn&rsquo;t round at all, but triangular in shape. It didn&rsquo;t seem to be moving all that fast and we ran to our front door and went out on the porch to watch the object continue moving to the Northeast. Up to this point, we heard nothing from this object. It made no sound at all. But, once it passed us to the Northeast we did hear a noise coming from the object. Something like the sound that comes from an airplane in the sky, however it wasn&rsquo;t that loud. It was almost a swishing sound, not a rumbling sound. It continued to blink off and on and disappeared into the Northeast sky. The entire incident lasted maybe 15 minutes. After witnessing this last object, I began to think about the first sighting I had. I wondered if the object I first encountered didn&rsquo;t actually disappear into thin air, but simply turned its lights off as the last object had. I have asked at our local gas station if anyone has ever reported seeing UFO&rsquo;s in this area. I was told that occasionally people do report sightings. I have only lived in this area less than a year and do not know anyone personally to ask about sightings.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At first the object appeared to be moving in a staight line but sudenly it reversed its direction and gained significant altitude.  From the new position it would appear to bob up and down a few times then move again at a high rate of speed toward the north-west.  The sky was bright and sunny with almost no cloud cover or haze.  The oval looked to be either white or silver.  The total time that it was in view was around two minutes.  I do not think that the oval was a airplane or a helicopter as there was no noise and the aerodynamics was beyond anything that I have ever seen.", "Light from west to east that diminished and disappeared at about a 110 degree angle.I was watching above the Olympic mountains and saw a star about a 1/4 the brightness of Venus come from west to east across the sky above our home. I thought it might have been a satellite as the speed was similar to low orbit satellites I&apos;ve seen before ( but about half again as fast). As it passed me ( about 110 degrees vertical from us) it quickly dimmed and diminished in size (i.e. rising). There was no aircraft sound and satellites I&apos;ve seen before can easily be tracked across the sky with minimal change in magintude. It was definitely different.", "4 Bright Lights, 1 triangular shape, ,hover over APS Power line, Interstate 17 at Black Canyon CityFriday, April 6th 8:00 pm to 8:30pm Interstate 17 North from Phoenix, Arizona  Traveling north on I-17 with 2 other people in the car and heavy weekend traffic, I noticed a bright light on the horizon.

I looked up in the western sky and at about 40-45 degrees (above the treetops) saw a dark object that at first looked like a boomerang and I thought was a flock of birds flying in close formation.  I could not estimate distance from us, altitude or size, but was at least as large as a quarter held out at arm&rsquo;s length. The sun was down below the tree line and the sky was mostly clear with high cirrus clouds. Right away, I noticed that the object was changing shape, almost like it was rotating or tumbling.   It looked like a dark tube or rod that was bending and reshaping itself.   I pointed it out to my wife and she observed it also.   While we were watching it move from South to North-Northwest (with the direction of the wind), our neighbors came out on their front steps and saw it also. After about 20-30 seconds it had moved out of our sight behind trees to the North West of our location.   All 4 of us stood around for a minute trying to figure out what it was and making jokes about it being the beginning of the alien invasion.  We thought it probably was a kite or a banner or something that had broken loose, since it was traveling with the strong South wind. At no time did we notice a sound from it. My wife and I then walked into our back yard and heard jets accelerating.  When we looked up in the eastern sky, we saw two F-16&rsquo;s from the Iowa Air National Guard wing at the Des Moines Airport turning to the northwest and heading in the same direction that the object was moving.  We remarked that it was odd, since the National Guard usually flies on the weekends, not on Tuesday nights.  My wife immediately remarked that they must be going after the thing, since it looked very solid and they must have spotted it on radar. I didn&apos;t  think much of the object and was willing to dismiss it as flying debris until we saw the F-16&apos;s heading in the same direction.   It may be a coincidence, but it just seemed odd that we saw the fighters right after the sighting.", "Our first UFO sighting from downtown Everett, WA area...Pretty Scarey too me!this is from my myspace blog, i have replaced our names...

It was mid September early in the evening, just before the streetlights came on. 2 of my brothers, 2 friends and myself were hanging around out side in front of my parent&apos;s home. I noticed a distinct flickering light coming just east of our subdivision, in the sky. I lived right near the Detroit city airport and was used to seeing all kinds of different aircraft. Yet here was this strange flickering light coming out of the eastern sky, catching my attention!  Intrigued, the 5 of us decided to watch the path of this strange moving &ldquo;craft&rdquo; as it continued across the sky due west. I say &ldquo;craft&rdquo; now because at this point, about 5 minutes after we first noticed it one could plainly see what I can only describe as a flying saucer! There it was plane as day just moving across the sky for all to see, a classic type flying saucer. On the out side diameter were these different colored lights, red, yellow and blue. Just moving around clockwise. Now here&apos;s where it gets really interesting, in our subdivision there was a side street that ran north and south, this is where we stood most of the time watching. The&ldquo;craft&rdquo; slowed to a full stop and hovered just above a cemetery that was 3 streets north of ours. It hovered  lower until it was about 60 feet above the ground. If you hold a silver dollar at arms length and held it up at about a 30 degree angle that&apos;s  the size it looked in the air. So it was abuot 40 feet in diameter. The 5 of us thought it was just too cool! I was shaking like a leaf. We watched this thing as it hovered there,just &ldquo;showing off&rdquo; I thought, for about 4 minutes when suddenly it decides to hover on an angle exposing the bottom side of the &ldquo;craft&rdquo;.  It was the weirdest thing, the bottom was just solid black void! If the flickering lights were shut off and the &ldquo;craft&rdquo;  hovered above you ,you wouldn&apos;t even know it was there unless it made some kind of noise. I didn&apos;t here any distinct sound coming from it from where we stood watching. The &ldquo;show-off&rdquo; decided it was time to move on so the &ldquo;craft&rdquo; straightened  horizontally (like most flying saucers I guess). It began moving straight up in the air until it was about as high as a small Sezna plane would fly. It continued it&apos;s westerly path rather slowly, again like a small plane, then suddenly the &ldquo;craft&rdquo; just shot it&apos;s self like at warp speed westward and was gone out of sight. &ldquo;Wow!!&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;I always wanted to see a UFO!&rdquo;  A few moments later there were 3 police choppers hovering above the cemetery were the &ldquo;craft&rdquo; was.I never herd or read anything about the incident from the news, &ldquo;Hush-Hush&rdquo; I guess.If anyone else has seen this sighting, I shure would like to know!((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I recall leaving from celebrating my Aunt&apos;s 50th birthday party weekend at the time. She had a condo in Toronto and a cottege in Beaverton, so recalling my 7 year old memory is slightly dusty which is why I don&apos;t recall where we were coming from (nor does my family).My sister and I were in the back seat of the family car and we had our heads up in the rearview window (right. no seat belt requirement then) as we often did. We noticed a black triangle blanking out the stars and very slight amount of high, wispy cloud that evening. We thought it was strange and thought it was even more bizarre when slightly pulsating red lights came on at all three points. It traveled with us 3-5 thousand feet (?) above us and matched our speed.This only lasted for a few minutes and it took off picking up speed slowly until it was gone.When I saw the Stealth years later, it prompted me to think again of the object I saw as a child 30 years ago. As my dad worked in aviation at this AFB, I asked him these years later if the Stealth had ever been there at that time. He laughed and said no.I&apos;m curious if there is anyone else out there that had seen this in the area west to the 400, east to HW 12, South to HWY 7 or north in a line between Beaverton/ Sutton/ Barrie/ Base Bordon.Thanks!", "2 crafts seen gliding over cityMy Fiancee&apos;(32yo Manager) and I(25yo business owner) were waiting in line to pay for parking entry to an amusement park when I saw the crafts.  My Fiancee&apos; was digging through his wallet for his pass, and I was looking to the south, up at the sky.  The sky was bright blue and the only clouds to be seen were two thin, wispy clouds at a very high elevation.  It was a very bright and sunny day. As I looked at the sky, I noticed a flying craft appear directly in front of where I was viewing.  I had not noticed the craft at all in my peripheral vision. The craft seemed to be flying at about the elevation I see helicopters flying at frequently.  Maybe a little higher.  The craft had the look like it was surrounded by a haze, and it appeared to be a solid dark grey color.  It also looked like it was flat on the bottom and hill shaped on top.  I did not see any wings or propellers on the craft.  It was flying in an easterly direction, and it appeared to be going pretty slow. Slower than I&apos;ve ever seen an airplane fly.   It appeared to be gliding along.  I didn&apos;t really think much about the craft, figuring it was probably a helicopter or something, until it disappeared right in front of me.  I observed the craft for probably a couple of seconds, and then it appeared to fade and disappear completely.  It did not reappear.  I was going to say something to my fiancee&apos;, but, he was busy with the cashier, and I really didn&apos;t believe my own eyes enough to tell my fiancee&apos; that I thought I saw a ufo.  I stared at the spot where I had seen it, hoping it would reappear, when ANOTHER craft materialized where the last one had.  This one was a little higher in elevation (not much) than the previous one.  It looked identical to the previous craft and was moving at the same speed.  This time I wanted to tell my fiancee so that I could have another witness, but he was still talking to the cashier.  It glided by for a couple of seconds and then proceeded to fade and disappear at about the same spot as the previo! us craft I think from the time I saw the crafts to the time they disappeared they might have traveled 1/4 mile.  They were moving very very slow.  There wasn&apos;t anything blocking my sight anywhere around me.  I had a clear view all around me of the sky.  I continued to watch for another couple of minutes to see if they did infact reappear somewhere else, but, I did not see the crafts anytime again after that.", "2 feet long disked shape saucer , multiple sightings  It all started in the summer of 2003, one night after having a hard time to sleep because i had the flu, i heard a loud hovering noise as a bright light flashed and covered most of my room, during the flash i tried to yell however i couldnt manage to get any sound to come out...probably due to shock ...when i focused to look to my window i seen a typical disk shaped object spining only a few feet away from my window...i closed my eyes and pulled my sheets over my face ( i was only 14 at the time) the next thing i remember is waking up the next morning.  I just figured it was a dream however my curtains were still open as well as my window which i keep shut...as time went on i convinced myself it was just a dream til about a year later i heard the same hovering noise outside my window ...this happened a few times over the next few months and evertime i open my curtains to look out i heard the noise become faint and sometimes in the distance i can see i star like object quickly flying away...after this happened so many times and i was tired of my parents laughing at me i waited to hear the noise again ..when i did , rather than open my window i woke my parents up and told them to look out the window..when they did theyt seen and object flying away ..it was furhter this time but they did see it , they just assumed it had nothing to do with me..after that sighting , i never had any problems of such again and once again i question what really happened((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

She acting strangely and was just staring with the dog back inside already, so I asked her what she was doing and she said something about looking at a star, but she thought it was twinkling too brightly. I said,&quot; it&apos;s probably just Venus or something. I looked at this star for a moment which seemed to be in our N by NW sky.The bright moon was behind me and I tried to see if I could see any other stars in the sky and or if I could see what I thought were planets versus stars so that I could explain it to my mother that it was probably just nothing.When I looked behind me I saw what seemed to also be a bright star but it was moving and then slowly at first then seemed to speed up and then resume previous speed. It  moved in and out of the clouds as there was some medium cloud cover.Then I noticed that there were two objects, then I noticed there were two objects the second was behind the other but not following directly behind it but to the left and behind to the indication of about 12 inches if I put my fingers apart as an indication as I looked up in the sky. The objects looked to be of similar size and brightness to the planet Venus when it is the biggest and brightest in the sky.I thought that was strange so I decided to go around the house into the backyard to get a better look without the roof of the house obstructing my view of the sky.I was looking for navigation lights and strobe, so I was looking for green, red, or strobe of normal aircraft that fly over our skies as this is a heavy traffic area, but I saw none.Then I scanned  sky to my left to again see if I could locate any stars planets etc or anything else to compare these objects to, and I saw another object slowly moving through the sky as the others and identical, I was  looking south southeast  I could see no other stars just these objects in the sky an a very bright moon that was partially obscured by clouds.Now I was looking at three objects that were different than the one I originally witnessed that had the attention of my mother.It is hard to judge distance and altitude if you have nothing to gage by, so all I can say is if I were holding my hands up to the sky out at 45 degree angles and my armpit being a tangent line that would be going straight out then the objects were that far apart.So to better explain if I was holding my hands up in front of me the first two objects traveling west were 36 to 40 inch&apos;s in front of the solo traveling object, also moving west.So two objects were traveling west as I was looking south, south west and another also traveling west as I was looking south south east.Now here is the weird part and i have no way to explain how this happened.As I was looking s se at the third object traveling west, I turned to look back at the other two objects and they were right back in the same place they had been when I first saw them and then they started to move west again as if the entire event had been rewound on a video and that disturbed me greatly.At that time my mother had come out in the back yard.  I was asking her to watch them move and I pointed out the other object in that was traveling solo and it too was in it&apos;s original position as I first saw it,as I looked back at it  Then I went back to looking at the two traveling west together and my mother was looking at the single object which she said had stopped and then started to move again.I realized at that time this situation was indeed strange to say the least and I immediately without hesitation came to my computer which was on.I entered in the search for peter davenport UFO reporting center and had the number to call within seconds and within one minute was making the report.I was instructed to call another witness immediately and  then proceeded to follow that instruction as best I could. I called a friend that I had been visiting earlier in the evening as said go outside and look. That person witnessed three object as I did and also when she looked back at the two they appeared to be in the original position that she saw them in.So the objects were continually moving west and at varied speeds and then if you looked away for any reason and then observed them again the objects seemed to be where you first saw them, but they never appeared to stop moving,  However when I first saw the single object looking S SE at first it seemed stationary then moved slightly and then moved in a continuous manner.None of the witnesses including myself were under the influence of any type of drug or alcohol and had not partaken in any drugs or alcohol or any stimulating substances as we are all non drinkers and do not take drugs.I am a former Civil Air Patrol cadet squadron commander and held the rank of Second Lt. having served in CAP for five years. I was cadet commander of Squadron 130  Group One  based at Van Nuys Airport  Prior to that I was a Search base radio NCO, Squadron 10 Group Two in Northern California and was based at Reid Hill-view airport, in Palo Alto California  I am a trained CAP Air Search and rescue observer.I have also served on ground teams.I participated in more than 25 searchs in five years and attended flight training school. I learned how to fly at 16 years old, however I am not currently a licensed pilot.What I observed was strange indeed and the objects in the sky did not act or move like conventional aircraft.My opinion is that what was observed can only be filed as unidentified.When I returned back outside after calling the reporting center and my friend, the cloud cover was heavy and not medium and none of the sky was visible which I also thought was strange indeed, as only medium cloud cover was visible during the observations of the object.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this witness for the excellent report he submitted, and for his having done everything right, i.e. for his having attempted to have other witnesses observe the object.

The light changed from red to white but was not in a sequence similar to aircraft strobes. The closer I got to the object the larger it appeared. It was not traveling very fast so there was plenty of viewing time. I stopped at a stop sign and turned the vehicle off but did not here any engine noise from the object. The object continued east not in a straight line but in a slow oval like pattern.", "Stationary triangle banked in front of us then glided awayIt was a nice clear night on the east side of Detroit, the moon was waxing in the west.  I had just picked up my friend from his house, and as we turned a corner looking ESE we simultaneously said &quot;Whoa!&quot;.  Nearly stationary in front of us at about 1,000 feet over Lake St. Clair was a formation of lights.  There were 5 of them in a line at about a 45 degree angle, as if an airliner was banking in front of us with an array of lights on it&apos;s wings.  The center light was the brightest.  We followed the same direction and watched as the craft banked north and it&apos;s bottom faced us.  What we both saw was a triangle of yellow lights with a white flashing light at it&apos;s rear.  As it headed north, light after light went out until there were two blue lights at it&apos;s tips and then it disappeared past the trees faster than we could keep up with it.  I spend a lot of time looking at the sky.  We have a couple major airports in our area as well as a National Guard Base.  I have seen a lot of lights from all kinds of aircraft, and this was the first time I&apos;ve looked up and questioned anything I have ever seen before.  My friend was in as much surprise as myself.  It defied all logic of modern aircraft that I have witnessed.  It was as large as a 747, yet behaved like a slow helicopter with no sound.  I would love to know if anyone else in the area saw anything similar.", "pulsating UFO sighted in Arizona, USA.BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON OBSERVER:  I have been, for quite some time, extremely interested in the contents of our universe.  Of course, aliens being one of these things.  Ever since young age, these potential entities have perplexed my mind.  There were points in my life where I was almost literally addicted to the investigation of these phenomena. ACCOUNT:  I witnessed, for the first time, a UFO at approximately 4:00 AM on the date of May 24, 2007 in the city of Chandler, Arizona.  Not being able to sleep, I decided to do some stargazing in the front of my home. The object, which first appeared to resemble a star, moved at a steady rate.  The pulsating of light (which appeared to be spontaneous), was one of my determining factors that this was some form of advanced technology.  The UFO seemed to move at an almost constant rate of speed toward the southern hemisphere.  Then, in abrupt fashion, the object disappeared. Almost immediately after I lost track of the UFO, a helicopter passed by overhead.  Do these two have any correlation to each other?  I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think it is definitely worth mentioning.", "daylight sighting of a classic disc type object.Firstly I have had 3 daylight sightings in my lifetime. Firstly, I would like to relate to you the most shocking sighting.  I was working as an IT technician and was on location at Cardiff High School. I was waiting for a windows operating system installation to finish and was looking out of the library window feeling quite bored. It was quite cloudy, very overcast and the cloud cover was quite low. It was December 05 and we had had some rain earlier in the morning and through the clouds I could see a diamond type shape making its way through the could cover. I continued watching it thinking that it was a hot air baloon as it seemed to bob through the clouds like a cork would on water. As it got closer it broke through the cloud cover it was a cylider, gun metal grey in colour that was slowly rotating. When it broke through the clouds it was at a left angle. It straightened out! and leaned to the right still rotating and then went back into the clouds. It really felt like I was seeing something that I shouldn&apos;t be seeing and it was so large and onimous that it kind of freaked  me out, so much so  that I quit my job to be closer to home. I now work in Swansea at 5 grand less a year to be closer to my family incase anything should happen. It seems a bit of an extreme action but either I was badly halucinating or I actually saw something that was totally out of this world. I cannot tell you what it was but I can tell you it was no plane, baloon, venus or swap gas. My earlier UFO sighting happened to me when I was 11 years old, in the middle of the day at my local Junior school.I was always the last to be picked for football being a short fat kid and was hanging off the raillings of the school yard waiting to be picked as goalie as usual. It was a clear sunny day and visibility was really good. I heard some of the kids in the yard start saying things like they were looking at a flying saucer.I glanced up but couldn&apos;t see anything. I looked around to my left and saw to my astonishment what can only be discribed as two dinner plates joined together top to top and viewed from the side. It made no noise at all and shot across the sky from one mountain at the top of the valley behind another valley into the next.It went from the Llynfi valley (town called maesteg) into the Afan valley. It left a shadow on the ground and was below the height of the mountain which it passed behind. Literally a few seconds later there was an almightly roar as two RAF jets, Jaguars I think  chased it behind the mountain it disappeared behind. It really freaked me out. The ufo literally left the planes standing.I approached a teacher along with three other pupils and tried to explain what I had seen. I asked him why the ufo never made a sound and he told me the wind must have been blowing the other way???? Neadless to say that the incident changed my views on things for the rest of my life. If it was a government aircraft why was it being tested so low over a populated area?  Don&apos;t they have test ranges for that sort of thing?  Why did I hear the jets and not the ufo?  Why would a government risk testing prototype untested aircraft over populated areas, when there is a danger of these &quot;aircraft&quot; failing?  The object in my third sighting however was picked up by my digital camera using night shot in daylight.  Nothing was seen at the time of the shot but when checking my pictures later a disc was clearly seen.   This has been analysed by a private ufo group and the results are quite startling.  ufo websight http://www.alien-disclosure-group.moonfruit.com/ under recent posts.

I only noticed this anomaly IN the camera, as this last shot was kind of facing a very bright sun, and did not see the object when I was taking the picture.

One day I saw a tiny speck in the distance floating, like the end of a pencil so small, It was above some power lines across the street in the distance. I was curious but well, I was only four. I went inside and came back outside the next day to play. Curious I looked up to find the spot had gotten closer in the same location. no detail  just closer. I got very excited, not sure why. Maybee having something to look at starred at the thing, size of a base ball above the power lines.Next day I was so excited to see the thing , if It was there? And yes getting even  closer. I sat for hours gazing at the object. It got closer to me and I could see some detail. It was round like a little earth. Solid but translucent at the same time. It was constantly moving the outside  layers as  to reach to  change and react to the world. It was communicating but not in words. In a visual mindset. I wish i could explain. I fell in love with the object and could not get enough. It came so close to me that I could almost jump and touch it but would move just out of my reach. The next three days it started moving back further away and finally left. Two questions is how can a four year create  something he has never seen? Why  did  I have such a great connection with this object? I honestly believe that there is something beyond our understanding.", "Two friends and myself were doing salmon fishing on a river in early October, at night.  When we filled our catch, we walked out of the woods and set along the road and waited for a ride that had dropped us off earlier.It was now getting close to midnight, when all of a sudden, the wind picked up to about twenty miles an hour or so.  When this happened, we all looked up through the mature hardwood trees.  When all of a sudden, four sets of spot lights came into our field of view. Two side by side, with the other two directly below the others.  They moved very slowly, just barely above the tree tops, maybe a mile or two an hour tops.There was no noise except the wind which put us all on edge, because the chance of it being a helicopter were out, due to the lack of engine or blade noise. Then it got worse, in a triangle formation the size of a 747 airplane, were two huge glowing orange balls trailing behind the spot lights giving the object shape and size.The glowing balls were at least thirty feet across or so. We sat there in a dumfounded stare, until it past out of sight, then the wind calmed down snapping us back to reality to discuss what just happened.A few minutes later are ride came and we all excitedly told him what happened as we made the four mile drive back to town. On the last mile stretch running parallel with us was a helicopter, obvious by the blade sounds, but at first sight sent a chill through us. The helicopter kept pace with us into town and then fizzled off some where.We told a few people about what we saw and of course we got the &quot;You&apos;re Crazy&quot; look a lot. Then about two weeks later my cousin was sitting on his balcony late at night having a drink, when he saw exactly what we had described, going across the woods line outside of town. We never saw this thing again, but there&apos;s lots of swamp land and woods that give good cover. Which leaves only a couple of questions, what the heck was it and why was it in the middle of B.F.E.

I remember thinking to myself &quot;must be a satellite&quot; - as I was ignorant of the subject.  I looked at it for sometime off and on as I ate with my family. I pointed it out to my mother and grandparents and they also could see it - but they where more interested in me finishing my meal so I could go play.

Also, routine commercial flights were flying to the north of us. Then, over the trees, coming from the north, flying in a southernly direction was an object.

It also had two orbs of light, one on it front underside, and back underside. the front light was white, the back blue.  The lights were odd, more orbs than the bright points normally seen on aircraft.  The also did not blink.  They did not turn off or blink.  It moved very slow, maybe 30 knots.  It took a long time for it to travel over us and down its flight path.  It also wasn&apos;t oriented in a direction a normal plane would be in.  It flew with it&apos;s smaller sides oriented to the front and back (meaning, it had no wings).  There was also no sound from it, even though it was directly above us.  It was big.

If a helicopter was flying that low, we would have heard it, and felt it. It also would have been the world&apos;s biggest helicopter, too.

They were flying quite low, lower than all of the usual airplanes that fly over our area, and they were moving smoothly at a very high speed, we only watched them for about five or six seconds before they were out of sight.

We camped on the edge of a lake called Alley&rsquo;s Pond and just after dawn on the following morning,  I got up and went outside to try my luck with some early morning fishing.  It was a clear morning with not a cloud in sight and as I looked toward the opposite side of the lake in  the eastern sky, I saw a large object hovering above the tree line about a kilometer away.The object appeared to be about a hundred meters or more across. It was saucer shaped and had a string of orange lights on the outside edge of the object which seemed to be moving around the outside circumference on the edge of the object. Although it reflected some sunlight, it appeared to be of a dull coloration. It remained motionless in the sky and I went to alert my brother who was up and about. We both stared at it for a minute or so when I suggested that we go over and have a closer look. We both got in a boat which we had and started up the outboard motor. All this time it still remained motionless about a hundred feet or so above the trees.We only moved about a hundred feet when the lights turned a blue color and the object moved at very high velocity at a forty five degree angle away form us. It did not make a sound and in an instant it was gone. To this day, I cannot get this experience out of my mind. My brother and I both saw exactly the same thing and we will occasionally bring up the subject, but otherwise it is all but forgotten.

We observed these lights June 24, 26, 27 and 28, 2007, between the hours of 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. (the one night exception we were not outside at night). The lights didn&apos;t appear in precisely the same spot, but were always about the same height (roughly 30-40 degrees above the horizon). They were red (more so earlier in the week) to a reddish-orange (more so later in the week). I would estimate the size to be larger and brighter than Mars; they were large enough that they had appeared to have a round shape to them, but weren&apos;t orbs, per se. The lights appeared in different numbers; there was always at least two, and at least once there was five. The lights would come into view, sometimes one at a time, sometimes almost simultaneously, and move on a horizontal plane (maybe with a very slight downward arc) either in the same direction or in opposite directions before fading out nearly simultaneously after 5-10 seconds. Generally, the lights would appear one at a time or almost in pairs, and move apart from the center, although it wasn&apos;t always symmetrical, and they didn&apos;t always disappear at the same instant. The lights appeared often in the same general location, but they would also appear at different spots. Once, the lights appeared in their &ldquo;usual location,&rdquo; then reappeared no more than two minutes later quite a distance away (20-30 degrees). We saw the lights more than once each night, probably as many as 5-6 times. The particular nights we saw these lights, the moon was working its way toward full and there were few clouds, so the sky was quite bright, making it more interesting that these lights showed up so brightly. It was impossible to judge their distance, but it felt like they were distant; the fact that the moon was bright would mean these lights would have to be fairly bright to get through the light pollution. Seeing as how were at the ocean and in a hotel with dozens of humming air conditioners, there was no sound connected to the sightings. Our hotel was beachfront, located on Ocean Boulevard more or less across from 27th Avenue South. We also saw the lights as we walked along the beach, and once heard someone near us say something to the effect of &ldquo;Look at the airplane!&rdquo;  As for possible explanations of the lights, they were certainly not airplanes. The airport was near our hotel, and we observed a number of planes taking off. But the lights appeared and disappeared randomly, and moved in different directions. We thought they could be signal flares, and since I&apos;m not a nautical type, I&apos;m not sure how such a thing works. However, I would expect signal flares to move up, not slowly horizontally, and not in different directions. Also, I don&apos;t know far away you could see signal flares. The color and intensity of the lights would remind you of fireworks viewed at fairly close range, but they didn&apos;t wink out quite like fireworks, instead seeming to fade from view. Additionally, they didn&apos;t &ldquo;twinkle&rdquo; the way a star does; instead, they were steady while they lasted. As for other incidental notes, there were a number of military fighter jets taking off from the nearby airport each day, but these always took off during the daytime and usually turned inland, so I don&apos;t think they were addressing the lights in any way.

I noticed that there was no light trail to the ground and that the object seemed to be BEHIND the thin layer of clouds. I looked for it to loop back in case it was a spotlight, but nothing ever came. I stayed out looking for it to come back or ANYTHING, but nothing ever came. There was NO NOISE to suggest it was a plane or any type of aircraft.

As I drove towards the base I saw a light over the runway and it just hovered there.  I could see no other lights, just a bright white light.  I had always wanted to see a UFO so was really quite excited. I was about 5 miles from the base when it took off and came over my car and headed into Mexico in nothing flat.  I had managed to stick my head out the driver door and could only see a vague shape, but definitley oval shaped.  It was huge and it was so quiet and so fast. It was out of sight in an instant.   I asked the airman at the gate if he had seen something, but when I drove up, he had been on the phone laughing and giggling and he had been facing towards the front, while the runway was behind him.

Initially we believed them to be moose or bear, but we were unable to discern the shape of their bodies, and they were soon joined by two more observers.  This had been quite an unsettling experience, however, we are each educated and not one a believer in, I guess others.  However, shortly the aura borealis spanned the northern sky in a manner I have not seen since childhood (can someone confirm this? and is there any association?) and there was an amber light at an in determinant distance which was impossibly of terrestrial origin.   Almost immediately, it was joined by a second and the lights commenced in a searching pattern.  We were quite alone and very concerned for our safety.  We immediately stopped all our light and attempted to calm one of our party members, since it seemed that it would be impossible to escape the searching lights.  We checked each of the party the next day to insure there were no marks that hadn&apos;t been previously.

As I was driving home approx 1/4 of a mile to my house, I saw an enormous disc shaped craft in the sky to my left. If you saw seven to ten low flying airplanes side by side I would quess that to be the size of it. It appeared to be a very large dark disc shape with bright yellow lights in the center, the lights were so bright they looked like large flourecent bulbs in the center.

As he passed me by I saw the object moving quickly to the south west.

The sun had set about an hour ago when the incident occurred.  My family (my parents and my brother) were having an after-dinner tea time at the balcony of our apartment; and I was in my room.  Our apartment was located at the top of a hill in the city, where the most of the north side of the city was visible from. Then my brother came into my room shouting that there was something strange in the sky. I rushed out to the balcony. The object was about 5- 8 kilometers away, at an altitude of 1500 - 2000 meters above the city. It was huge.  Comparing with the buildings at that distance, I can say that it was 150-200 meters in diameter.  The object had a very bright silvery metal color. It was self luminous, and a &ldquo;haze&rdquo; of bright white light was surrounding it. It&rsquo;s difficult to describe its shape because of the brightness and the &ldquo;light&rdquo; surrounding it. The &ldquo;haze&rdquo; was not homogeneous; it had a somewhat patchy appearance, and for short durations of time (5 to 10 seconds), it was possible to see parts of the thing inside. The inside object was roughly egg-shaped, but its shape was constantly changing. The &ldquo;shell of the egg&rdquo; was fluctuating like the appearance of the surface of wavy melted metal.  It looked as if something inside, trying to come out, were forcing and deforming the wall. The object had not moved around and stayed still at that location for about 2-3 minutes. Then suddenly something even more strange had happened:  The object had gradually expanded 2-3 times in diameter while its brightness had increased making it difficult to look at it directly, and then it &ldquo;exploded&rdquo; without making any noise (in fact, no sound at all could be heard during the whole incident). This event took about 10 seconds.  In a few seconds after the explosion, all the &ldquo;white &ndash; silvery &ndash; bright&rdquo; haze and other things had disappeared, and numerous (about 50 or so of them) spherical objects came out of it.  The spheres were also luminous but not that bright. They had pale neon colors on their surface with a thin layer of &ldquo;haze&rdquo;.  The spheres were all identical to each other. They were perfect spheres in shape.  Although it is difficult to make a correct estimate, based on their distance and their altitude, I can say that their diameters were about 20 meters or so. No details (windows, signs, etc.) were seen on their surfaces, except that their ever changing pale neon colors. Immediately after their appearance, the spheres started to move towards south (towards our location).  They moved horizontally at a constant speed, and did not change direction. Their speed was about twice or three times faster than an airliner. They moved all together at the same speed, side- by-side; but they were not lined up in perfect rows. They did not make any sound at all. They did not leave any trails behind them while they move. They passed over the roof and disappeared from our sight. Besides us, thousands of people of the city had observed the incident. The incident took place in local newspapers next day. The government agencies explained the incident as &ldquo;a meteorite passing over the city&rdquo;. That spectacular show was the most extraordinary event of my life.

Around 10:30pm I noticed something in the sky, it was a large black triangle with 2 bright white lights on the back points.  This large craft floated overhead in kind of a horseshoe like move then it went off slowly, to the right in a straight line. It didn&apos;t make any sound at all.

We kept watching this craft go to the right of us, then it seemed to pause, the lights seemed to get brighter... then all of the sudden the white lights turned to orange and the entire craft disappeared. At this point the 3 of us determined this thing was definitely a UFO.  I am not saying that this craft must be extraterrestrial, but if it is man made it is being kept a secret from the public.

We both had not consumed any alcohol our drugs.Circa 1 kilometre before we reached our village we saw a red-orange lighting oval object  which flew over a hill right next to the site. It was less than 50 metres over the ground near a power pole (perhaps in 200 or 300 metres distance from the pole) and flew very slow and irregulary from one side to the other in an area of about 50 metres.We watched the ufo for three or four minutes (as we discovered it, we immediately stopped our moped) and could see that the object slowly changed its shape from elliptical into roundly and back again into elliptical for some times. Also it looked like it was completely enclosed by a kind of orange fire, but this fire didn&apos;t jitter.Than we decided to take a closer look on it and drove up on the hill. On our way we had to drive through the village for some minutes and could not see the ufo in this time. Reaching the top of the hill we saw that the object was no longer here but somewhere over the neighbour-village, in a distance of about 2 or 3 kilometres, perhaps up to 5 km, I don&apos;t know exactly. Because the object could be seen from the house of my parents, we quickly drove forward to me.At home, I searched for my mother&apos;s photo camera, and because of the noise she woke up. I told her what was going on outside, and so we went into the garden and watched the object staying at the same place near the next village, changing its shape and brightness. At ca. 4:00 I could see that its brightness went darker and darker, and at last it dissapeared in nothingness after over an hour.I took eight photos of the ufo, but I was very surprised as I saw them some days later:   1.) I choosed a long exposure time for the camera, but just on two of the eight photos you can see something more than black sky.2.)  It was also surprising that there were TWO objects on the photos! Both stood not in the center of the image but could be connected by an imaginary line which leads through the center   3.)

Clear Lake was celebrating the forth of July with fireworks on July 7th, 2007 at about 9:50pm. The fireworks lasted until around 10:30 pm. My family, including my son-in-law and his wife and kids, were standing on our pier just as the fireworks ended. It was a crystal clear evening and you could easily see the left-over smoke from the fireworks against the darkening starlit night. The left-over firework smoke was drifting about 2-300 feet high and 500 yards out from me moving left to right as we stood on the pier looking to the north. My 36 year old son-in-Law pointed out this moving object to our left above the firework smoke moving left to right seemingly glowing like a flame. It was circular and it appeared to look like the fire and glow of the tail pipe of a fighter jet without noise or sound. The object was the size of a medium aircraft but perfectly round. The object was moving much faster then the firework smoke still drifting across the northern sky. I look even further back to my left and it looked like several of these fiery objects were line up in single file like you would see at an airport with airplanes lined up to land. The fiery objects past over head right in front of us in single file and moved rapidly east and upwards until they when out of sight. I counted eight of them which flu west to east almost horizon to horizon. As a 15 year veteran NBC affiliate director/producer in television, I frequently carry a video camera for chasing storms and news stories and decided to run to grab my video camera in our cottage during the sighting. It only took me seconds to grab my video gear but before I could get it started recording I was only able to video tape one single object flying left to right climbing out of sight like the other seven objects. Then two more of the objects with the same look, flying perfectly parallel to each other flu to the center of the lake and follow the exact same course until the two glow flame objects perfectly turn together in unison and instead of following the rest of the glow-flame objects to the east, they headed directly straight to the north where I facing during the time I was video taping. The other eight objects all flew to the east and climbed out of sight, but the last two that flew side-by-side did not climb like the others but kept the same altitude of about one thousand feet until they drop from sight in the northern horizon. The whole event lasted about 20-30 minutes with the objects seemingly spaced evenly apart. The firework smoke was still slowly drifting east about 5 miles and hour after the incendent. These objects maneuvered about and were traveling much faster then the firework smoke. I stood there on the pier looking at one last glowing light that did not move in the west and I was not sure that it was another glow-flame object. I gave it about 5 minutes and wrote it off to being a water tower beacon off in the distance.  I went inside the cottage for a bit and returned in about 20 minutes later to find that the object I waiting on, that I thought was a water tower beacon we not in the west  and in fact, there were no lights at all. So then I assume it was one of the objects I had been witnessing and did not stick around long enough to see where that UFO headed.   There were many people on the lake that night and witnessed these objects. I work with a man who was at the yacht club on the lake that night with approximately 100 guests for a graduation party who all witnessed the fireworks and the same objects. I called 911 and to my surprise no one had reported what I had seen. There have not been any reports in newspapers or media since then. I have talked to a few people who live at the lake who claim they either saw the objects that night or heard about it.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone for an extended amount of time.  He is a serior executive for a major company, and we deem him to be an excellent witness.

Whether these were new military aircraft or &quot;UFO&apos;s&quot; I don&apos;t know.  It did seem rather odd that they were all flying about the same speeds, at the same time, in different directions.

The slow moving light got brighter and shaped more like a cylinder and sped away at a extremely fast speed. The ufo was only in my sight for about 3seconds.

Anyway, after about 5 seconds at its brightest and biggest point, it immediately shot straight into the sky at an incredible rate of speed until it was merely a pinpoint of light about the size of a very distant star. It continued to move slowly at that point until it was out of view completely. I barely had time to mention it to my friends before it was too small to see, so as far as I know there were no other witnesses near me. I did not notice any other lights on the object and am quite certain that it was not an airplane, and it certainly moved faster and in a way that I&apos;ve never seen a traditional aircraft move.

My ex noticed it first-- a really bright star kind of zigzagging in place, then my buddy saw it and they were both able to describe what was going on, so I knew he wasn&apos;t making it up.   We all looked up and watched it for a while.  It was really far up, so it looked like a star, but it was super bright and it moved way too much.  It was way too far to be a helicopter or a plane, and even though a shuttle had launched a few days ago, it moved way too fast to be one.

I saw the triangle in fort Collins Colorado the same time as the triangle in St. Louis that I have been seeing. It is following me everywhere. In Fort Collins there was also fireballs in the sky.

I was on Parker Rd. on my way to Hwy 75 North from the direction of Custer Rd.  The bright light looked like it was hovering in mid air and not moving. At first I thought it was a light on top of a building, but I had never seen it before, so I kept looking while I was driving.  Finally I pulled over into a bank parking lot on Parker Rd. near the street that leads to Hwy 75 North, to get a better look.  Very soon after I parked, the light went out and what looked like a low flying airplane flew over me in the sky.  I could hear the aircraft pass as it passed over me.  So, I thought nothing of it, because I was then pretty sure it was just an airplane, but after I got on 75 North heading towards Allen, TX, I saw the light again, now in a different place.Again, the light was stationary, not moving even a little bit from what I could see.  I called my fiance to see if he could see what I was seeing, but he was at work and could not see anything from his perspective.  He was in Richardson, about 20 minutes away from where I was when I called him.As I was speaking with my fiance on the phone, the light seemed to go out in a small sweeping motion from left to right, and then I could see flashing lights moving slowly.  By this time I had reached my exit, Exchange Pkwy, and I was only able to see the lights for a short while longer before I had to make the turn onto Exchange Pkwy heading west.  Once I started heading west, my back was to the lights and I couldn&apos;t track them anymore.While I was able to observe the lights, they looked closer together than a normal aircraft&apos;s lights would be, and the lights appeared to move in the same sweeping motion from left to right.  The motion of the lights made the flying object seem to be a circular shape rather than the shape of an airplane like I had seen when I parked in the bank parking lot on Parker Rd.Also, the lights, which I assume were attached to some sort of aircraft, were moving slowly across the sky and looked as thought they were making oddly angled turns, speeding up, although not very much, and slowing down as they went along.  There were three lights, all different colors.  I believe the colors were blue, red, and green, but they were hard to distinguish, because I was trying to watch the road and the thing in the sky at the same time.  I am not sure how long the event lasted, as I do not know when the light first appeared, nor was not able to stop my car to observe the whole thing.I do not drink, so consequently, I have not consumed any alcoholic beverages tonight, nor do I use/abuse drugs of any kind, legal or prescription.  The only medication I take daily is Wellbutrin XL for depression.  I do not have a history of any other psychiatric disorders, nor do I have a history of seeing odd things in the sky or anywhere else for that matter.

About fifteen minutes into my drive I started spotting a red light that looked far away from me. I figured the red light was a plane or a tower of some sort, but I kept seeing it for the next ten minutes. This red light was not blinking or flashing just a constant beam of red light. Then all of the sudden it disappeared from the spot I was seeing it from. After about a minute or two the light appeared right above my car and it was following me. The light was much brighter now it was hard to focus on the road. I was trying to drive and look up at the same time. The object was maybe 10 feet above my car and I was traveling at approximately 40 miles per hour. It was hovering above me following me for about five minutes. The object made no noise.

The things that interested me most was 1) It was NOT flashing.2) There was NO sound.3) There was no trails of any kind and NO smoke.4) It was an incredibly bright white light that seems to be round. The size was either massive because it was close, or it was the light it was emitting was just very bright. It never dimmed. In fact it stayed the same brightness as it passed over me and only faded as it got far away. Had the hospital not been blocking a further view, I estimate I would have seen it for a few miles.

I remember that date and time exactly because that is my birthday and we were headed to our home for a &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; party. We noticed a very low flying bright &ldquo;diamond shaped&rdquo; light, flying just above tree level alongside the freeway. It was headed east bound as we were west bound. It was only approximately 100 feet up. At first we thought it was a helicopter because of the slow flight. We rolled down our windows to see and hear it better and we heard absolutely nothing. We then pulled off onto the side of the freeway, got out of our car and watched it. Usually even against a very dark sky, you can make out the outline of a helicopter or whatever, but we could make out NOTHING of any shape other than the diamond-shaped light. Suddenly, it &ldquo;dropped&rdquo; four different lighted objects&hellip;I first thought they were flares, but after dropping approx. 10-15 feet, each of the smaller &ldquo;lights&rdquo; took off in level flight in 4 different directions. We were stunned. We jumped in our car and followed the closest one, which was headed west, which was towards the Long Beach Naval Station. We drove to a high point, at a Mall, where we got out of our car and watched. From this vantage point we were able to track and see all four of the &ldquo;lights&rdquo; in the distance. In the meantime, after dropping the 4 &ldquo;lights&rdquo;, the main diamond-shaped light turned and headed slowly north/northeast,  in the direction of Anaheim. After about 15-20 minutes, the 4 lights started heading N/NE back towards the main light. We again jumped in our car and followed as quickly as we could towards Anaheim. We then actually saw each of the individual 4 lights arrive at the main &ldquo;diamond-shaped&rdquo; light and slowly rise up into the &ldquo;light&rdquo; After all 4 were retrieved, the main diamond-shaped light took off at considerable speed to the north where we lost sight of it. I do NOT believe in &ldquo;little green men&rdquo;. We checked the papers the next day and saw no other reports of this sighting, which is mind-boggling because of its location, and the duration of the incident.

The reason I&apos;m submiting another report is because since my last report I&apos;ve found one other person who wittnesed the same event as I did on Monday last. I don&apos;t know if you ever got my last report but I will copy/paste it from documents now.........I don&apos;t know if this is the right place to submit this but at 5:05 am MDT on Monday, July 9th, 2007, I witnessed an anomaly in the sky. I was outside facing the west when I saw an object move across the sky from south to north. It is impossible to judge the size of this object because I didn&rsquo;t have a frame of reference for depth of field. It did give me a feeling of impossibly large however. It was also traveling at a speed that would be impossibly fast as far as what aircraft known to me would be able to travel. It was oval in shape on the horizontal and had no noticeable trail behind it nor tail of any kind. It gave me the feeling of being solid and not atmospheric in nature, but I could not describe it on more than two dimensions because it passed my whole field of view in only a few seconds. There is a small municipal airport close by and I know what I saw was not the usual scanning beam that one would see from the airport revolving light.  It was very bright blue/indigo in color with a slight fringe of a lighter almost cream color on its perimeter and was obviously emitting it&rsquo;s own light and was not a reflection of any kind. As it passed rather low in the western sky from my observation point in southern New Mexico it seemed to have a path that followed the curvature of the earth and not rising in altitude nor was it falling like a meteor might be expected to do when entering the earths atmosphere. As it left my field of view then it appeared to be traveling at about 5 to 15 points north. I am not a UFO enthusiast and have no particular beliefs for or against UFOs. I guess I&rsquo;m trying to say that I&rsquo;m not some kind of nut who &ldquo;sees things&rdquo;.

It was kind of strange. We drove another ten kilometers and this object kept the same distance from the car above us on the passenger&rsquo;s side.I guess I got brave our stupid and stopped the car, got out and got a good look at the object that was spinning slowly in front of the car moving over a house then stopped spinning and started spinning counter clock wise coming back towards us. To get an approximation on the size of it I would have to know how high that he was flying, what I do know for sure is that it was close and large maybe the size of a football field and it still made no sound.

When we reached Boekel we were driving under a lot of trees so we couldn&rsquo;t see anything following us any more my wife said drive fast and hide the car in our garage so I did we got out of the car and ran inside the house. I told the baby sitter and she said that it was a shame that she couldn&rsquo;t have seen it. Me being of the nosey types had to look outside and to my horror it was hovering above the neighbors house but now it was very close and I could see from the lights that he was slanting down in my direction I could no longer see the under side just one row of lights, looking at me. I called for the baby sitter and my wife to come outside, but when they did the thing took off like a rocket. I mean a blink of your eye as fast as light. Then the two ladies went back inside, a minute later it came back and I called the ladies back. This time the object stayed and the baby sitter turned a little shade of white and said that she was going home because this was scary. Then she departed for her house. Just them my neighbor was returning home from a party. Walked over to me and the object took off again.

I was leaving a friend&rsquo;s home with my mother when I noticed an extremely bright light off in the distance. The light was yellow, spherical and stationary.  My mother confirmed the light. I walked my mother to the car, and when I looked back, the light had disappeared entirely.  This instance was extraordinary in that there were no ordinary lights to be seen anywhere.  Moreover, the cloud cover allowed no other stars to be seen.  The night was exceptionally dark.  When I first saw the object, I believed it to be a star.  However, after further inspection, I believed it to be far too large and far too bright to be an ordinary star.  In addition, I believe that if it had been a star, it would have been shrouded by the cloud cover, and, as a result, would not have been visible at all, or would have been quite dull.  It was apparent that this object was beneath the cloud cover. Even more, the light seemed to be slightly pulsing. I stood and watched it for about ten seconds. I intended to observe it more, but when I looked back, it was gone. I returned to my vehicle to check whether or not there was any radio interference. There was not.I am a senior at a major university studying philosophy.

Sighting lasted about 10 minutes beginning at about 8pm CDT on Thursday, 5 July 2007.I was sitting in a lawn chair outdoors at a swing and big band concert offered by the city in downtown Ralston facing south.  The crowd was of about 75 was mainly made up of people in their 50s to 70s years of age and some in front of me began pointing up to the daytime cloudless sky, and I looked up to at first see five bright silver starlike points of light in the sky stationary and in a zigzag like pattern.  Within minutes I counted 7 and then I counted 9 and then 10 in all stationary across the sky of various intensities and all silver in color except one fainter one which had a reddish tint.  None blinked or pulsated but looked more like how Venus currently looks in the western sky vs a twinkling star affect.Since the sun was low on the horizon, the brightness appeared to be reflection.  Knowing how bright the International Space Station can be after sunset when its orbit is just right and how bright satellites can be in the early evening, these objects could have been at a very high altitude and hence could have been seen across a widespread area and hopefully others have seen something similar.The lights were not evenly spread out but some were alone and some were in somewhat close groups of two or three in no particular pattern.  After about 5 minutes, three of the lights moved in all different directions and the group farthest to the southeast made a  tight triangle around the reddish light.  After a few more minutes, in this same area, four lights moved close to one another to form a rough letter C.About ten minutes after first seeing this strange event, a high flying aircraft flew across the sky from east to west and when it did, coincidentally all but one of the lights vanished and by the time the airplane crossed that area to the west, the last light was gone as well.I did not have nor did I see anyone there with a camera or video equipment to record this event.I saw no more starlike items in the sky until after sunset an hour and a half later when Venus was visible and by 9:45 several of the brighter stars came out as normal.I am familiar with planes and satellites and what I saw was not those.  I am familiar with the brightness of white-breasted geece flying and how the sun can reflect off them and what they look like and what I saw was not birds.

I went to the newely built Firewheel Town Center to watch fireworks and noticed one of these similar lights in the sky and thought I would take pictures since the fireworks had not started.  When I took the pictures I had the zoom on my digital camera on all the way.  I was kind of amazed at what I saw when I zoomed into the pictures on word like it was changing shapes.  The sky was pitch black and there was a smaller star looking thing close by.  The fireworks would have been going off infront of where I was and this light was on my right.

It was about 3 miles in front of me on the south of the highway and appeared to be shaped like an aircraft (minus the wings).I could not understand why an aircraft would be so low and so far from the airport, but figured it could be some strange personal aircraft over a residential area.  As I approached (nearing the State Street exit), multiple vehicles on the highway were braking to look at the strange object.  Once within a &frac12; mile of the object, I knew it was not an aircraft (at least not a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; one).It reminded me of a torpedo: silver and shiny with &ldquo;fins&rdquo; on one end, but no noticeable &ldquo;cockpit&rdquo; areas. (I think there may have been a very skinny &ldquo;window like&rdquo; opening on the bottom.)   After this closer inspection, I thought that it could be &quot;a skinny blimp&quot; or &quot;weather balloon&quot;, but again, there were no noticeable windows NOR an engine or propellers.  Additionally, there were no flashing lights and it held completely stationary in the sky. There was NO MOVEMENT at all despite tree blowing in the breeze. As I passed it perpendicularly on the highway, I studied the space below the craft for a tether, but saw no indication that it was attached to the ground. As I merged onto I-15 (northbound), I looked in my rearview mirror and was still able to see the craft hovering in what appeared to be the same location.I estimate that the object was about 75-100 feet above the ground and approximately 20-25 feet long.

It then started to move on after being virtually still, gaining speed then suddenly disappearing, as if it were switched off. It then reappeared a little further down range moving southeast.

We watched it as we talked as we knew there was no tower or anything there. We eventually noticed it was slowly moving towards us. It took a good 20 minutes to go from the horizon to overhead. There was no sound and no other light. It did not variate in brightness at any angle. It seemed to stop overhead, maybe 3000 feet or less. Just far enough that a spotlight could not hit it. It drifted like a hot air balloon in speed. While watching, I called the ATC tower at the local airport.  They confirmed they could see it visually but did not know what it was.

Nobody knows about it, or the other countless abductions I&apos;ve had for as long back as I remember. The first time I remember there being quiet bright lights in the sky above the back yard. I felt this strong urge to go outside and check it out. and when I did, they took me. And they&apos;ve been taking me ever since. SOmetimes they&apos;d come for me, other times they called me and I would have no choice but to them. I did tell my parents about it once, as a little kid, around 6 years old, when the Greys left me in my living room insted of dropping me back in my bedroom. They blamed it on sci-fi movies and videogames and I got yelled at for making up stories. That was the only time I tried to tell anyone. When I moved from home into my appartment, I slept with a 9mm. under my pillow for months, but I was always paralised when they would come for me, so that idea was a bust. Setting up video cameras in my bedroom proved ineffective as well. In the morning, the tapes would be blank, like I never set them to record at all. And after a while, the fear dissapeared from the abductions and I started to accept that getting pulled out of my room on random nights was just something I&apos;d have to deal with. One night in July of 2001, I was abducted. It seemed business as usual. I was called to the room of my appartment and then the flash filled my eyes, and when it cleared, I was laying on the table again. The grays usually planted dozens of accupuncture type needles in my chest, stomach, neck. Rarely they would insert a tube into my ear or throat which was quite painful. This time was the tube in my throat. As the machine was being prepared, several of the grays seemed to rushin from another room. They spoke to the ones about to experiment on me, and they all ran from the room. I felt a rumble in the table I was laying on and heard a loud explosion, followed by what seemed to be weapons fire. Several minuets passed and then a tall, armored figure wearing a blank faced mask entered the room, carrying a type of weapon, resembeling an assault rifle. The figure removed the mask to reveal a very canine like face, with bright orange eyes, covered by short, blue fur. The usual abduction experience was frightening, but seeing this new creature made me feel like my heart would beat out of my chest. The being leaned over the instrument table the grays kept their tools on and began touching the objects there. Suddenly I could move again. The creature came over to me and gently helped me into a sitting position on the table. Then, in plane English, asked if I was alright. I told her(I say &apos;her&apos; because the voice of the being sounded most definitely female to me) yes and asked what was happening. I rose from the table, and she led me from the exam room. outside the room, in the large halls of the ship, there were dead bodies of grays around every corner. Creatures like her, and several other new strange creatures were at control panles and moving about the ship. The creature introduced herself at this point as Boudica(boo-dee-ca) and told me that this ship was going to be destroyed. I asked her why and what was going on. She then exlained to me something I never thought of in all the time I was being abducted: The grays, in reality were a cybernetic lifeform created by Boudica&apos;s race and more than 3 dozen other races in contact with each other on the other side of the Milky Way. Centuries ago, they formed a union with each other to establish trade, travle and the discovery of new lifeforms across the universe. However, space travle was a long, difficult affair. So these large, strong alien races created the small, weak looning grays as sort of advanced scouts, used to seek out, examine and greet new intelegent lifeforms as they found it. They gray body design was chosen because the alien union thought that body shape the least threatening. They in general being tall and muscular, they couldn&apos;t see the gray body type being a threat to anyone. As I proceded through the ship, I noticed gray bodis being carried through the hall, some in peices. And sure enough, in the open wounds of the grays there were servos, wires and components I could not identify in my limited experience. Boudica took me to a room filled with several other large aliens. One alien, an 8 foot tall being who appeared to have a reptilian face with a feathery red crest around its head, asked how long they grays had been taking me. I told him(?) the last 15 years and he apoligised to me for all the pain and trouble I&apos;ve been through. Then he promised me I&apos;d never have to go through any of that again. Boudica told me I&apos;d have to be put to sleep to be transported back to my appartment, because they didn&apos;t fully understand the methods the grays used to teleport people from place to place. She took a long rod like instrument from the control panle and waved it once in front of my face. That is the last I remembered from the gray ship. It has been more than 6 years since I&apos;ve been abducted. I&apos;ve tried to make sense of the events on the gray&apos;s ship tha night. As far as I can figure, they grays were supposed to be a scouting party to survey newly discovered intelegent races in secret. For whatever reason, they failed their mission, and would not stop abducting people and experimenting on them. So, the ALien union who created them is now in the process of finding and destroying them. It is my beliefe that whe the Ailen union finally destroys the threat to Earth posed by the grays, then they might finally make their existence known to humanity and induct us into their collection of races across the universe.

I veered off on to the Rodney Parham Rd exit ramp and turned into a parking lot of a shopping center, to watch this object.  This object appeared as though it was on fire but was too big to be a meteor and moving incrfedibly slow.  I would estimate its air speeed was at most 30 mph, about 4 minutes into the observation of this object its course veered upwards and towards the south.  It behaved like it was trying to climb up but was having difficulty.  It then reached an altitude where clouds were present because I could not see the stars in that direction.

Did not make any sound, could clearly see an uneven smoke line following bright object, which after 10-15 seconds gradually disappeared-either behind a distance building or by just disappearing. The object was very bright white with a sort of orange fuzz surrounding it while it maintained a strong circular shape. I seen it by complete coincidence while i was closing my blinds in my bedroom so I unsure whether it had been across the whole sky or not.", "Fast, white, solid lightI&apos;m usually skeptical about these, but I saw a curious light this evening around 9:30pm. My wife saw it and said &quot;probably a plane&quot;.   But I had watched 4 other aircraft fly overhead and this object was different.  It was about a third as bright as Venus and maybe about 2/3 the size.  It looked like a star, definitely had an altitude greater than any of the aircraft I&apos;d seen. Just a bright, white light. What was odd to me was that it moved at a much greater speed than any of the aircraft. I saw it coming from the southern horizon, moving smooth and fast, it disappeared over the northern horizon only 10 seconds later. I&apos;ve never seen anything that high cover that much ground in such a short amount of time. I thought possibly satellite, but south to north? Weird. The other weird thing is that every plane I&apos;ve ever seen had at least some sort of blinking lights, even if only one. This was a single, solid white light.((NUFORC Note: ISS??  PD))", "I was driving north on Fairfax Co. Parkway between Herndon and Sterling around 8:00pm when a rather large glowing object brought my eyes up to it.  As soon as my eyes were able to focus on it the the glowing circular object accelerated very rapidly traveling toward the north in a straight horizontal line and vanished.  It must have been going well into the thousands of miles an hour, but without knowing the size and altitude, I can only say It made those fighter jets at the air show look slow.  By the way the object was considerably larger than the biggest star. There was no sound and no trail.  I will be reporting another siting from 06/07/07 which finally compelled me to report this.", "Two Bright White Lights In North Central Wa StateI was at a lake in north central Washington state, camping.  I&rsquo;d been seeing some fighter jets and commercial jets and private craft, so got used to seeing these relatively creeping across the sky or horizon.  Well, on Tuesday night (6/19), two very bright white lights moved slightly down at an angle, in a straight line, in unison, from west to east, covering a lot of sky in a couple seconds (what would take much longer for known aircraft).  They then were just as suddenly moving away to the south so fast the bright lights faded from view after a couple more seconds.  I also heard no noise at all, and they were much closer than jets I&apos;d heard during the day.  The bright white lights were exactly as bright and just as unbelievably fast as the one I saw recently near Soap Lake, WA.", "Multiple crafts sitedI was sitting outside after watching fireworks with my family, I was alone. I looked up at the sky and I focused on one &quot;star&quot;. After a while I noticed the &quot;star&quot; started moving. I thought my eyes were playing tricks wth me, so I focused on another star. To prove my point the second star didn&apos;t move. I turned toward the first star. It was still there but in a different location. I kept looking at it think it might have been a plane, but I don&apos;t know of any plane that emits a white light and hovers. So then I thought it was a helicopter. But I know helicopters can&apos;t fly that high. Then it moved in a straight line, but it wasn&apos;t no usual line. As it was moving it would shuttered. It would dip down and then back up, while keeping it&apos;s forward momentum. Then it stopped. During this time I was rushing around to find my video camera, but when I found it I couldn&apos;t focus enough on it to get a good picture. I couldn&apos;t see anything through the camera, so I put it down. And in the corner of my eye I saw more movement. I turn towards the movement and I noticed two lights moving in a cirrcular motion. They stopped and then one took off going away from me and as it was leaving it would pulse a white light. It would light up and then slowly die out. It repeated this until I lost sight of it. Then I looked at the other one. It did the same thing maybe a minute later. Then I looked back at the first &quot;star&quot;. It was in the same area but once again it moved in location. Then I saw another light leave from the star I was looking at and I followed that with my eyes. Then I would look at other lights noticing that most of them moved in the way the first one did. I kept watching them, not noticing the almost 2 hours have past. I hated to leave it but I had to go to sleep. But all day today I have been thinking about what I had seen last night. I still don&apos;t know what to make of it.", "Silent, disk-shaped object observed floating, flipping end-over-end in broad daylight for about 15 minutesI was taking my kids to school around 9am.  As we pulled into a parking lot near 125th and Antioch, my daughter asked what that was in the sky.  I looked up and saw a disk shaped object flipping end over end floating slowly across the sky.  We stopped the car and got out. We watched the object for 10-15 minutes.  It flipped end over end slowly and moved as if floating like a balloon from east-south-east to west-north-west.  It almost seemed dormant and non-deliberate if not for the fact it was floating opposite the direction of the wind.  There were no sudden movements in any direction besides the flipping end over end and sideways. As it twisted and turned slowly, there were times it turned in such a way I could see the profile of the object.  It was very, very thin so it was obviously not air filled and buoyant, but rather afloat due to something other than light or hot air.  It was shiny and metallic.  On one side of the object when in full view like looking down at a plate sitting flat on a table, it had three circles in a triangular pattern.  Because I had no idea how big it was I couldn&rsquo;t tell how high up in the air it was floating.  It appeared to be about the same size as if you held a silver dollar in your outstretched hand.  It was completely silent, made no sound at all. As we watched the object float toward the west, I noticed a second one nearby that I had not noticed before, probably because I was so fixated on the first object, afraid it would disappear if I turned away.  The two objects appeared to be spinning and flipping in tandem. Because I was with my 6 year old daughter and 2 year old son and seemed to be the only adult seeing the object which was very clearly large enough to see, I was shouting at anyone I could find in the same parking lot to just get confirmation that what we were seeing was real and get their instinct on what it was.  A few people saw it and said things like &ldquo;what is that?&rdquo;  None of us could figure any other explanation because it was silent, metal and obviously not floating because it was full of air.", "(Cols,Ohio) 2 bright objects, great distance from each other move in exact unison from W into SW Sky, disappear simultaneouslyMy husband and I stepped outside last Wednesday evening, around 11pm June 20th.    It was a lovely evening, clear skies in all directions.   He faced East, I turned to look at the moon hanging in the western sky.I immediately noticed a very very bright object moving out of the west, moving very fast.   I began to ask my husband if it was probably a satellite, because I could not see any type of blinking as with most airplanes.We squinted, trying to decipher if there was blinking or not,  but he saw no blinking either. Right then we both noticed a second very bright object following at the exact same speed, in the exact same direction as the first. From the ground, the bright objects would have appeared about 8-10 inches apart, so I don&rsquo;t know what the actual distance would calculate to be,   but they were in unison , appearing as if the second object were being towed along. We deliberated for a minute or two, concluding, that for satellites,  they were flying at a really low elevation ,  looking like they were inside our atmosphere,  not orbiting outside of it;   And they were so bright,  as compared to most satellites which are usually only as bright as the stars &amp; moving across the sky at a slow but steady rate. My husband and I are very reasonable, logical people.   It was our instinct to dismiss the objects as some logical device which was operating normally in the sky.However,  standing there&hellip;.. suggesting, squinting, contemplating the possibilities of what they were,  we suddenly saw the first object fade quickly and disappear completely.We were both astounded at this point.     Questioning why and where it could have gone,   watching the second object follow the same path,  &amp; at the exact same place in the sky,&hellip;&hellip;it too faded very quickly and disappeared completely.By now we were absolutely confused at what in the world we could be seeing.              The sky was completely clear &amp;  the objects were gone, just like that. They traveled out of the western sky in unison, and disappeared into the Southwestern sky at the same place in the sky.We talked excitedly and returned inside after a few moments.   My husband headed to bed.   I sat down to watch some Tv.At about 1am,  I was too curious to sleep without knowing, so I called Rickenbacher Airport, and was transferred to airport operations.I explained to the man on the phone, and he confirmed that he also saw the objects in the sky at that time.   He remembered seeing them because he too noticed how fast they were traveling.He had no actual confirmation,   but assumed the first object we saw was the international space station,  because it &lsquo;probably&rsquo; has its solar panels out right now.  I said okay,   and mentioned again that they seemed so close,   too close to be floating outside of the earth.I asked him what was trailing it so far behind the object at the same speed, and he said he did not know what that could have been.     He told me they appeared to disappear  because at a certain point on the horizon, the sunlight does not reach the object anymore and it appears to disappear.     I accepted this.My husband brought up the point that the objects were no where near the horizon,   they were way up in the sky, almost overhead.    Im sure it is possible though. My father keeps  suggesting it was the Space station and that the object behind it was probably the space shuttle which would be docked on it or very close. However,   the distance even from our view was already too far for the objects to be docked together,  let alone what the actual distance would be up there.He also supported the disappearing horizon theory. When I thought about it later  I realized Rickenbacher is a military installation.   I had called them thinking they would be a better authority than Port Columbus,    but now I realize, if there were anything unidentified up there,    a military installation would be the last to confirm it. And so we left it at that.        No answers for the boatload of questions in our minds. I have seen now that a Pilot flying over the English Channel last week, along with his passengers, all witnessed a very large Unidentified craft outside of their windows.     After it moved out of site,  the pilot stated that a second object appeared 5 minutes later.  I do not know whether the two sightings are related but I see an amazing coincidence between the timing and actual objects seen.((NUFORC Note:  ISS?

This orb was flashing red and passed directly to the left of my side only about 10 feet off the side of the plane.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first I thought the lights were stars.  Then I wondered why I had never noticed these stars before.  As I walked I watched as the two stars begin to pulsate.  They got brighter and dimmer at a steady pace and then just disapeared.  About 30 seconds later they came back on and did the same thing again.  I hurried to the tent and got the first person I saw to watch for it again.  We stood there for another few minutes waiting but they never came back.", "It was nothing like anything we had ever seen, it was small though, and blackish, shiny, it flew wobbly..This is a really diffrent sighting, thats why no website will investigate it. This IS a serious letter, I AM SERIOUS.We were watching a new TV show called Is it Real? It was one on Atlantis, about 2 min to the end they are interviewing a man standing in front of an ancient pyramid or something like that, for an instant I thought a bird few behind him and into the building, but something didnt sit right. I rewound it and here there was something....it was nothing like we have ever ever ever seen! It was small, that threw me, it was though shaped like what I have heard these look like, but not really, this one was so small! I went frame by frame and saw this black ish, object, it was shiny, no windows I dont think. I was really wobbly, it turned on its side, then of ALL things it looked like it flew into the building where no window was! At least I dont think so, it looked like a ledge behind him, but it flew behind him at the last second so we couldn&apos;t see it all. Honest to my God, this DID happen, and it was NOT a bird, it was NOTHING any of us have EVER seen before, and it flew nothing like we had ever seen before! HOW could the editor miss it, unless his mind thought it to be a bird as well! We would give anything to have someone look at it, anyone, just for the reassurance we are right, but we KNOW we are, it is just too astounding! I have it on my tape, I dont know how anyone would get it to see it. I am writing the show tonight though since no one else will even look, I just wanted to report this just in case it is ever rebroadcast so others can pay attention!", "Fireball in the sky over the Susquehanna River in Williamsport, PA.My partner and I were out on the Susquehanna River in our cabin cruiser. Shortly after sunset we were motoring slowing up the river, which is actually westbound watching the campers along the river close up their sites for the weekend since it was a Sunday night. Naturally as soon as the sun had gone down the air temperature became a little cooler and my partner went below to stay warm while I continued to slowly &ldquo;chug&rdquo; up the river enjoying the calm, cool weather.Approximately around 9:45-9:50 I was looking directly ahead of the boat. Just above the small hill there was a bright orange/reddish light. Since it was near the top of the hill, I didn&rsquo;t give it much thought thinking it wasn&rsquo;t anything special. I had just thought it was someone hosting a bonfire party to end the weekend. So I glanced away for a few seconds to see the camp sites along the river and when I returned looking forward the light had definitely increased in altitude. This caused me to wonder what it was since it was an odd color. It was EXACTLY the same color as a camp fire, a very big and brilliant camp fire in the sky. It surpassed in size and brilliance any other lights in the sky including airplanes, stars, planets, etc.At this point I thought &ldquo;How strange? Normally an airplane would not be an orange color!&rdquo; I pulled back the throttle of the boat into neutral and examined this strange light. It raised directly above the western horizon in altitude and followed an arch like course directly over top of us. As it approached it gained more and more altitude. Which was strange because I thought if it was a plane, like I have seen many times before, the altitude would not increase so drastically. I could tell the altitude was increasing because as it came closer to us overhead, it became dimmer and dimmer. I couldn&rsquo;t make out any type of shape except it looked like a camp fire in the sky. Orange/Reddish color with no exact shape. I was concentrating to see if there were any red or green airplane lights on it or if it emitted any sound, which it didn&rsquo;t. At one point it was directly over head, still traveling in a west to east course. I was so intrigued by it that I quickly ran downstairs to grab my binoculars, but by the time I got back up on deck it had disappeared completely. Now I have seen satellites and even the space shuttle shortly after sunset with a naked eye, but every time I have seen these they were going east to west because the setting sun below the horizon is reflecting off of the higher altitude craft. But in this situation it was moving west to east and surely I could not see any reflection from the sun off of the dark side of the craft. So I know it was emitting it&rsquo;s own light source and was not a reflection. Also it was not a meteorite since it was gaining in altitude and it had a constant speed across the sky which was somewhat fast for a plane, but slow for a meteorite. I believe in UFO&rsquo;s and many of my family members have seen them around central Pennsylvania over the years. My brother, mother, aunt, and others all have seen them, so I grew up with the belief that they do exist, but not until that night did I actually see something that I can&rsquo;t explain.", "Bright white spherical object moved rapidly from east to west crossing river to the south of our homeSpherical glowing white object was seen moving quickly from east to west crossing Damariscotta River roughly 3 miles south of the town of Damariscotta, Maine.  Speed (very rapid and parallel to horizon) and light (solid bright white) rule out any known aircraft, and the size and direction seem to rule out a meteor.  Altitude is difficult to determine since we are unsure of its distance from us.  Object was viewed through east and south facing windows by two of three people in the room.  Observers were a 31-year-old male and a 72-year-old male.", "Glowing red, round object flying fast over Ponca City, OklahomaMy family and I had just returned from my land out west of town where we launched fireworks until rain started to fall. We were standing by the car talking about the events of the day when I caught a glimpse of an object traveling at a high rate of speed under the cloud cover of a storm system that was moving in. It was bright red, and round in shape. It was traveling from West to East.It had a diameter of about 30ft, and it was not just the color of red, but rather glowed red. I quickly noted the speed and oddness of it and my step father said he was wondering about it too, out of the 4 of us only him and I were facing the best direction to see have seen it. It was so quick that the other two were unable to turn quick enough to catch a glimpse.It was not a light reflected off the clouds, because I saw it in the opening of the cloud cover first then it traveled under the cloud bank as it headed Eastward.There was no sound associated with it and no other affects from it. It did not leave a tail or anything visible behind it. It did not vanish but rather maintained it&apos;s speed and direction and traveled out of sight.A few minute prior to the passing a shuttle had went over head landing at the local airport.

It was a perfectly clear evening. My husband, his 2 brothers and myself were enjoying a quiet night recalling memories around the campfire and watching for shooting stars.I was gazing off to the South West side of the lake and noticed in the sky an orange glowing sphere moving steadily towards the North East. I didn&apos;t know what to think at first. I quickley spoke up and pointed the object out to the others and asked if anyone thought it was an airplane, even though I knew it couldn&apos;t be because there was no sound and no flashing lights at all.We got up from our chairs and followed it as it continued on it&apos;s swift and steady path. At each angle as it passed, the object did not change shape or color. The color resembled the same orange glow of the embers in our camp fire with the exception that the objects color was a steady and non wavering glow. It&apos;s size was considerably larger than any of the many stars that filled the sky and the only sound that we could hear was that of traffic passing on a far off road.After the object disappeared out of sight behind the trees, we returned to the campfire to discuss what we had just witnessed. As we did, 2 airplanes passed over head. We could clearly see the outlines of the wings marked by the multi colored flashing lights and followed by the familiar sound of the airplane&apos;s engine. It was obvious to see that the object that had previously passed by did not match in any way or form what we were now seeing.Our evaluations of the event however, remain split. My husband and his older brother were positive that it must have been some type of military stealth jet aircraft of unknown origin flying high in the atmosphere.My second brother-in-law and I, based on what we had seen, thought that it was too unusual to be any kind of jet. In addition, I have witnessed a stealth jet fly over when they retired the Blackbird SR-71 in 1990. It flew over where I used to work in Valencia, California near Lockheed Aircraft, where it was built. The sound of the stealth jet was not evident as it approached, but after it passed the sound was an unmistakable jet engine&apos;s roar which could be heard even as it flew straight up and out of sight.What I witnessed last evening was in no way a match to that experience. If this was indeed a military aircraft I am totally impressed.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I and my family including a wife and a 03&frac12; year old daughter were going to the country&rsquo;s capital Islamabad by road for vacation holidays. We started our journey from Lahore at about 05:30PM and had to travel a distance of 400 Km to reach the destination. Taking two stopovers in the middle of the journey and approx. 45 Km from the destination, a strange phenomenon occurred during traveling at a speed of 120 Km/h when I suddenly picked up a red blinking light at an altitude of approx. 200ft, moving fast from east to west at a speed of a taking off passenger jet. We were traveling north. Initially I thought that it&rsquo;s an aero plane and for the attraction of my daughter who was sitting behind us on the baby seat, I said to her look there&rsquo;s an aero plane in the skies. But as it approached more closely on the Motorway, it didn&rsquo;t look like an aero plane to me and my wife. It was an orange colored object with a saucer shape and a red blinking light at the bottom and a glowing purple light around its circumference making an arc. I immediately slowed down my vehicle and brought it to 80 Km/h and recorded time on my watch as 09:30PM local time. As it further approached, we observed that it was spinning too fast more than the speed of acceleration. The first sentence my daughter said when she saw it, was &quot;Mom, I have seen it in the Chicken Little movie.&quot; I lowered my window to hear any sound as I was expecting a roaring sound from such a close distance but nothing was heard. We had an eye contact with the object for more than 10 Seconds before it disappeared and we could not find its red blinking light neither the purple arc light any more.", "The lights pulsed identical patterns to each other.I was returning home from work when I noticed two strange lights in the sky. Both lights at first were flashing very rapidly while changing colors. The colors the lights flashed were red, blue, green, and orange (sort of incandescent looking). With each flash the lights became more intensely bright. The first light was south west of Antwerp and the second was north east. The lights flashed in identical patterns, first one then the other.  Suddenly they grew very dim and hard to see, after about 10 Seconds they began to pulse slowly. With each pulse growing more and more intense and then going very dim again.

It had a dark - metallic look to it, and appeared to be extremely high in the atmosphere.  It moved in a perfect straight line across the sky, when it was towards the middle of the horizon, it looped around and made a small , perfect, circular  motion and then continued on its normal flight path.For the elevation it was at, it had to have been far faster than any aircraft, however, it wasn&apos;t so fast that it was a blur.  It cleared the entire horizon in about 60-90 seconds.  There was no blinking or flashing, no sounds, and no exhaust.  The sky was perfectly clear so I could observe it very well.  Also, although it was circular, when it was directly above my view, I notice it did have slightly contoured edges.  Kind of like a more compact, and curved boomerang, however, the &quot;wings&quot; or triangualr shape was very subtle and could only be observed when it was directly overhead.", "Extremely bright light traveling west to east on erratic course.06-08-07  At approximately 12:55 AM on 06-08-07 I parked my car facing north; weather was clear with some clouds on the distant north horizon.  As soon as I shut the door I noticed a bright light moving high in the western sky.  I initially dismissed it as a commercial airplane but the size and speed caught my attention.  It was moving faster than any satellite I have ever seen, and extremely bright.  Light was larger than a star and extremely bright; at least a magnitude -4 or -5. As I stood in the driveway it passed from west to east almost directly overhead.  I have not seen a commercial airplane cruise at such a speed, and it was most definitely not a satellite of any kind.Light was so bright I assumed for a moment it must be a small, quick plane with it&rsquo;s landing lights on or a  helicopter, but as it passed overhead it began to zig and zag erratically, maintaining a fast course to the general east.  There were no sounds of prop or jet engines whatsoever.  It crossed from west to east in roughly 30-45 seconds, beginning to fade at around a minute and finally winking out high on the horizon.  There were no visible secondary beacons or green/red signals of any kind the entire time, not even as it passed to the east--just one single bright light on a shifting course.  Duration could not have been more than 90 seconds. Did anyone else see this around 1:00 AM Friday? I cannot explain what that light was. I am of sound mind and have better than average vision. I work in the aerospace field, and this was not any aircraft I could identify. I was not swaying on my feet; the light was definitely moving in an erratic manner. The magnitude remained constant until it began to pass lower into the eastern horizon. I could not make out any sort of structure at any time; it was too bright.All I can liken it too would be a double-sized Jupiter traveling across the sky.At 1:06AM, I stepped back outside facing east. There were no aircraft I could see or hear, but within seconds a small burst of light caught my attention. I spotted a fast satellite moving south to north, flashing every few seconds. Before I could track that one for long I spotted another flashing satellite moving north to south. Both passed close to each other right overhead.  I have seen flashing satellites before, and are usually about magnitude +2; both of these were emitting far brighter flashes than that, I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it! It was almost more of a strobe. As soon as the first two passed each other I spotted a third, moving roughly SE to NW. All three seemed to be traveling fast for a satellites but I&rsquo;m not an expert.Probably nothing, but I still found it interesting to spot three strange satellites barely 15 minutes after sighting such a strange light in the sky.  I also understand that some satellites will flash reflect light, but still.  The clouds drew over within another 20 minutes.  I stepped out twice to smoke before 2:25 AM, and incredibly each time in a break in the overcast, directly overhead, I spotted another brightly flashing satellite moving south to north, just like the others.

I got up and went to my deck door to see the cat and look up at the storm clouds coming in. There was a really dark huge cloud about 75-80 degrees up from my view. I noticed some silvery white orbs things moving around, and at first I thought they were seagulls. As I watched and looked closer there were no wings. There were about 12-15 of them moving around (even thought there was a storm, there was no wind). I looked at the trees to see if they were moving at all and the leaves were not moving. It was a slow moving storm. But the things I saw were moving as if they were floating around dodging each other. Then a few went into the high dark cloud and then the rest did. I watched for 10 more minutes but nothing ever came out. It&apos;s like they all disappeared into the cloud. It was strange and I didn&apos;t tell my husband who was downstairs painting. I was going to yell for him but he wouldn&apos;t have heard me.

Then I saw the fast moving lights. Three lights were spinning and jumping in the sky not like any other aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen. We were just standing there for alomost 20 min. ans wahtched them.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Absolutely no characteristics of any aircraft I have ever seen, or any description availible of a craft on this site.My girlfriend and I were on our nightly walk around our neighborhood, clear skies, relatively dark, consellations were very visible, very little light pollution (as the majority of the street lights were not working).Typically, there are a few commercial airliners passing over per night, very high and easy to recognize, usually off in the distance enough for the sound of the jet engines to be very faint.We noticed what we thought initially was an aircraft, flying uncharacteristically low. After a moment, we realized that this aircraft was far too low to be a commercial jet, and the sound it was producing was unlike anything I had heard come out of any aircraft previously. If I had to put words to it, one could compare the sound to a very low pitched buzzing, almost as if the sound, whatever it was, was being projected out of an aluminum garbage can. It was audible, however if a person was inside one of the homes, they would not have been woken up by it.The noise, however, was not the definitive characteristic that really threw us off. The shape and the lighting...primarily where the lights were on the body of the aircraft. There were three lights on the bottom, in a straight line. Two lights, very far apart from one another, on the &apos;front&apos; of the craft, vertically aligned, spread far apart from one another; at first they acted as what seemed to be spotlights, however when the object passed overhead, we realized that the lights were projecting 360 degrees, which seemed downright impossible. There were also lights that strobed around the aircraft, not circular, but more on the lines of a diagonal &apos;connect the dots&apos;. The craft was changing course steadily, however the lights did not move from their original place, making it clear in my mind that this aircraft was moving without banking to make a turn, implying there were no rudders, nor jet propultion required to pilot this aircraft.Eventually, visibility of the aircraft was obstructed by trees, allowing us to see the lights only. The aircraft broke off to the right, and left our line of sight.", "I was video taping the clouds cause we might get a storm here and I noticed this flying object and  videotaped it poorly http://www.youI captured it on video here is the link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkwfy9IFThM I also noticed a halo around the sun but that has prolly nothing to do with it although it looked beautifull cause I have never before seen/noticed that.", "Object falling from the sky east of MissoulaI saw a sparkling object fall from the sky east of Missoula. I was facing East out of an office window when I noticed a sparkling, shimmering, and glittering object moving vertically. If you were looking east from downtown Missoula, it would have fallen right down into Hellgate Canyon (although possibly further away). It appeared to be either reflecting sunlight off of different surfaces as it spun and/or tumbled or generating a blinking, irregular light bright enough to be seen in bright daylight. I can&rsquo;t honestly give any more description.", "Brilliant White Orb of Light, Dim Red/Orange Orb seen on edge of electrical stormI was camping near a creek in the desert of Washington, sitting near my small fire facing roughly east, while an intense electrical storm provided a light show to the north-northeast.  With darkness nearing, the storm was slowly drifting my way.I suddenly caught a movement to my left, and looked just as an extremely bright white orb came cruising in from the SW, approaching the storm.  It moved fast, but began to slow down as it approached the storm.  As soon as I thought it had stopped, it moved north along the western edge of the storm IN AN ARC, taking about two or three seconds to cover at least 5 miles.  Then, as soon as it looked like it had stopped, it moved away at an extremely high rate of speed.  It stunned me because of how the brightness was so much more intense than any plane lighting I&rsquo;ve seen before, then stunned me by how it moved.  Wow.  But that wasn&rsquo;t all.While I could still see stars overhead of me (the storm hadn&rsquo;t blocked them out yet), a smaller, dim orange/red orb just appeared beneath the high crest of the creeping cel.  It was like a light had just come on.  The thing was, it just hovered there for a good minute, motionless, maybe a couple thousand feet up and a mile to my NE.  The storm moved over and around it, so I finally lost sight of it.Incidentally, a lot of planes appeared in the area immediately after I lost sight of the last object, and I could later see a chopper flying around shining a spotlight up into the clouds!  Quite an unexpected treat.  The first light in particular, though, made me feel very uncomfortable.  It was only a little closer and lower than the second one, and it didn&rsquo;t move, nor look, like anything I&rsquo;ve seen before.", "Saucer observed about 500 feet up moving into clear blue sky and flying square corners.After 2 morning job interviews in Pittsburgh a light rain had stopped with only clear blue sky and some low white cloud rolls were left not very high over the small hills beside the highway.  While driving south on PA Route 51 just a few miles from downtown Pittsburgh a movement toward the end of one cloud caught my eye.  When I looked up and saw it I figured it was a puff of black smoke and looked back at the road.  Then the movement which I could see out the top of the windshield on the passenger side caught my eye again and when I looked up I witnessed a round disc shaped object slip slowly from the cloud  into clear blue sky.  It was so obvious what it was I laughed and said aloud, &quot;Hey, you lost your cloud cover.&quot;  Judging by the size of a small plane&apos;s wing span of about 30 feet I&apos;d guess that to be the same distance across this craft.  The craft was moving as if following a beam and was moving very slowly  sideways tilted away from me so I was viewing the bottom I&apos;d think.  Shortly after losing the cloud cover and being only around 500 feet up it suddenly went to a higher altitude which would be about twice the height it was at or approximately 1,000 feet. There was no wavering or turning when it went higher, it went up at the same angel it was slanted at and moved in one motion, it did not start out slower, get faster then slow down to a stop.  The speed up to the higher level was at the same more accelerated rate, this movement took the craft away from where I was on the highway. I was now looking at it in the top middle of my windshield and where it stopped at it still had the same slow sideward movement.  It proceeded to go across the highway where I was watching it out of the top left of the windshield.  Then as suddenly as it went to a higher altitude it came back down to about the same level it was at when I first saw it but still had the same slant.  I watched out the driver&apos;s side window and observed it slide right into the end of another cloud.  This craft looked gray wi! th no li ghts or other distinguishing features and never changed its tip or slant and did not turn to go to a higher level or back down.  I think the most obvious thing about this sighting was the perfect lines or beams it was following with no wavering at all.  I received very good grades in Physics and I know even to this day that we do not have any type of propulsion system to make a craft fly like what I observed.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

This time I was not alone as my husband also witness the lights.  The lights appear very large but when we happen to look at them, the lights began to turnoff almost immediately.   When the lights turned off we were unable to see anything in the night sky.  So we looked to the west of US 60 and we saw the same lights hovering over what appeared to be possibly 6 to 8 miles east of US60.  The lights again disappeared very quickly.  We don&apos;t know if this was the same object we had seen only a few seconds to the right of us ( west of US60) or if this was another one.  Anyway the lights disappeared and we could no longer see anything in the sky.  I told my husband that was similiar to what I had witness a few months ago and that i then saw jets flying after or searching for something only a couple of minuets later.   Sure enough when we got home to our drive way, here comes a couple of jets flying as if in pursuit.  The same as the last incident they don&apos;t seem to find what they are looking for.  My suspicion is that these two incidents i have witness is that the object is still in the sky, just hovering in the same spot without the lights on. I don&apos;t know, but what ever it is the object by the distance of each light appears to be as large as a football field in length and that this is the second time I have witness these lights as I am also sure that there has to be more people who must have seen these same lights as we are not the only ones traveling on US 60 on these two nights that this object has appeared in the sky and they are very large.  As a matter of fact I think that a couple days after the october sighting the local news had reported other people sighting lights in Scottsdale, AZ.   It would be interesting to see if reports are made to local news after this report is filed from me.Makes me wonder if this is an actual UFO sighting or military excercises of sorts, since the sightings are not far from Luke Air force Base and an Auxilary base approximatley 7 miles from my house.  The only ? I have is that the jets do not appear to be coming to going to any of these bases, rather appear to be coming from California or Nevada is my guess from the direction i saw them chasing the or pursing the object.Reported by rc from ((numbers deleted))  phnx.qwest.net ((numbers deleted)) on Monday, October 09, 2006 at 3:27AM :  On 10-4-06 driving home from work on US 60 towards Wickenburg around 7:30pm a light got my attention to towards the lake pleasant mountains. At first glimpse I thought it was a fire, but then realized that it was object with it red lights were hovering over the chrysler proving grounds as if in a still position. I could only see a C shape from the angle I was looking at it. It had red lights around the bottom and all i can say is that from seeing the lights and the C shape, my guess is that what I was seeing was round and very large. I was about 10 miles away. The lights turned off one by one very fast and then the i could see no object or anything as it had disappeared?? I could not longer see anything there. As I turned off to go home and got off the car i noticed 2 airforce jets flying over which is not unusual as we live not far from LAFB and LAF auxillary. What caught my attention is that the plans where were turned out to be at least five to seven of them were not flying in any formation as they normally do and were flying extremly faster than what we normally see them out here. They scattered going east as if they were in pursuit. I then suspected that what I had seen is what they might be after, but they were heading the wrong direction. Within a few minuets they turned back around and continued flying around for several hours as if searching for something????

I was looking across the ocean, roughly facing the northwest.  This happened several months ago, so times are only approximate, but at one point between 9:00 and 10:00 PM I noticed a strange orange light in the sky.  I estimate that the object must have been somewhere to the north, based on my position.  It was apparently hovering, making slow movements at different angles.  It rose in the air and apparently moved along the coast.  I observed it for several minutes. I am certain it was not an airplane. It did not move like an airplane or jet of any kind.  The only earthly vehicle I can think of that would have been there at that time would be a Coast Guard helicopter.  I concede that this object may indeed have been that, but the reason I have doubt is that while many Coast Guard helicopters are orange in color, this was a lighter shade of orange, and it was distinctly an orange light or glow, not a painted craft.  In any case, I was at least one-third to one-half of a mile away.  I am only going by a map of the location over which I thought the object might have hovered &ndash; due to perspective, it could have been much further away, over open water.  Given my distance, and due to the fact that this was at night in an area with very little light, I could not have discerned orange paint on a vehicle.  It was hard to tell from my distance, but I think it looked a bit like a funnel or cone pointed down.  The light was not blinking.  I did not see any searchlight either, which might be expected from a Coast Guard helicopter.  I also did not hear any sound coming from that direction, but I concede that I may have been too far away to hear a sound if there was one. After a few minutes, the object seemed to be slowly approaching my direction, which means it was traveling south or southwest.  Not being able to identify it, I began to feel nervous and left the scene immediately.  That is all I know.  It may well have an earthly explanation, but I could not identify it, so I am calling it a UFO.  I am interested in the subject of UFOs, but as far as I can recall, this is the only thing I have seen which might have been one.  However I am fully prepared to accept a mundane explanation.", "Craft sighting related to protection or surveillance of niaki missile base?Viewing UFO panel discussion on Larry King Live July 13, 2007, compelled me to make this report some 39 years after the fact. In August 1968 while working at Boy Scout Camp Benjamin Hawkins, Byron, GA, two fellow scouts and I spotted a craft in the night sky.  The craft produced a sound much like a very high-speed electrical motor, shrill and almost inaudible.  Its shape was that of two bright silver/white saucers placed face to face with a row of clear lights around the center much akin to windows in a commercial jet.  The lights seemed to revolve very rapidly like a gyroscope. The craft hovered approximately 300&rsquo; directly above our heads and seemed to place us in an electrical field, because for a brief time we could not move our bodies.  After a few minutes the craft began to move very slowly to the southwest toward a Niaki Missile base which bordered the camp property.  Just as it reached the tree line it banked slightly and disappeared in a split second, never to be seen again. The Niaki Missile base located in Byron, GA is just a short distance from Robins Air Force Base, Warner Robins, Georgia.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Triangular, quiet, extremely slow-moving craft sighted around Charleston, SC.Today, July 24, 2007, I was reading through articles posted on www.fark.com.  One of the links was to a UK Daily Mail article titled &ldquo;UFO sighting bring town to a standstill&rdquo; (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=470579&amp;in_page_id=1770), about a UFO sighting over Stratford-Upon-Avon.  What immediately struck me in the article was the picture at the top, which made me think &quot;I&apos;ve seen this before.&quot;  A friend and I once witnessed a very similar triangular aircraft flying around the area of Charleston, SC, in summer 2004.  This drove me to look into how many others have seen what I saw.  I figured I&rsquo;d find one or two stories, not the hundreds that can be found that describe the same thing that I remember.I don&apos;t believe in encounters with aliens or anything like that; I think it&apos;s obvious the distances across space are far too great for such a thing to happen.  Despite that, or perhaps because of that, this event had struck me as being very strange, and has left a strong memory of what I would usually dismiss as someone &ldquo;seeing things&rdquo;.I&apos;m not sure the exact month when it happened.  It was during the summer of &apos;04.  A friend and I who were going to school at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command in Goose Creek, SC, decided to go out and get some late night Waffle House.  My friend was doing the driving, as I don&apos;t have a license.  Perhaps if I drove more I&apos;d remember the exact locations better, but I don&apos;t.  You don&rsquo;t remember driving directions well when you don&rsquo;t drive.  Looking at the area&apos;s Waffle House locations on Google Earth, I figure it was most likely the one on Goose Creek Blvd, or perhaps the one on Aviation Rd near the Charleston Airport, which is also very close to the Charleston Air Force Base.Well, we ate our Waffle House.  Afterwards, we figured we had time to waste.  It was probably a Friday or Saturday night or something.  We didn&rsquo;t know the area well as we were only there a short time for the school, and our spare time was usually spent within the city of Charleston.  So, we went exploring.We weren&apos;t more than 5 miles away from one of those two Waffle Houses.  We took a turn onto a long, straight, wide, smooth road.  It seemed to be a strange road.  I know I&apos;d never seen it during the day.  There was a little traffic on the road we came off of, but none on this one.  It was wide, 6 lanes if I remember right.  It looked like it was freshly paved.  The street we came off of was in the open, but this one had the forest close in on both sides, I&apos;d estimate within 10ft of the road.  The trees were tall on both sides, probably 20-30ft, or a little higher.  It would give me the impression of a planted forest since they were all about the same height, but you can&apos;t really tell at night.  We couldn&apos;t see the end of the road in sight, the road in front of us was the only break in the trees, for the whole length of the road.  No other roads turned off that we ever saw.  The street was completely unlit, except for our truck&apos;s headlights.  I don&rsquo;t remember if there were any markings or signs at the intersection that stated the purpose of the road.  There were no signs whatsoever during the length (a couple miles) of the road.  The road turned out to end in a military base, which makes the lack of identification of the road confusing, though it explains it&rsquo;s otherwise spartan appearance.We were driving down the road no more than a minute, when my friend pointed out some lights above the trees to the left.  I can&apos;t remember if there were 3 or 4 lights when we first saw it.  There were definitely 3 white lights (not &apos;glows&apos; as I&apos;ve read some people as seeing) at the 3 points of the triangle.  We slowed down the truck to about 5-10mph so we could get a better look at it.  It quickly became clear that what we were looking at was no commonplace aircraft.I remember trying to determine if I could see a shape of the aircraft, and vaguely thinking I saw a darker (black against the midnight blue sky) shape against the sky.  It had reminded me of a nacho chip, with a light at each of it&rsquo;s points.Next I noticed how slow it seemed to be moving.  It gave me the impression of being low-flying and extremely slow.  (I can&rsquo;t understand how people are claiming that these flying triangles they see are at 1000ft and going 30 knots, etc.  How can you tell from the ground at what height it is, and how large it is?  You can&rsquo;t really tell if it&rsquo;s 170ft wide and 100ft off the ground, or a mile wide and 50 miles off the ground.  At least I couldn&rsquo;t tell in the dark of that night&hellip;)  It made me think of something like a B-2, but if it was only 170ft wide, or however wide they are, then it must have been almost unmoving.  I know few aircraft we have can hover, and a B-2 sure ain&rsquo;t one of them.Then my friend pointed out something that should have been far more obvious &ndash; it was very quiet, perhaps silent.  We couldn&rsquo;t hear any discernible sound over his little Toyota truck.  This later made us think that it could have been a much larger craft higher up, but that seems less likely.  While an extremely large craft could appear to be moving slowly and be silent if it were orbiting the Earth in our upper atmosphere at high speeds, the idea of some Independence Day-sized aircraft remaining undetected by everyone on the planet seems unlikely, not to mention the absurdity of such a design.The next part is still what strikes me as the strangest.  It reminded me of the old stories and movies of a beam of light coming out of a flying saucer to abduct people.  In the center of the craft there was what appeared to be a searchlight, one of those directional beams of light used to illuminate specific parts of a landscape.  I don&rsquo;t remember the light first turning on specifically, and I don&rsquo;t remember it being there when we first saw the craft.  The reason I stated that there were 3 or 4 lights at the start is I figure if it had the searchlight on from the start I would have noticed it a lot quicker, but the clear image planted in my brain is that of the flying triangle with the 3 lights, and the one searchlight in the center.  It was being directed around apparently randomly, like you&rsquo;d see one being used in a prison escape movie to search for an escapee.  The beam could be seen moving quickly and erratically, but smoothly, over the forest, and it occasionally passed over the road we were on, as well, but it never really got close to the truck.  We were still moving slowly down the road with our truck, and the craft was still passing slowly above us.  I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking at that time that whatever piece of magnificent technology that had to be, that they must have known we were there.  But if it did know we were there, it didn&rsquo;t give any indication of it.We kept looking at it in awe as we crept down the road, it eventually being above us and to the left, so that my friend was sticking his head out the driver&rsquo;s side window, and I was looking straight up at the dashboard.  It slowly passed us, or we passed it; whatever happened, it was behind us.  Not much farther down the road we spotted the trees straight ahead that marked the end of the road.  The road split off to the right side, and I think to the left as well.  I remember the right side more clearly for some reason.  There was an empty guardhouse to the right of a small 2-lane road, which had 2 or 3 large yellow-painted pylons staggered along the lanes to keep anyone from flying through.  I&rsquo;d swear I remember a sign to the right side of that road, on the side of the guardhouse, which declared it as an Army something-or-another.  It didn&rsquo;t seem strange to me at the time, but my searching indicates no army bases in the area.  Not even abandoned ones, which would explain the empty guardhouse.Well, we turned the truck around and started heading back, about 30-40 seconds after passing the aircraft.  The aircraft was gone.  Just like that.  We heard no sound that indicated any type of engine speeding up, or any aerodynamic noise, or anything.  It was just gone.We talked about it as we drove back to our Navy base.  We figured it was some sort of experimental military craft.  All the branches of the military were represented in Charleston, except for the Army, as far as we could tell&hellip; except for that sign that I still remember seeing.  We joked that we&rsquo;d probably be assassinated in our sleep by the CIA for seeing something we weren&rsquo;t supposed to.  It still doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me why they would fly such a craft over a populated area we were in.  Admitted the exact place was a thick forest, civilization wasn&rsquo;t very far away.That had remained sitting in the back of my mind &ndash; the time I saw that crazy experimental military aircraft &ndash; until I read that article today.  It didn&rsquo;t make sense to me.  The picture I see there looks just like what I saw, through from a lot farther away, but it&rsquo;s in the UK.  Why would experimental US military aircraft be flown in across the ocean?  They could be participating in it, but that doesn&rsquo;t make sense.  It&rsquo;s the American policy to share our old technologies, not our new ones.  Not to mention, the searchlight?  What was that?  With such advanced technology, it seems like a pretty archaic means of trying to find things at night, and not a very stealthy one.  I don&rsquo;t think we even use beams of light any more for weapons targeting, and we&rsquo;ve got much better ways of communications than using lights.  Makes no sense to me, but it was there.  Oh, and unlike those stories, it was definitely a clear, white light, like the 3 at the corners, except that it was a directed beam as opposed to a simple light.  It definitely wasn&rsquo;t red.I place this event as taking less than four minutes, though I can&apos;t really tell for sure.  It&apos;s not like I was counting the time on my watch.  My best guess was it was 1:30am.Well, that&rsquo;s all the story I have.  I&rsquo;m no UFO expert, or even a military aircraft expert, but I know what I saw wasn&rsquo;t anything the government will admit to having at their disposal.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The objects were appoximately egg-shaped, although it was hard to tell because of their speed, and their brightness was approximately one-third of the moon.  They were about a third of the size of the moon, and the four were in a paralellogram formation, with the long ends facing east to west.  They resembled fighter planes flying in formation because of the relative movement to each other when they traveled, but the accelerated so quickly that no plane could ever go this fast.  The formation was about two times as long as the moon, and about one moon or less wide.  The objects were silent and appeared to be at a very high altitude, yet they accelerated very quickly and uniformly.  As soon as I looked up they began accelerating and in about 2 seconds they went from directly overhead to close to the horizon and out of sight.  A second later the other object to the north followed with the same acceleration and speed.  This other object seemed to take off from kind of a small curve, and then it followed a straight line.  The sky was completely clear so I know these couldn&apos;t have been reflections.  I know what meteors look like and I am certain these were not them.  Also, I have seen some of the fastest planes in the world flying overhead at low altitudes, and they were nowhere near as fast as the objects I saw on this night.  Furthermore, I saw almost exactly the same thing in the same city approximately eight or nine years ago and remember it vividly.  I figured since I saw the same thing again I would report it.", "object  seen the the southern sky it changed shape twice, then traveled off  at a high rate of speed to the south.the object was round,and it changed shape from small to large back to small,there was only one object,the color was a bright yellowe,it was seen in the south east sky for about one min. it changed shape and then faded to dim and travled off in a southern derction at a high rate of speed.", "another silver diskWell this happened in st leonard I looked outside my window and saw a disk silver shape in the distance I know where the airplanes route roughly, where they fly around here but it was going east faded out, then was alot higher and went back west! very slow but when it went up it was over 500 feet and it kinda shined maybe cause of the sun but it went the other way and faded away ! very cool really I wouldnt of seen it but if u pay attention to the skys once in a while you might find some weird things..

We had a snowfall the night before and therefore each of my neighbors on both sides ( left and right) were busy shoveling the snow. I happened to look in the sky and there it was in front of me. Strangely enough, I did not say anything to my neighbors and I was not scared.  I was awed and I just stood there for a while and observed it. It did not have the shape  usually  reported in the newspapers. It was huge and grey. Its was like two rectangles forming an obtuse angle of 130 degrees and below it, there was like a globe with some shadows.  It was standing still in the sky right in front of me. I looked at my neighbors but I didn&rsquo;t want to say anything. I decided to cross the street to have a better look. As soon as I did, I turned around to glance once more at the strange object and it was gone. It was just as if there had never been anything there in the first place. I am not making this up. I never told anyone but family and friends all this time. By the way, when I was a child, my parents did see a UFO. They always told me about it.

I was looking NW when I saw a fireball falling in down to the earth, and it was trailed by a line of what appeared to be smoke- and it was quite long.  In disbelief I did not say anything for a moment, and then I told everyone to look at the sky.  The boy at the park thought maybe it could be a meteorite, I thought maybe an airplane- but none of us were sure and all thought it was pretty eerie.  I am assuming it landed since it was plumating down towards earth, however it was too far away for me to tell if it landed or have a clear perception of its distance.

I live in Quinton which is approx 4 miles from Birmingham city centre. I have had an interest in military aircraft since the age of 14, I&apos;m now 32. I know the signature patterns of aircraft and helicopter strobes  and flight dynamics so the identification of an aircraft I can make instantly.I have been an amateur astronomer for over 10 years and own my own 10&quot; Newtonian telescope with observatory so even the faintest satelite or space anomaly I can identify. To put it short, my eyes are quite well trained and not as easily fooled as the untrained eye.I have had a keen interest for most of my life with Ufology and have read many  if not most of the ufo literature available.I have read many case reports and sightings so I know what  could be easily described as a ufo when a logical explanation is available.   Heres my sighting,   I was standing by my patio door having a cigarette and my wife had just gone in  the bath, whilst smoking I noticed a black  object in the sky approx 3 miles away from  my home, at first it could be confused with  a hawk hovering at close range, but over a heavy populated area at approx 3 miles,  I think not.I continued to watch the object as my mind  was trying to rationalise what I was seeing to an object I could relate to, i couldn&apos;t.The object was black, no lights no sound.It seemed to be oval shaped and on ocassions changed to a triangle shape.Visibility was very good, clear sky with a few rain clouds to the horizon and a few brillant white clouds which were being illuminated by the sun.I watched for an estimated 1 min 30 secs before accepting that this could be a ufo. I have a 9 month old daughter and when she was born we decided to purchase a digital hard drive camcorder to film her growing up. I decided to fetch this knowing  more than likely that when i return the object will have disapeared.I returned with the camera and noticed the object was still there, only now it was on the move.I powered up my camera and started to film the object. The digital display on the camera is approx 3 inches in size so I couldn&apos;t tell if i had the object in view or even in focus, but i continued to film.The object moved over the trees and towards  the horizon and finally disapeared behind a cloud.My ideal reactions would have been to notify the local police of a potential unidentified object within a flight path and even contact air traffic control.Reading as many ufo books as i have i know how important recordable data is, but strange enough i did what most general public do, i thought how strange and just sat down going over in my mind what i had just witnessed.The only plausable thing i did was to email Timothy Good straight away.Although the obect was quite far away, with a trained eye i could just about identify its shapes.

At first I assumed these were large soaring birds such as eagles or vultures, but as they moved across the sky from south to north, I could tell that they were too large and symmetrical to be birds, and that their movement was too even.As they passed by at their closest point to my view (directly to the east from my building) I was able to look at them with binoculars, and could make out what seemed to be 4 lobes, somewhat shaped like a compacted clover shape, which made an overall diamond silhouette with rounded corners.

I wish I remembered a more accurate date, but I did not record any information after it occurred; family and friends basically made me feel embarrassed for telling this story&hellip; which is why I have not formally reported it until now.  I was age 17 at the time of this event. In the summer of 1997, I lived in Kokomo, Indiana, and at about 11:30 PM on a weeknight, I was on my way (driving) to a local Kroger store to see my girlfriend off of work.  I was on S Dixon Rd., heading north as I passed over some train tracks and began approaching a bridge when I noticed a solid bright white light at my 1 or 2-o-clock in the sky.

As I drove towards the object, I pulled up to a house in the residential area that this object was apparently hovering over.  The house was on my right, and so I stuck my head out of the driver&rsquo;s side window and looked over the hood of my car, up above this house&hellip; to see a large black triangular object with 3 bright white lights at each tip, and in the center of the triangle was one large deep red circle (facing downward at the house).  I was fortunate to have been able to observe this object from such a close distance; I remember it being about 150 yards away from me while it hovered over the house.  I was also amazed at how quietly the object hovered, as I remember hearing nothing over the sound of my own car engine. I sat with my head out of the window observing the large triangle for about 1&frac12; minutes before the object began to slowly rise and move in a NW direction, after which it then took off at very high velocity.  As far as I know, I was the only observer of this object, as almost all of the houses in the neighborhood appeared to have their lights off and I saw no other cars on the road.

Portland, OregonOn 6 July 2007, at approximately 4:40 PM (Pacific Daylight Savings Time)in the afternoon, my wife called me on our house phone (I was upstairs, where I was working as usual at our home-based business), using her cell phone, to say that she say a UFO, and that I had better get out there (where she was: on the back deck) pretty quickly or it would probably no longer be there.I thought she was perhaps joking, as less than a minute or so previously, she had called me to ask me to take a look at the good job she had done constructing a makeshift sun-screen to protect the plants on the deck from the excessive heat and sun.  (The temperature was in the mid 80s, relatively hot for this area; the sun was quite bright). I thought her second call might be a way to get me to show up outside quicker than I might do ordinarily.When I was outside, she pointed into the bright, blue sky, where a quite bright &quot;dot&quot; was drifting slowly in the sky, very generally in an S or SE direction.  The &quot;dot&quot; appeared to maintain very generally the same apparent altitude.  Although much sunlight was apparently reflected from it, it was difficult to make out any size for the object, as if it were extremely bright but extremely far away or extremely tiny in spite of its brilliance.The object did not appear to vary noticeably in brightness during the time it was observed, which was perhaps a minute by myself, and an additional (preceding) minute by my wife.  The object showed no signed of rotation, or any sort of jerky motion that one might expect e.g. a helium-filled balloon with some sort of attached string to exhibit while being (presumably) buffeted by the wind.The air in the vicinity of our house at this time as not particularly windy, but also not necessarily totally calm.The angle of the line of sight was about 40 degrees, and certainly no more than 45 degrees; the line of sight was essentially parallel to the slope of the roof on the back (SW) portion of the second storey of our house.  The object was seen to be about one half to one inch about the slope o the roof, as estimated via fingers held out at arm&apos;s length.In discussing the sighting briefly with my wife, I referred to the object as being exceptionally shiny, although she referred to it as being very white, which I would agree with.  The color of the reflection seemed (to me) to possibly be strongly suggestive of a metallic-type reflection.Seeing the object did not result in any immediately-obvious other-worldly sensations; it seemed unusual to be seeing such an object, and there was some degree of discomfiture in not being able to classify it as to the sort of thing it was, or why it was there, or what it was doing, etc.The sky at the time was generally cloud-free, and certainly in the ESE direction toward which we were looking and where the object was seen.The object appeared to drift in the sky, until it was obscured by the upper leaves of some neighboring trees and then no longer visible.The object drifted perhaps two inches (per at-arm-length finger measurement) during the time it was observed; it was not moving particularly quickly at all.  It was most certainly not stationary, however.Attempts to contact a local (or any) FAA Flight Service Station to obtain information regarding the magnitude and direction of the winds aloft were unsuccessful, as all that was apparently readily accessible over the phone was prerecorded weather information for the vicinity, which gave just the surface winds(?), which (if I noted this correctly) were &quot;310&quot; (the heading presumably) at &quot;12&quot; (MPH?) for Portland (Oregon), or at &quot;6&quot; for Troutdale (Oregon).This report was submitted about 6:40 PM, two hours after the incident.", "Golden cigar shaped UFOI was riding my motorcycle to work, just passing the Savannah Golf Club.

After I got the bike stopped I looked back to where it had been but there was nothing there anymore.

Directly across from my balcony is another condo complex, approximately 75-100 feet away.  The two run parallel and there is a long grassy lane that runs between them.

I decided to smoke a cigarette while I was outside, and after several minutes I could see two objects in the distance, which I thought were planes because I could see red and white lights.  I continued to smoke until I noticed that the lights were closer and appeared to be much lower in the sky than I originally thought.  I watched the lights move toward me, to the south, and when the closest one broke the plane of the twilight, the silhouette I observed appeared to be a black sphere shape with 4-5 lights on it.  I did not hear any sound or see any headlights or green lights, and I my adrenaline was pumping as I tried to make sense of what I was seeing.  I live near SFO Airport, so planes are regularly flying overhead.  I then noticed that the second set of lights also appeared to be on a sphere shaped craft and both craft were flying in the same direction at approximately the same altitude.  I watched as both craft appeared to fly in a straight line due south until they passed out of my view. As I lit up another cigarette, I reflected on what had occurred and attempted to logically explain what I had seen.  Not even two minutes later, something else caught my eye further north.  A triangular craft that appeared to be slightly larger than the spheres came into view from behind a tree.  It looked black (but it was difficult to tell with the twilight fading) and it had the same red and white lights, but the white lights seemed to be arranged in a rectangle from my viewpoint.  I didn&rsquo;t notice any sound, although I may have been too distracted to notice.  I watched it head slowly toward the direction of the two spheres flight path.  As it passed out of view, I frantically tried to call friends that lived south of me, but none of them picked up. I genuinely hope that someone else saw this or can explain what I did see, because after talking with my friends, I know that I won&rsquo;t be able to talk to people about this without some kind of corroboration.

The one behind the one that was in the lead was slowly picking up speed. And just as it seemed that they were going to disappear behind the mountain, it was there that the lights just dimmed out and seemed like they were shooting up and to the left a bit before they just vanished.

The flashing red light flew right through the other bright light, but the two smaller ones disappeared into the bright light with the haze around it.  Once the smaller lights disappeared; the flashing red light sped off and then it too disappeared.  Two minutes later a flashing yellow light appeared.  When looking at these lights they formed a triangle in the sky.  The bright light beneath the moon went out and then came back on when an airplane flew near it.

It eventually just gradually faded out till we couldn&apos;t see it anymore. I told the lady that I&apos;d seen objects like that a lot and it was probably a satellite or a weather balloon. No one else commented. Then we all began looking at the Big Dipper and talked about what it is called in other languages. In french it is &quot;L&apos;Ours&quot; (sp?), the Bear, and someone said what the Dipper was called in Spanish. Then the same woman piped up, &quot;Look there it is again, the UFO&quot;.

It then flew over to the next star, and so on until it had connected all the dots as if to show us it knew we had been talking about the Big Dipper. I don&apos;t really remember which stars it flew to and in which configuration but it touched every star on the kite part, then it exited the kite and zipped down the &quot;tail&quot; seemingly increasing velocity, then it faded out as it had done the first time. All five of us were in awe. But no one really spoke about it. There was a guitar there and I began playing guitar and singing, so unfortunately I missed the fleeting reappearance of the object, to which everyone exclaimed &quot;Wow!!!&quot;. No one told me what they saw and I never asked which is another strange thing about this experience. I think it might have been a magnificent flare up, I&apos;m not sure but seemed this object made it&apos;s final exit with a major exclamation. I moved away from Quebec to Maryland weeks after this sighting and have never seen or spoke to any of these people since, but I will go back and find the man I knew at the campfire, who will still be living in Sawyerville. He will definitely remember all this event. He has seen many UFO&apos;s out there since the late sixties, and I believe that because of the telepathic nature this object exhibited, that this man probably had some psychic or spiritual connection to these Beings or Intelligences((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a bright white light (with a slight yellow tint). I thought it was an approaching aircraft with its landing lights on, so we parked and watched it for a while. The light didn&rsquo;t move as expected, instead it just hung in there in the sky so we decided to drive in it&apos;s direction. The light seemed to go from very bright to dim and back again. This wasn&apos;t the normal &apos;twinkle&apos; of a star, it was much slower, and the light was not pulsing in a normal interval. We drove west towards the light. While driving we started thinking that it was Mars, but this thing was too big to be a planet. When we parked, I found a tower with red lights about a mile away to use as a point of reference, and the light we had been tracking was much higher than the top red light of the tower. Over the course of 30 minutes, the white light moved lower and lower (We could not see the light moving, but comparing it to the point of reference, we could tell it had moved). It would get so faint that it would &apos;disappear&apos; from our sight and then seconds later be back at full brightness. We saw a plane go by and when the plane got near the light, the light completely vanished. About 45 seconds later the light was back. By 12:00am, the light was below the lowest light on the tower (there were 4 lights). It seemed like it was getting further away, flying in a West NorthWest direction. All of the sudden, it was gone.

I would estimate my distance at about a half a mile away. I stopped to watch.  There was no sound. Where our house is located is a flight path for the local airport.  So I know that sound always &quot;follows&quot; an airplane. There was no sound ever. Then all of the local dogs in our area started barking. You can hear barking dogs from miles away.As the light started heading north, I kept looking for the light to change in intensity or disappear the way headlights would change on an airplane at different angles.

I saw it/them travel approximately 15 degrees across the sky horizontally.  It/they were approximately 40 degrees above the horizon vertically.  The light intensity was a little less than a full moon, with a softer glow than the moon has on a clear night.I got the impression that the large light was spinning counter-clockwise as it divided in two, like the second circle spun off from the original.  Both smaller circles were the same size.  It/they did not change speed or trajectory during the time I was observing.  After it divided, both smaller circles stayed next to each other horizontally and continued on the same trajectory as the original.In my opinion, it did not behave like a spacecraft.  Except for the splitting, it behaved like a giant &quot;shooting star.&quot;  The dividing process appeared consistent with how a rotating ball of liquid or gas might divide in two.There was lightening activity in the sky earlier in the evening.I observed this in Titusville, Florida (northwest of the Kennedy Space Center on the east coast of central Florida).

At one point a small single engine plane flew over at a much lower altitude than this object.  During the 15 minutes it never appeared to get much lower.

I was driving a back road close to my home when I noticed a bright light just above the tree line to my left.  As the aircraft passed the trees and was in clear view I noticed that the object was triangular in shape.  It had a bright white light on the front and 4 evenly spaced white lights on the back.  The lights did not project a beam like a landing light will often do, and the lights were a clean white versus the yellowish tint associated with an incandescent light.  The aircraft itself must have been black because I could not make out the shape against the dark clouds other than the shape that the lights produced.  I estimate that it was approximately the size of a commuter jet from front to back, but it was definitely not a commuter jet.  It was moving from east to west at approximately 40-50 miles per hour and at an altitude of about 2000 feet at the most.  I did not notice any strobe or other colored lights associated with commercial aircraft.  I also was unable to hear any sound, and I had rolled my window down to see if I could hear anything.  I turned around in a driveway to follow it and see if I could get a better look and by the time I got back on the road it had apparently sped up enough to get out of my sight or had gone into the clouds.

I&apos;m not sure if it was ball lightning or something else. At approximately 11:30pm and after the rain and lightning had passed, I stepped outside on the back porch for a cigarette.  I did not see any lightning at the time or hear any thunder that I recall (but I was not listening for it).  I was facing the north to the back yard and decided to turn around.  Just as I turned to the south, I saw what looked like a comet but larger shoot across the sky.  I can only describe it as a very large comet, white light, with a tail.  It flew under the clouds in the south which would be in the Watertown direction.  Since it was cloudy, the object was low, and quite large (from a distance), I can only estimate that it was not a comet or shooting star.  Stunned (for I&apos;ve never seen anything like it before), I waited to see if anything else would transpire.  Some lightning did issue from the clouds to the south, along with some thunder shortly after, the kind that webs out of the sky toward the ground, but what I had seen a moment before had shot horizontally from west to east, and was a lone object not attached to any such electrical webbing. I brushed this even off as being a first time sighting of &apos;ball lightning&apos;.  This morning I looked it up on the web, and although it is sometimes described as having a tail, I am only coming upon stories of &apos;ball lightning&apos; &quot;hovering&quot; and moving slowly, which is a little confusing to me.  What I saw did not hover or move slowly, nor did it resemble the ball lightning I came upon in a short film on YouTube.  This moved quickly and brightly, like a ball of white fire.

They reappeared a second time about 15 minutes later in the exact same place.  We walked over the dunes to the beach and saw other strange clusters of lights in different locations throughout the sky that were much smaller or distant. The other lights would pulse sometimes in diagonal patterns or seemingly random clusters.  Some seemed to move or dart around while others seemed stationary. A military jet flew over the area then returned to wherever it came from. The orange lights reappeared a third time after 30 to 40 minutes with a very dramatic simultaneous pulse in two very distinct &quot;cigar&quot; shapes comprised of about 6 to 8 lights each.  A seemingly dramatic decrease in the temperature of the onshore breeze (could have been nervous chills) also occurred at roughly the same time.  Just after this final pulse, the activity of the other &quot;satellite&quot; lights increased significantly and then pretty much stopped after about ten minutes. There were a number of people watching on the beach with us, one person actually made a video recording of the event.  He told us that they had witnessed these lights for three nights in a row occurring roughly ten o&apos;clock at night.  They were definitely not running lights on aircraft, weather balloons, flares, optical illusions, fireworks, or anything else that we could think of that could have created these lights.  I personally found the their appearance to be like the phosphorescence of a firefly or jellyfish, and not like the light from a bulb or something burning.  I hope the other people who witnessed this event will also report it.", "Saucer above the Cornelius Pass curvesI was driving to work like any other day on Cornelius Pass Road.  Usually there are other commuters, but this morning the road was strangely empty.  I was talking with my sister on the phone and our connection became static.  I asked if she heard the static, but she replied no.There are two sharp curves on the road and there are some street lights only on this section of road.  As I approached I could see above the normal street lights two very bright spotlights in the sky.  I told my sister about the odd lights and continued to drive up to the curves.As I took the first sharp curve I could see I was beneath a hovering saucer shaped craft.  Other dim colored lights became clear on the underside of the object.  Once I realized what I was seeing, the craft zipped off to the west over the hills, along Columbia River.Once the craft was out of sight the static cleared on my phone.I&rsquo;ve always been interested in the possibility of UFO&rsquo;s, but never thought I would see something so up close and personal.", "Cigar shaped object, whose ends rotated and blinked lights, the ends separated from main object and shot up quickly above the main one.My Boyfriend and I were heading back to my house in the country late one night on a dirt road in 1988. I cannot remember the date exactly, only that it must have been springtime, because of where I lived during that time. As we drove we noticed some strange lights in the sky. I was intrigued and told him to turn around to get a better look. We turned around and headed back the way we came. We drove slowly, and there were 2 other cars on the road. One car was heading in our original direction. It slowed down and then took off quickly. The other car was coming up slowly behind us. We began driving very slowly, looking at the object. It was cigar shaped and had blinking lights. There were colors but not a big difference in color, more like changes in shade. Anyway, the lights were on the ends of the object forming circular rings around each end., appearing like rotating ends. We put the windows down to see if we could hear any sounds, but heard none.Then suddenly, the ends of the object came off and suspended for a second, then shot in an upward direction so fast that it left a light trail. We weren&rsquo;t quite believing what we were seeing but the ends that had come off then began a zigzag like pattern in the sky, traveling very fast. We couldn&rsquo;t believe how fast. We were thinking out loud trying to figure out what type of craft could move that way, but never could think of one.The main object remained stationary, but still had lights blinking. The 2 objects that had split off also had lights blinking. They returned to the main craft after a few minutes. The object remained where it was and we were trying to decide what we would do. Then it appeared to get lower in the sky. I was very excited, but my boyfriend was scared. I was acting like I was high on something and wanted to get closer to it. I was really afraid, but more excited. I don&rsquo;t know , I must have had an adrenaline rush. We had totally forgotten about the car behind us and then noticed they were right behind us and watching too. We motioned for them to come up next to us.They drove up parallel to our car and we started talking about what we were seeing. They were obviously scared and didn&rsquo;t want to wait around for whatever &ldquo;it&rdquo; was to come closer. We did agree that we could not explain what we were seeing. They decided to leave and sped away. It was 2 women, but didn&rsquo;t get any names.We stopped in the road and looked at it, then realized it was moving slowly along the tree line. The road we were traveling on was next to a young  pine grove, with older trees behind it.  It was hard to judge how close we were to the object, but I&rsquo;d estimate within a half mile. The object was moving above the older trees and there didn&rsquo;t seem to be too much distance between it and the tree tops.We didn&rsquo;t say anything to each other for a little while, then I said I wanted to get closer. We sped up along the road to catch up and then realized it seemed to be drifting towards us, purposefully. Well, this definitely sounded alarms and we both decided to get the hell out of there. It was almost like, they had &ldquo;spotted&rdquo; us.We get home and we tell my parents and siblings all about it. We go over everything with them to try and come up with a rational explanation. We never did.Time has passed. I wish I had gotten the names of the other people who saw it. I wish I had pursued more information. I have never been able to come up with anything of this earth that could have done what &ldquo;it&rdquo; did. That feeling has never left me. I married that boyfriend and he has been plagued with &ldquo;night terrors&rdquo;, or so they say. He will wake up all hours of the night screaming, or talking out of his mind about &ldquo;things&rdquo; coming to get him. He has a scar that no one in his family can remember an injury that caused it. We joke about it being where &ldquo;they&rdquo; took him and did experiments. I know it is not funny. I truly believe that we experienced something from beyond our understanding. An interesting thing about that is we moved away from Mississippi in 2004 to the northwest US and he has not had one &ldquo;night terror&rdquo; since we moved.I had 2 other interesting events occur like this in my childhood that I had put away as a trick of the mind, and didn&lsquo;t let myself see it any differently. I took in a lot more of this event than the others.I am a Christian by faith. I believe the Bible, I believe in my salvation. I am not afraid that there is something else out there. Many people believe it is blasphemy to believe that there are &ldquo;others&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t.Who are we to believe that we are the only ones in the universe? That there isn&rsquo;t room for more. I don&rsquo;t know what we saw that day.  I may never know. I do know that, because of my belief in an all powerful God, that ANYTHING is possible.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "A spherical object that moved impossibly fast, flashing light across the noon sky.I was sitting on the beach looking at the Eastern sky.  There was a diverse variety of cloud formations on the horizon and clouds were passing overhead.  The Southeastern sky was clear and blue except for some very shear cirrus clouds to the Northeast.  The conditions were very good: light Southerly winds, low humidity, excellent visibility. I was starting to look Southeast when suddenly a bright light caught my eye.   I thought at first that it was a high flying plane reflecting the noon day sun.  There were several flashes of light that moved in a Northeastern direction in a nearly flat trajectory.  I saw a bright white spherical object traveling at a speed that can only be described as impossibly fast.  It appeared seemingly out of thin air and I was somewhat startled by it. It went from a high speed to slowing down and as it moved across the sky, it looked like it either flew into, or behind the cirrus clouds.  It also had an aura that became more pronounced when it interacted with the high level clouds.  It stopped for moment and then disappeared.  It happened very quickly, but I got a good look at it.  A strange feeling came over me as I realized that I had never seen anything like that before. To further describe: I was sitting at sea level and I was looking skyward 45 to 50 degrees from the Southeast horizon.  It appeared as a bright light that also flashed a few times.  It looked like it was at a very high altitude, which would mean that what I saw had to be of substantial size.  It moved a good distance in what could have been no more than a second or two.  The spherical shape became more apparent when it slowed down, however it was still moving quickly.  When it stopped, it remained stationary momentarily, then it vanished. My wife was with me when this happened.  I tried to point it out to her, but she only got a glimpse of it.  It all happened so quickly, but the image is very clear in my mind.  I have no idea what this was, but I would love to hear an explanation.", "Orange lights in a line appear from right to left as first goes out another to the left lights upIt was about 10:30pm on May 17th, 2007. I was outside on our upstairs deck looking to the West. I noticed a white light about the same size as the planet Venus moving from South to North. The light was as bright as Venus and did not have any other flashing lights around it. From my point of view the light was moving from South to North at a steady pace. After it passed by Venus the light split into two lights, now flashing. They each went away from one another at about 45 degrees. They then disappeared. This lasted about one minute.Approximately 10 minutes later my husband came outside to join me and I told him what I saw.  After waiting a few minutes three orange lights appeared in the Western sky in about the same area, to the left of Venus and just above the treetops. These lights were bright round lights, orange in color and the same size as Venus. They appeared one at a time from right to left. As one would come on to the left the right one would go out. The lights would fade in intensity as if a blowing tree was blocking your view. Then the lights just turned off. This lasted about one minute.  We both noticed after the lights went out there were about 20 to 30 airplanes in the sky circling the area where the lights had been. These airplanes appeared very far away.We waited about 10 to 15 more minutes and saw more orange lights appear in the Western sky just to the left of the previous ones. This time the lights appeared one at a time from right to left, about 3 or 4 in a row. They faded and brightened again and then just before going out a line of 3 smaller lights appeared at a 45-degree angle up from the original lights in this formation. Then they turned off too. This lasted just 30 to 40 seconds.These lights were about the size of a pea from arms length and about an inch apart in the sky. They did not move when illuminated. They did not appear in the exact spot as the times before. These lights were not flares being shot up from neither the ground nor flares shot from an airplane.I am a police officer and I called the station to see if anyone else had reported the lights. I was told that a woman that lives about 20 miles to the Northwest of my home called and reported the orange lights in the sky. From her point of view they were also to the West of her home.", "Multiple &quot;Power Ups&quot; in small area of skyNow this is really starting to get weird for me.  I seem to be seeing more and more of these things.  I had recently reported seeing one on the 17th of July in Cape Breton so of course I seem to be spending more time watching the skies now.I went to a backyard fire in my neighborhood last night and stayed quite late.  At 0300h I stood on my porch just looking up at the sky.  At first I noticed what seemed to be a lot of satellites moving in the same direction one every minute or so and some going back in the same direction.  Then I started looking at the area of sky where they all seemed to be originating or heading to.  It was then I saw several &quot;power ups&quot; as someone else refers to them.  In a span of about 45 minutes I saw at least 6 lights appear from nowhere and become the brightest thing in the sky or as they were traveling become the brightest thing in the sky.  These flare ups lasted no more than about 3 to 5 seconds and then after they went back to looking as though they were just satellites traveling across the night sky.  On two occasions I saw very bright flashes of light that only lasted a fraction of a second but they were bright enough to catch my attention.  All in all between objects which did and did not flare up I saw in total around 20 or so objects moving across the sky in that small area.

I was awake enough to take this in and hear George ask her if she would talk to him after show,....and Voile!!!!!  A light lit up my bedroom.  Since we are atop a hill and far from the road, a mile or more from any house it was not a car.  I was shocked.  Got up to better see out the window, although out my second story window, I am rather with the tree tops.There are hills and hollows here.  I was on one hill looking toward another hill.  And above that hill was what at first I thought was a streaking falling star, the tail of it. This was not the case. It was too wide.  It was angled straight up and down. And no streaks or movement at all.   It hung, a rectangle, above the far hill.  It sparkled like a rhinestone rectangle.  Just hung there sparkling with a perfect perimeter of a rectangle.  Neat as if you had drawn in with a ruler. Bright.  Sparkling. White.  Rectangle.  Fatter than the width of a falling star. It was higher than a house above the far hill. Wanted to bring my husband from another room but afraid it would be gone. It did not diminish in brightness, size.  It did not waver, wiggle.  After about 20 or 30 seconds it vanished.  Instantly.  Was there, one split second it was gone. I called the Ohio State Patrol, the Lisbon Police Offrice, the Columbiana Sherriff&apos;s department.  They all had no reports.Where I saw it was just about where I see the plume of exhaust in the daytime from Shipping Port Nuclear Plant. A few days later, in morning, maybe about 7am or so there was a strange light trail (up from the ground I thought) near that area.

The vitreous fluid sloshed back and forth with the movement of my eyes and the object I saw kept moving in one direction, so I knew it was not the fluid in my eyes.I then screamed out to my wife to see this fast moving object and she ran over but the trees were now blocking my/our view and then clouds were as well.

In fact, our view of the object was blocked because of the numerous trees that surround our area.

We started to throw high passes to each other when I saw a tiny silver object at a high altitude.  I thought nothing of it because at that time there was a U.S. Naval Base located just North of New Iberia and seeing aircraft was a frequent everyday sight for us.  We continued to throw the football to each other and I decided to throw a high pass back to my friend.  We both looked up at the ball and we both became nearly speechless.  There was a huge circular chrome craft with a circular shaped bar going from one side of the craft to the other.  It had a clear glass looking globe in the center.  I told my friend to get his dad, quick.  His dad came out of the house and saw it.  When he came out the craft rose in altitude until it was out of sight.  It took it maybe a second or two to do this.  The strange thing about it was it made no noise at all.  His dad who was a Naval officer in World War 2 went inside immediately and called the Naval Base.  He spoke to the radar personnel and asked them if they had seen anything strange on their radar and he gave them the approximate time we saw this thing.  They told him it was probably just a weather balloon.  He then told them about his Naval career and told them no weather balloon could have traveled that fast.Every time I go back home and run into my friend I ask him if he remembers what we saw and he says yes.  I asked him to draw it to make sure it was what I remembered what it looked like and his sketch matched what I saw.  I don&apos;t tell anyone about this anymore because they don&apos;t believe it and think I am crazy.  Some say they have seen strange lights at night but my buddy and I saw this craft on a cloudless day.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was driving across the river to The Dalles, OR. and I noticed it was getting brighter. Getting out of the car back home about 15 minutes later I saw the object begin moving east on a straight course. It was solid white with no blinking lights like planes have.  In fact, there was a jet (it did have blinking lights) in the same area going in the opposite direction and by comparison the object was moving much faster.

We were able to spot these through a scope to see that these objects were flashing three bright colors; Red, yellow, and blue flashed in what seemed random order.To get a closer look, we headed up a nearby butte. When arriving at the top of the butte, we quickly noticed there were at least five of these combination lights. They appeared to be situated at all different heights in the sky and at different ranges. Focusing on the largest/closest object, we could see indeed that these lights had three main colors that revolved very brightly.

I had photographed a cigar shaped UFO about two week prior following repeated helicopter flyovers and the sighting of a fast moving disc, which was submitted to your site as well as to MUFON.   This was the same sort of feeling...a powerful sense of presence.    I grabbed my Sony DSC-H5 digital SLR with 2x telephoto and 10x internal optical zoom.   I set the internal zoom to approx. 3.5x and to the automatic setting.   I began to shoot a series of bursts at treetop level...the camera will shoot anywhere from 3 to 5 images in quick succession, usually less than a second apart.   One of the final series of &apos;bursts&apos; captured a V-shaped formation of at least nine objects in the second of five shots.   I did not see anything when I shot the images.   I was making sure to not photograph birds as I first framed the shot and focused through the viewscreen and then visually scanned the skies before hitting the shutter button.   There were no birds in sight.   The fourth image also showed an object sittng just above a branch.   I later put together a rough animated gif (which is being sent to you) in the hopes that I can be told that these are bugs that fly in formation and then do zig zagging maneuvers.Speaking of maneuvers...the Blue Angels were in SE Michigan that evening, temporarily based at Willow Run Airport approx. 30 miles to the east of my location.   They did a flyover at the start of the Detroit Tigers-Cleveland Indians game at Comerica Park in Detroit.   I did not hear any aircraft when shooting these images...This series of photos as well as the previous cigar shaped object photographed have occurred in the skies which seem to be a main air corridor for large commercial and cargo jets flying eastward out of Chicago.

It seemed to rise and fall thousands of feet with relative ease(I used clouds as a background marker to help determine altitude). I do not think it was an airplane. Airplanes normally have flashing lights turned on at night. This one was either not an airplane, or the pilot received a very nasty letter from the FAA the next week. It eventually faded from view.

The way this object began to move around was definitely not like any jet, acrobatic plane (I&rsquo;ve been to many air shows), helicopter or anything I&rsquo;ve seen. It gyrated, back and forth, sort of wobbling, then scooped down like it was going to crash, shot back up again vertically, hovered a bit, gyrated AGAIN - even moving backwards, and then swooshed down again and so forth.

I kept a keen eye on the light, and at one point it stopped, and then it moved very quickly east at a more rapid speed than it had been traveling, almost like it had been shot out of a cannon. Then it reversed direction and traveled back to where it had been before. This erratic movement made me curious as to what I was watching. As I moved along the road through woods and farmland, up and down and around curves, I tried to keep up with the object, and as I rounded a turn and made for the straightaway ahead, the object approached us on the right in a slow and deliberate manner. I crossed through an intersection and came to a complete stop to watch the object in the sky cross over us from right to left about thirty to fifty feet above my car. Our car windows were rolled down, and there was no sound at all. The aircraft appeared to be egg-shaped or round with an unorganized array of lights, mostly amber-orange, red, and white covering the outside. It appeared to be from fifty to 100 feet high.  A large beam of light was directed down from the bottom of the craft like a search light, and it was whipping back and forth as if it was searching the stand of trees as it flew over.

I was looking from a 6th story balcony from  the marriott ocean club in kaanapali, maui, and I was looking at this one colorful star ( it had red around the white dim lite and a greenish coming from the sides )  at the very top of the one mt.and the object  that i thought was a brite star or planet maybe -  started to move,it headed  down the mt. parallel to the mt.  where there are no roads, it came straight down slowly and then stopped and emitted a bright white lite ( not like a lite house - it wasnt a beam and didnt lite up an area around it that  I could see around it- as i was maybe a few miles (1-2) at most away from the base of the mountain)  but the lite was so big it glowed  a brite lite with a red fringe on it and green like sticks coming out of the sides in lites and then the bight lite went out and then it did the same thing three or four times in one spot as it stayed in one spot as it did that ( that was quite a time to be in one place for a plane or helicopter and the lite was really bright from such a distance and quite large for that distnace but the lite came from the middle of the object and didnt move around or anything it just glowed , but i could look at it but turned away to make sure of what i was seeing as i looked back at it  went out and then on again more than once , then it moved further straight down the mt. not glowing anymore but still you could see the main colors of it- it stopped and i wasnt sure where it was on the mt exactly but in the morning i could see it was most likely just above or around the high tension wires that are along the side of the mt. sideways . there arent any houses there and no road that leads up the mt. and there is a golf course below  the high tension wires but i dont k! now how far away the object was from the wires or the golf course . so it had to be somewhere abover the golf course and above where the wires are. It was dark on the mt but gets more lit up closer to the golf course and there is some constuction of a new marriott to the left side of the golf course but at 8pm it is highly unlikely anyone was working from 8pm on that nite. I did see some cars coming along a road up there near the construction but again dont know the distance from where i saw the object finally stop and the golf course or the road the cars were on. I DO know that from where the object started from on top of the mt there are no roads that lead down from the top of the mt. where this object came from . I found it amazing no one would notice such a bright lite coming off the mt. so high up and i was amazed that it was so bright when it was glowing on and off but it was high up the mt at that time but it was not a helicopter as they dont have such big lites on them and I wouldnt  think they fly after 8pm that high on the mt in the dark  and what ever it was certainly didnt move like a plane or helicopter. This object stopped in one place for quite a while maybe five minutes as it gave out the glowing  bright lite on and then went black and then on again and then off a few times. what would do that ?? i have no explanation of what it was , but what looked like a star at first way at the top of the mt. or  above the mt. moved straight down and then  what stops and glows on and off and then moves down and stops by high tension wires????. well,at that point  we had been up watching this for about an hour and when it finally just stopped and stayed in one spot somewhere above those high tension wires i watched as i had gone into my bed  with the shades of the balcony pulled all the way open so we could see it from our beds , my aunt was with me the whole time and we fell asleep staring at it as it just stayed in that last place for twenty minutes or more . a ufo ? i am not one to speculate and took all ki! nds of p erspectives of the mt the next morning and there is no road from the top of the mt. where it started from to where it first stopped and although they  are building houses much further down the mt near the others ,this object did not go to the point of where the lites were so we could see it better . I know it was something unusual and was told by the maui news who i called the next day (to find out if anyone else saw this) that on and off people do call aobut lites in Maui. Maui is a vortex by the way. I was also told by someone at the observatories that expeditions on foot have been made up the west maui mts and they found a pyramid of what they think is of alien origin some where up there - the mts are about 7000 ft high i think -?? does anyone know about that pyramid they found or was that a secret ???? I am not a person who imagines things or makes more out of something than what it is but this was not anything like I have ever seen before and I  kept trying to find something that it could be other than an unidentified flying object. I could just kick my self for not getting my camera but it was so unusual I couldnt stop watching it and getting your camera isn&apos;t something you just think of until afterwards.((NUFORC Note:  Venus??

I kept watching because it appeared to be blinking.  As my eyes adjusted to the darkness I realized that the light from the apparent star was shining faintly across the lake.  It flickered blue, white and sometimes a faint red. As my friend and I watched the light it started moving in complete random directions at a very fast speed.  It would bounce up and down, then shoot left and right with no apparent pattern.  It stayed in the same general area of the sky.  The speed and ability to stop without slowing down was not earth-like.As my eyes adjusted more I saw what appeared to be a faint smoke trail behind the light.  I could see the frantic random path of the light by the trail it was leaving.  My friend and I watched this light for about 45 minutes until we decided to go back to the car.  As we turned around to walk away from the water we saw an even brighter light in the exact opposite side of the sky.  It was approx. the same height as the other light, but this was a solid white colored light, like a bright star, and was doing the same motions as the other light.  It almost seemed like they were playing a game with each other, it was incredible.  This was the first UFO sighting I have ever had.

The description of the event and the responses to follow-up questions were consistent and articulate. The witness is cautious in drawing conclusions. The witness also has been employed in the past by agencies where expertise and integrity would be required. The witness expressed reasonable concern about reporting this event due to professional standing, but believed what was observed was so far out of the ordinary it needed to be compared to other reports.TIME/DATE:  April 16, 2007 at 2130 hours (Pacific Daylight Saving Time). (Sunset occurred at 1903 hours according to the Naval Observatory Table.)  LOCATION: My house is about 70 ft above sea level and I overlook the Fidalgo Bay Marina. I live in Anacortes, Washington and my house is on top of a hill looking south towards Whidbey NAS. Whidbey NAS is approximately 6 miles straight line from my house and is SSE. My view towards the south is mostly unobstructed but there area few trees that block 20% of the view.METHOD OF OBSERVATION: Miyauchi 77x30 astronomical binoculars. The optics have excellent color correction and are high quality. They were mounted on a tripod during this event.DIRECTION OF OBSERVATION:  I saw some aircraft lights departing the Whidbey NAS so I pointed my binoculars south to watch the aircraft. The NAS is approximately 6 miles from my house and is SSE from my point of observation.OBJECT: It had a very large and very bright red light that pulsated on and off slowly which is very different from an aircraft red rotating beacon or red strobe anti-collision light. The red light was on top of a dimmer but large white light that was separated by some structure. The object was stationary and hovering and was absolutely still. I thought it might be a military helicopter but there where no red or green navigation lights.SIZE / DISTANCE: Witness could not estimate distance as I don&apos;t know the size of the object. (Rationale: Exact shape could not be discerned and thus, could not be estimated in comparison to known aircraft.) This also relates to one of my follow-up questions about whether or not the object was in restricted air space. The witness reports, &quot;I am not sure if the object was in fact in restricted airspace as I am was not able to determine the distance of the object.&rdquo;&quot; DURATION: Witness observed the object for a few minutes.OBJECT FLIGHT MANEUEVERS: &quot;When I first spotted the object it appeared to be south and west from the NAS but. It slowly started moving in an east direction towards the NAS. But it was moving in a weird wave oscillation motion. It moved a few degrees to the left or east and then stopped. Then it sat motionless for maybe 30 seconds and then shot straight up. I can only guess that the altitude was very low when I first spotted it and was below 1000 feet. When it shot up it moved extremely fast and stopped. It could have covered a thousand feet in a second. But then it accelerated at an unbelievable rate to the east and covered several miles in 2 or 3 seconds and then stopped dead. It sat motionless again for a few seconds and then slowly moved off to the east and disappeared from sight.&quot;POSSIBLY RELATED RESPONSE: As the object slowly moved off, a fast moving aircraft depart the NAS moving west and then turned sharply left to the south, climbed to 1500 to 2000 feet and appeared to accelerate to the south towards where the object had disappeared from my view. I lost sight of that aircraft as well.  The aircraft may not have had anything to do with the object but thought it was strange.Submitted by: James E Clarkson State Section Director Mutual UFO Network Olympia, WA olymufon@comcast.net((NUFORC Note:  We share our sincere gratitude to James E.

I was in sitting in the back seat, my best friend was sitting in front of me and her husband was driving.  We were driving about 65 mph, when we saw bright lights hovering in the sky up ahead to our right, My friends Husband slowed way down as we approached the object finally coming to a stop.  We stopped the car and we were adjacent to the &quot;UFO&quot;, first I was stuck by the size of it, as this thing was about football field sized in width and length. Then I was struck by the absence of any sound, I mean this thing was absolutely silent, also, the object was hovering, and it was only about 100 -150 feet in the air. The air-craft was black or dark in color, with three very large, bright white lights located at each of the triangle points, and there were several smaller more dim lights on each side, also there was a large red light in the center wich was casting a red glow to the ground directly beneath the craft.We sat there observing this air-craft for a couple of minutes, when my friends husband said he was going to get out and go get a closer look, my friend and I immediately protested telling him that we had seen enough and begged him to please get us out of there.  Then the thing started moving further away from us slowly to the norththen in what seemed like an instant it was about 1/2 a mile away and had gaind alot of altitude. We drove on to our friends house wich was only a few more minutes away, as we drove I continued to watch the thing in the sky, and even though it was 1/2 mile away or more it was now west bound and adjacent to us. We arrived at our friends house only to find that no one was home so, we left. My girlfriend and I asked her husband to take the main street home, as the continued presence of the &quot;UFO&quot;, was making us very nervous.We left heading north first then we turned onto the highway heading east bound, once we were heading east, we could see the &quot;UFO&quot; then futher north now but trailing behind us heading northeast. As we rounded the last bend right before you enter the city limits we lost sight of the triangle shaped &quot;UFO&quot;.Over the years my friends and I have discussed the encounter we had with the &quot;UFO&quot;, we are not really convinced that this was anything extraterrestrial. Since we are not far from March Air Force Base, the possibility of the air-craft being some kind of new technology the armed forces have is very real. On the other hand, an air-craft that size being able to hover at such a low altitude without any sound, nor causing any kind of, (for lack of a better term) &quot;wind&quot;,  seems to be impossible.  Out of all the people I have spoken to about our sighting I have only found two other people who had seen the same thing in this area.

Today I watched another Program on TV stating sightings of this same &quot;UFO&quot; all over the world, and so I thought I should also share my experience as well.

I got a very good look at it, as it appeared to be extremely close.   It was a bright metallic white/silver color.  It looked like a quarter or half-dollar stretched out at arm&rsquo;s length to the sky.  The object was tilted and slowly continued to tilt until it looked like a grey sliver in the sky (like looking at the edge of a quarter against the sky).

From my limited research it appears I could have witnessed the International Space Station (haven&apos;t verified it could bee seen from my location at that time)pass over head which I may have but that doesn&rsquo;t explain the other 8+ objects I saw and they all kind of looked the same with the exception of one shooting star like object. The first sighting I saw one traveling from my north towards the east horizon followed closely by a similar object trailing a few seconds slightly off the path of the first object. The rest seemed to be traveling roughly in the opposite direction, each traveling from horizon to horizon in a matter of minutes and some appeared to be moving in a less than perfect straight line. During all this I witnessed numerous shooting stars as one would expect however one was unlike any I have ever seen before, much brighter and much slower with a long white tail similar to those I&rsquo;ve seen on pictures of comets. I must have watched it for about 15+ seconds when it suddenly disappeared low on my horizon.", "Orange Glowing Unidentified objects over the Gulf seen by 4 different people at once.My Husband first noticed a orange looking circular shape appear over the ocean. He pointed it out to the rest of us thinking at first that it could be some sort of spotlight from a helicopter or plane. Within a minute or two the light suddenly dissapeared and reappeared in seconds above the coast line to the right of it&apos;s original location. This flashing from left to right went on for approx. 5 or more minutes. There was no sound, no flashes, no type of trail as though from any form or flare or fired round. The lights stopped for a couple of minutes and then reappeared more extravagent. I personally witnessed the light appear over the ocean and then another orb seemed to stretch out of the original. The cloned orange orb moved faster than light to the far right and then in a quick spinning type motion the light stretched and lines appeared in it. Those went away and then suddenly 4 different ones appeared with the last one to remain being in the same spot as the one that had spun. That one two spun and they all vanished. This lasted from the time we noticed it for about 34 minutes central time. There were no planes, no helicopters, no jets, etc. and no sound at all. I never believed in anything and am still not sure of what it could have been except that of a UFO considering the fact that we can not identify it. The beach was full of crab hunters, so others who may not have been focused upon the beach could have witnessed this as well. We did observe these through bonoculars, however by the time we thought to grab a camera the lights stopped. I guess our word is all we have though the lights stayed long enough to get plenty of pictures, I think we were all more stunned than anything.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  We do not know what they saw.

The light visible with the naked eye appeared redish or green or orange at points. We tried to focus on the object from the telescope and it appeared to have a darkish center. I went and got my camera, a Canon 30D with an attached 70-200mm lens. I took some photos of the object and some of a bright star to compare. The photos certainly didn&apos;t match. I caught in photos the object changing shades of color, red, orange, green were three colors I captured. The object appeared to be disc like. I still couldn&apos;t get too close with that lens so I added an extender to the lens making it 400mm. I saw the object as cigar shaped lights, I thought it was camera shake, so I took pictures of a star again to compare, the star picture was circular this was not. I appeared the object was possibly facing sideways sometimes and other times the bottom or top of the object appeared visible. I couldn&apos;t myself beleive what I was seeing I would certainly be interested in an explanation. What led me to write here was that I saw a news report of a U.F.O. in London that was spotted by an airline pilot from 40-miles out, the pilot concluded the object was a mile wide. the shape of what I saw seems to be comparable so I thought I&apos;d share the sighting. The object was still visible when I came in to write this, I took well over 200 photos of the object.", "I think one satalite moving right than one moving left 15 minutes laterIt was 4th of July at a backyard party saw a light in the sky moving right.

I work in Oakbrook Terrace, IL in the only tall building around, Oakbrook Terrace Tower.  My office is on the 15th floor and faces NE. I was looking out the window at a more northerly angle, watching planes making their approach to O&rsquo;Hare when I noticed a dark gray cloud, for the lack of a better word, hovering near the airport.  I say &quot;cloud&quot; because the edges did not seem well defined.  From my vantage point, I would estimate that the &quot;cloud&quot; was about a quarter to half mile south of the airport, at approximately 500 ft off the ground.  The &quot;cloud&quot; was  about 150-200 ft in length and 50 ft in height.  I thought it was a strange cloud at first, but watched because it was so odd looking and just a little out of place.  There were high level clouds that day but nothing anywhere near as low.  After a minute, another identical cloud approached the first from the north and hovered at the same height about 100 feet away.  The first cloud then slowly moved off to the north, followed by the second cloud about 15 seconds later.

I was outside facing the west when I saw an object move across the sky from south to north. It is impossible to judge the size of this object because I didn&rsquo;t have a frame of reference for depth of field. It did give me a feeling of impossibly large however. It was also traveling at a speed that would be impossibly fast as far as what aircraft known to me would be able to travel. It was oval in shape on the horizontal and had no noticeable trail behind it nor tail of any kind. It was very bright blue/indigo in color with a slight fringe of a lighter almost cream color on its perimeter and was obviously emitting it&rsquo;s own light and was not a reflection of any kind. As it passed rather low in the western sky from my observation point in southern New Mexico it seemed to have a path that followed the curvature of the earth and not rising in altitude nor was it falling like a meteor might be expected to do when entering the earths atmosphere. As it left my field of view then it appeared to be traveling at about 5 to 15 points north. I am not a UFO enthusiast and have no particular beliefs for or against UFOs.

Late at night around 11 PM, I was gazing up at the sky and an odd vertical, dark orange/red light was in the sky. It looked like 3-5 small vertical circles stacked on top of each other. It was very high up in the sky, so I assumed it was a comet or something of that sort. I pointed it out and told my five friends to look at it. As they looked up at it, the single vertical line split into 2 vertical lines and started descending down to the earth. It still appeared very high in the sky at this point. About 15-25 seconds after the single line diverged into 2 lines, it had diverged again into 4 vertical lines. At this point it was very close to ground level. I&apos;m guessing it was 2-3 miles away from where we were looking at it. It was very dark so it is hard to judge the distance it actually was but it was not far away at all. When it had finally appeared at ground level, there were 2 horizontal rows of lights with 4 lights in each row. The light wasn&apos;t nearly as intense now as it was when I had first mistaken it for a comet in the sky, but the light formation clearly made the shape of a saucer and at this point we had no doubt it was a UFO. About 10 seconds after it had fully descended and the 2 rows of lights had appeared, the outermost two vertical rows of lights faded away and immediately following after the center two vertical row of lights faded away. We were silent the whole time we watched this thing descend down onto the earth but after the lights had completely faded, we all confirmed that it was a UFO we had all just witnessed. The grandson of the owner of the property soon told us that his grandparents had witnessed UFOs before on the property (I think he said they saw one about 50 years ago) and that his grandfather had actually coined the city of Earlville&apos;s motto as &quot;The Center of the Universe&quot;.", "tree large lights in a triangle formation doing things I havent seen helicopters doThere were 3 things I thought at first were stars but then I notist they were in a trianguler formation, they started rotating I look away to get some one one is gone and the others folowed((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was much bigger than any helium balloons given at parties.  It appeared to be 4 circles bound together flashing green and sliver lights individually.  I ran into the house to get my glasses and my camera.  It continued a slow ascent away from us to the SE direction.  It would flicker from an almost imperceptible light until it flared up again like the light a star would give after dark.  A passing personal jet flew underneath it.

So at the appropriate time we went out side to view this spectacle and what we saw was a little different than anticipated.  We saw two bright lights much higher in the sky than anticipated, moving one behind the other at a fast pace.

Adams with my business partner.  After the conference, most of the attendees joined up in the field to sky watch.  Mt. Adams is well known for its paranormal activities.While we waiting for lights to start firing up on the mountain, as it has done in the past, we noticed a glowing globe setting low in the western sky above the trees.  I had a spotting scope and my partner started to track it. It was large, yellowish/white, globular and undulated with millions of teeny lights inside.  It moved bout, reminiscent of a jelly fish or an amoeba.  A woman sitting next to us said it had been there the night before too and stayed for about 2 hours then went down behind the trees and disappeared.We continued to observe this object until it was out of view.  It became apparent to us just at sunset and stayed visible until around 11 pm.It was orb-shaped, brilliant, and large and were amazed to see it moving, undulating, turning upside down, right, left.  It was yellowish-white and seemed to change color. On close inspection, it looked like an amoeba or jellyfish with electrical impulses firing off inside.  We saw geometric designs inside lit up like a chandelier.  This thing was incredibly beautiful and graceful, like it was alive.  We were in awe.  We put a video of it up on YouTube.com under &quot;Mysterious Skies&quot; if you would like to see it.Before it went down behind the tree, it looked like &apos;stuff&apos; coming out of it -- lights. There were two other very small bright objects near it - one at 3 o&apos;clock and another at 11 o&apos;clock.  We noticed that they looked exactly like the big one, only much smaller. We also have stills of this object.There was what looked to be an opening in the center which moved around almost like an eyeball, however, the center opening appeared to be square on the outside but round on the inside.  It almost looked like it was looking at us!  Both my business partner and I are Metaphysical Ministers.  We work privately in the paranormal field.  Neither of us has ever seen anything like this before.Later that morning, around 3 or 4 am, we were visited in our motor home by a brilliant, tiny white light.  A flash woke me up.  I thought someone had a camera outside the window and took my picture.  I looked out the window and didn&apos;t see or hear anybody, although I did notice that lights were going off on the mountain like crazy.  When I laid back down, I saw a brilliant white light on the ceiling.  It moved three times before I tried to wake up  my partner.  When I called her to wake her up, it disappeared.  The light did not give off any negativity, I did not feel fear or afraid of it.  I believe It was a light being, as curious as we are and it came to visit.  First contact.

It was at this Time that some strange lights appeared in the north east sky. The lights were a golden orange color and very bright. The first light appeared and steadily got brighter, and then it just went out. Immediately after, the next light came on just to the left of where the 1st one  was. It did the same thing as the 1st. When the 2 nd  light went out the 3rd came on just to the left of it until it reached its brightest point and it went out. The timing of the 3 lights were in perfect sequence, one  would appear dim then brighten and go out, then the next light came on brightened and went out, and then the third did the same.  The whole event took maybe 5- 10 seconds. The lights made NO Noise. I could not tell if the lights were separate craft flying in a tight formation, or if the lights were coming on and going off along the side of a single craft. The lights were not far above the horizon and in the airspace between Fostoria Mi. and Clifford Mi. I knew that the lights were not normal air traffic so I continued to watch the sky. I saw commercial air traffic above my home (Flint/Saginaw Airports). But at 10:50 pm (30 minutes after sighting) off to the north west I could see 2 aircraft flying in obvious formation heading right toward my home. As they approached, you could tell it was military fighter jets. When the fighters were getting very close to the area of the sighting the turned off the blinking lights and even kicked in afterburners. The fighters were flying at a pretty low altitude ( about 1/3 as high as commercial flights) and you could see the bright white afterburner flames. We do not get much military air traffic in the area. But when we do, they are never that low  and never have the afterburner flames shooting out.The ones this night were low, fast and loud enough to rattle the deck I was standing on. These fighters passed just between my home and where I had seen the strange lights. I am not sure what the golden orange lights in the sky were, but I know that the military flying by was a direct result of the sighting. I am a 41 year old male. I manage an office, and have a wife and 2 children. I know what various aircraft look like and spend a lot of time sky watching. I know what satellites look like as the move across the sky.

Upon later inspection (i was in the shower) i noticed that i had a new scar of a triad of dots in the shape of a triangle in my armpit the whole event has been surpressed in my memory until recently i started to have dreams about the things that may have happened to me during those two hours. among those memories or dreams is distinctly tall and petite figures/sillouettes standing all around me in a bright and cold room. this is the first ive ever spoken this to anyone and I am a very skeptical person by nature but what happened that night is beyond anything that I have seen in this world.", "**Constant light moving in zig-zag pattern...faded away***One night in July, my girlfriend and I were looking at the stars outside of my house.

And there was no doubt in my mind that it was an alien craft of some sort. It moved in a zig-zag pattern and as it was moving, the light suddenly faded away.

I brought myself closer to the window, and my two friends neared also. The star was moving. At first it looked like a meteorite or shooting star, but they are both short-lived in the atmosphere but this light stayed longer. It started to move left slowly, then it sped up, then it stopped.

I was outside looking east at the Manette Bridge and the Port Washington Narrows in Bremerton, Washington,  when suddenly I noticed a small blue light traveling east towards Seattle. The light resembled the light of a high flying aircraft, but it moved across the sky at an incredible speed, and disappeared over the horizon within a couple of seconds. There were no trails behind it, as one would expect shooting star or fireball to have. Instead the light remained constant as it skimmed across the sky. Its flight path was not straight, as it glided quickly across the sky, but rather it made a few slight curving maneuvers, moving like a hockey puck over uneven ice. The whole incident was quickly over. There was no sound accompanying the object. I felt an overwhelming sense of &ldquo;Wow&rdquo; after seeing it. Over the years I&rsquo;ve seen comets, shooting stars, fireballs, falling space debris as well as all matter of aircraft.

What sun there was peeking through the clouds had obviously reflected off of this UFO. I thought it was a huge blimp at first however, it was completely covered with white coulds and as it travelled slowly west it changed its shape, expanded and disappeared into the surrounding clouds.

The shuttle was set to land at 12:49pm at Edward&rsquo;s Airforce Base, northeast of our location in Torrance, California.  We trained our eyes to the north in hopes of catching a glimpse of the shuttle (however improbable that might have been).  At 12:45 we hadn&rsquo;t heard the boom so we went into the restaurant and turned on CNN.  The shuttle had yet to land so we went back outside.  When we looked to the north we saw what appeared to be 3 very bright lights following a dark object.  We assumed that we were looking at escort planes following the shuttle.  For about 2 minutes the lights followed the dark object in a triangle formation.  Suddenly 3 more lights appeared.  Several seconds later 3 more lights appeared and so on.  At one point there were about 15 very bright lights in the sky.  Two other people walked over and watched in amazement as these lights moved.  Most of them were moving from north to south but some appeared to alter their course, moving east and west.  After several minutes all but 3 lights disappeared, as did the dark object.  One light stayed fixed in the same position while two others passed overhead (at what appeared to be a very high altitude).  We thought that maybe something terrible had happened to the shuttle and we were looking at pieces of debris. We rushed back inside to see that the shuttle had safely landed.  When we went back outside the lights were gone. Possible Explanations:  1) The lights could have been shiny balloons.  However:  -Some of the lights changed direction moving west and east.  Most were moving southeast. -It was a sunny day and these objects were very bright in the sky.  The two that passed overhead were still bright as they passed near the sun. -Some appeared to be moving in a triangle formation.  They split apart then came back together. -They did not appear to be rising nor losing their intensity over time. -The lights did not flicker like balloons would as they rotate in the sky. 2) The lights could have been airplanes. However:  -They were all the same size the whole time we observed them.  Even the lights that went overhead appeared to be the same size as the ones further away. -They did not move like airplanes.  One stayed completely stationary throughout the 10-15 minutes we watched them.  Some moved quickly, others slowly. -Two groups of 3 appeared and disappeared in unison. -They were not reflective like airplanes.  Other planes going to and from LAX flew by and would only reflect light for several seconds at a time.  The two strange lights that passed between us and the sun stayed illuminated the whole time.  All of them were much brighter than you would expect from normal airplane reflections. 3) It could have been debris/fuel/waste from the shuttle.  However:  -The lights did not fade over time like you would expect to see from debris burning up. -They did not leave a trail. -Some lights were moving quickly while the single one remained stationary.  Some also appeared to fly in formation. There were four of us that witnessed the event.  The only rational explanation we could come up with is that they were shiny, helium filled balloons.  I&rsquo;ve seen balloons in the sky before and, because of the reasons I outlined earlier, I truly don&rsquo;t believe in this hypothesis.  It is also a very strange coincidence that this would have happened at the same time and place the shuttle would have been reentering the atmosphere.

Lights go from very dim to extremely brightAs we were sitting on our dock on the Potomac river near the small town of Bedington, WV we observed numerous small and medium white lights that traveled in the same pattern. We have watched these events for over 5 years. These lights sometimes seem to get extremely bright, almost like an afterburner on a jet fighter. They are extremely high in the sky and the lights do NOT blink. They are steady and there is no sound. They travel at an extreme speed.

Light weight boots were noticed on its feet. The ears and nose appeared normal for a humanoid. The head was slighly larger in proportion to the thorax than would be normal yet was attractive in its shape. Dark brown hair covered the top and back giving it a receeding hairline appearence. We encounterd this personas we were leaving the rocky summit of this Mountain. There are only two trails that leave the summit and our backs were between the subject and the trail head. We had no prior warning of his approach to us and seemed to appear out of nowheare. He greeted us by asking the question, &quot;What can you tell me about the flora and fauna here.&quot; I asked him to clairify what he wanted to know. &quot; I want to know if there are Bears here and are they dangerous.&quot; I informed him that here are small Black Bears here but they are not aggressive towards humans in general. He responded, &quot;Very good&quot;. His voice was normal sounding with no accent. He stuck us both to be a college professor or scientists in his questioning but had such a gross lack of basic knowledge about the woods that we both turned in surprise to talk about this person, made eye contact  and then turned quickly back to talk more with him and he was gone.  There was no possible way that he could have gotten out of sight of us so quickly as there is a very limited amount of room on the rock we were standing and it led directly to the trail behind him.

Shocked to see a large well lit top-shaped object flying west to east over our farm and just south of our house heading over the rideau river. was too upset to wonder what it was. just stared. object was well lit in relief by the full moon behind it. originally thought dog must be barking at the moon but he never really barks and being a bulldog really can&apos;t that well ... its a lot of effort for him and he is always quiet which is why i even got up to see what he was on about. I would guess the object was quite large, quite high up - 2000 feet? - could not really tell - was large ... object was greyish where the moon was illuminating it - definitely darker than the surrounding sky, had many bright lights on bottom in rings - random big square yellowish lights - and had a few red lights and other smaller white lights sprinkled over the surface randomly. could not see the top of it from my angle. no lights blinked. object did not spin, windows were wide open last night and object made no noise. moved very slowly eastward. watched it for about 5 to 10 seconds but seemed longer. i was really upset at what i saw .. i remember saying WTF out loud and went to another window on the other side of the bedroom for a better look as tree blocking my view from first window i viewed it from but object did not reappear on other side ... i continued to look for a few more minutes but saw nothing ... my dog stopped barking after i lost sight of the object and i went back to bed. looked at the clock and time was exactly 12:54 am so i saw something at 12:52-53. really upset me to see this, have no idea what it was and i had a lot of trouble going back to sleep. really tired today. searched the internet today to see if anyone else saw something last night and found this site to leave this message. the object was not a plane - too low for that - shape was all wrong. shaped like a child&apos;s top but did not spin .. had a lot of lights on it. it was huge. i could see this really well last night because of the full moon. image is imprinted in my mind and i can&apos;t forget it. i am hoping someone on the other side of the river saw it too last night so i know i am not losing my mind!

The three lights disappeared at different times.", "grouping of  seven yellowish-white lights traveling in the skyWe were sitting on the back porch, when my mother stood up in awe of something.  I assumed it was a late firework, and ran around to her side of the table.  There was a grouping of lights in the dark sky.  There were five, yellowish-white round lights in the sky.  They were traveling at a slow gliding pace through the dark sky.  There was no noise.  There was a sixth light following closely behind.  Further back a seventh light followed.  We ran through the house to the front door to continue seeing them.  We ran, excitedly exclaiming, &quot;It&apos;s a UFO&quot;.  We opened the front door and were able to continue watching them travel through the sky.  i immediately yelled for my husband to come quickly, that he had to see this.  He came out and also watched them as the went through the sky, the first five, then the sixth, and ultimately the seventh.  The first grouping made a wide turn to the east and the sixth and seventh made the same wide turn heading east as if following.  There was no noise outside at that time.  it was very quiet with no sound of any kind.  The objects were not at a high enough level for aircraft and certainly had no corresponding sounds.  They were not fireworks as they stayed on the same level trajectory and same consistent light.  Embers from fireworks would have died down and gone towards the ground. We all three are certain we did not see any type of aircraft or fireworks.  The objects were lower than aircraft but much higher than birds would fly. We can not explain what would have caused this unusual sight.", "Star like objects flickering and flying very fast in the day time. No sound.Before work, I was sitting out side when I felt light headed and dizy (it was about 110 out side) when I just happened to look up at the moon that was out during the day. It was bright and sunny with a few light clouds. I saw what appeared as a star. It flickered with no pattern and was sometimes very bright.I thought It was my dizyness but Another appeared and moved from the high southern sky to the east. It started out above the clouds and swooped below them. A jet was traveling near by and gave me a good idea of how fast it was going. The object was much further than the jet but was traveling much faster. More star like objects appeared and flew in different directions disappearing and reappearing, flickering and flashing. It seemed like they where reflecting the sun light cause no light can be seen in the daylight that brightly. There were no wings or noticeable shape. When it didn&rsquo;t reflect the sun, it seemed to disappear. This I think would be something you wouldn&rsquo;t see without light reflecting on it. I ran inside my office and grabbed some co workers. They laughed at me and asked what I was smoking.I just pointed up and said look. They ALL 7 saw them and we stood staring and pointing for a good 15 mins. They were hard to see till your eyes adjusted to them in the bright Arizona sun. But everyone knew they where NOT any aircraft we knew of. I can&rsquo;t say how many there where do to the fact they would disappear. But at least 5.

The travelling speed could have only seemed slow due to the distance and taking into account a possible upword movement. On first sighting, the globes seemed close together, but crossing the sky it appearded to be a loose formation, 4-5 moving ahead, a middle field consisting of 8-10 lights, and 2 more far back. Towards the end of the spectacle, the first 4-5 seemed to be above a strip of clouds high up, because they were partly hidden by it, then reappeared; while the last two were just below a strip of clouds.The light intensity did not seem to fade because they &quot;winked&quot; out, but faded rather because of putting distance between them &amp; us.We took some pics, but they&apos;re not good enough to make out more than a few points of light.", "Cambria UFO 07/10/2007 and strange earthquake felt on 07/18/2007At Approximately 23:30 on July 10th I went out in my driveway to smoke a cigarette.  My house is on a hill facing West with a view of the Pacific Ocean.  It was a cloudless night with a waning moon.  I witnessed a craft that was a large orange glowing orb object traveling just above the horizon come out of the North, headed south, with a smaller white glowing orb following it.  At first I believed it to be an airplane or helicopter traveling very quickly and very low over the water, only a few hundred feet at most.  Then I witnessed the white object move closer to the larger orange object and then disappear as it came right to it.  I then noticed that there was no sound at all coming from them.  The orange orb stopped in mid flight and disappeared into what I assume was the ocean, leaving behind a faint white glow out in the water that lasted for a couple minutes.On July 18, 2007 a series of loud rumblings were heard on the Central Coast.  At 14:12 I heard a faint boom, then, approximately 10 seconds later heard a rumble and felt my house vibrate just like an earthquake had hit it.  The rumble lasted about 3 to 4 seconds.  I have lived in an area where military jets do maneuvers all my life, and have heard and felt sonic booms many times.  This however most definitely did not feel like a sonic boom at all, and felt just like a magnitude 3 to 3.5 earthquake.  The air force reported to the local media that they were conducting training with their new F-22 Raptors 50 miles off the coast, however the planes were reported to have returned to their airbase by 13:00.  NASA also reported conducting super sonic test flights near Edwards AFB, but both locations are quite far from here.  USGS reported no earthquakes in California that day that would have matched that magnitude.", "Bright lights are seen for seconds then vanish after a house blocks viewWas on my way home, the road right before my road. It was a very very dark night. In the distance I noticed two extremely bright lights. I would say they were spaced probably about 50 feet apart. I saw them, then a house blocked my view and when I past the house it vanished. There were no blinking lights as on an airplane or helicopter. It wasn&apos;t stadium lights or construction work. The area it was spotted in is just grass / dirt. This is the second sighting I&apos;ve had, and this one was very close to the other one back in 1999. I would say it was about 1/2 mile ahead of me. It almost resembled the other craft I saw before.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Right over the top of me and so close I may have been able to hit it with a rockOver the years, I have told only family and friends about my sighting.  After just seeing a show about a UFO sighting in 2000 in Illinois by some guy and 4 police, I have to share this with people who are actually interested in this sort of thing as I&rsquo;ve always felt I should have documented it some how.  I grew up in south Florida but have lived in another state for over 20 years.  I am a 47 year old professional and I am an outdoor enthusiast. I am in to nature and have always had a keen awareness of my environment and surroundings. Twenty nine to thirty years ago I saw a huge wedge shaped object fly directly over me in Coral Springs FL.  At a very late hour, 1 AM, 2 AM or somewhere there about, after dropping a friend off, I was east bound on Sample Rd and was stopped at a red light at Coral Hills Dr. Back then, populations were less and there were no other cars on the road.  While sitting at the light, it was like it came out of nowhere but suddenly appeared over the tree tops heading due south at about a block west of University Dr which was one block east. It was so low that a shot from a shotgun would have easily hit it.  It was so long I leaned onto the passenger seat and could see the bottom as it came over, but then sat back up and could still see it on the driver&rsquo;s side and it moved slow at maybe 30 mph. It probably took at least 30 seconds to pass completely over me. It got about a mile ahead of me by the time the light changed and I could run up and turn south on University. It never seemed to speed up but gradually got further as I kept catching red lights and after several miles, I stopped following and turned around but noticed it appeared to be starting to turn toward Ft Laud airport. That fact has always made me question what I absolutely know I saw. I have always described it as being as long a football field and wedge shaped. Like on the TV show it was an elongated triangle shape. It had the 3 white lights, one in each corner, and the red flashing light rear of center. It was not black like in the 2000 sighting. It was more gray color and I remember it having what looked like steel plating. It made NO noise what so ever and I don&rsquo;t remember the lights being overly bright. It was fairly pointed at the front and about as wide as a four lane road with a median. I remember the rear once it passed over was thick or tall (it had huge mass) but I don&rsquo;t remember it being lit across the rear. It had no wings and the fact that I could hear nothing as it passed over still makes no sense to me.  Another thing that&rsquo;s always made me question my own eyes was the tree tops didn&rsquo;t sway or bend what so ever, but as close as it was I&rsquo;ve always thought there should have been at least a breeze if not wind. I&rsquo;ve never stopped having a hard time believing what I saw that night until seeing that show on the 2000 sighting in Illinois.  The descriptions and 3D images were so similar, I got goose bumps while watching and it felt like I was seeing my experience all over again. All these years I&rsquo;ve wished I would see one again to prove to myself I wasn&rsquo;t nuts and that TV show was like I was seeing it again. That show ended by noting secret military craft stay secret usually around 10 years. Well, like I said in the beginning, I saw mine 29 to 30 years ago so maybe I did see what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

So it may have been something from Boeing -- who knows. But after six months living here, this is unlike anything we&rsquo;ve seen, and we see a lot of flying craft passing over the lake.Around 10:45 p.m. a flashing white light caught my eye.  It looked like a strobe light and was moving north to south quickly. I thought at first it was a police light but realized it was in the air, not on a street on Mercer Island as first thought.  My husband and I went out onto our back deck to get a better look, and the light suddenly reversed direction, moving from south to north.  My husband said, &quot;Oh my god, look how fast it&apos;s going!&quot; Then the light moved as if it were coming toward us (west).  Then it moved southwest over our house and disappeared from our view.Whatever it was sounded like a plane, not a helicopter, but there were none of the blue or red flashing lights you usually see on plane wings; it was just a white light that would come completely on, the go completely off, so you couldn&apos;t see it at all in the split-second that the light was off.Just after this light disappeared, two planes appeared to the north and the difference was marked -- their lights appeared more yellow and they appeared to be moving much slower than whatever else we saw.Anyway, it was different, so there it is.

It zipped behind a tree and kind of just hovered there, then a round white light came off it and flew back and forth between the trees and it kept flashing, almost like it was taking pictures.  After it flew back and forth, it then went up and down and then returned to the bigger ship (for lack of better words). Then the big ship slowing flew out of the tree and flew into the next tree and once again just sort of hovered while the white light flew out again and did the same pattern. Then it flew to the third tree and once again the same thing happened.  I couldn&apos;t focus on the big &quot;ship&quot; because it was covered by the tree, but I could still see the flashing lights.  The little one that flew back and forth looked like a perfectly round ball of light. Then after the third trip,  It hovered in the third tree for a bit and then the street lights that were around that tree got very dim, and this ship kind of took off really fast - went across the sky - not up or anything.

A light in the middle of the three lights, that couldn&apos;t be seen before, flashed red while the others turned off.  Then the red light shut off and the others lights turned back on.The craft appeared to freak out when it flashed the red light because it began going back and forth at extraordinary speeds very recklessly.

It was about a thousand feet high, and absolutley silent.  There were no other lights on the craft, and no way to see the shape of the craft. So I snaped off a photo.  As soon as the flash went off, the orange light moved like it was looking in my direction.  Kinda like someone moving a beam of light accross your eyes.

EVERY star in the sky was white, white maybe a bluish twinkle to it. this was just red blinking light. but it was so tiny to see, i was thinking maybe it was mars, i know thats red, and maybe the atmosphere made the &quot;blinking&quot; just much more apparent. after 10 minutes of wondering what it was, i remembered my video camera. i am an aviation minded person, and i live near BUSH (hobby) airport. i know what an airliner looks like at 40 k, at night....this was MUCH higher. what i did notice about what i saw, was how it moved...but so slow, that i couldn&apos;t recognize it at first. the only way was to use reference points on the horizon (my house) over time. when i noticed it didn&apos;t follow the same path as the rest of the stars, i started to doubt myself. at first it was moving towards a solo star in the southwestern side of the sky. minutes later, checking my same reference points. it had moved away considerably from the solo star. it also  had two smaller items that were emitted. they were bright white, floated around the &quot;red blinker&quot;, back and forth a few times, then rejoined. this happened twice. (but not caught on film.)  with the camera, i could then tell it was TWO rapid strobes next to each other going off. but, it also emitted green color as well. it was a third color, but not a third &quot;bulb&quot;  so both lights went from red to white, and sometimes green. but it was FAST!! like hyper speed Morse code... the thing disappeared to my naked eye, but i could still hold it on the camcorder. but it was fading. it didn&apos;t &quot;go below the horizon&quot; it didn&apos;t &quot;take off like a rocket, in some direction..it just FADED...not like an aircraft going over a large distance.i searched for another ten minutes. couldn&apos;t find it again. have 30 minutes of footage (roughly 10 minutes actual, on and off). have no idea what it is. here is a quick video that i did for an onlinde aviation forum . this is heavily cut just for &quot;quick and dirty purpsoses&quot; to see if they have any idea. i have no clue what it is, the way things are these days, its hard to tell, so i try not to speculate...it is what it is.

The OOD at the time of the incident refused to make a log entry in his log. However he was only one of many witnesses. You guys should really check this out. I&apos;ve seen some obvious hoaxes here and this was a real encounter&apos;((NUFORC Note:  We have written the source of this statement, and requested that he contact the other witnesses, and have them submit reports, too.  PD))", "After a few months, THEY are still here!On or about May 29 2007, I reported seeing 5 objects at various positions in the night sky in my area [of northern Rock Hill SC.]  These stationary objects were bright white and flashing/strobing red and green in a counter-clockwise motion.  I&apos;m reporting that those objects are still visible but in varying positions and at varying distances in the night sky. This has been going on for over two months, and maybe even before my first notice of them, and I&apos;m definitely concerned.  These &apos;indistinguishably shaped&apos; bright white objects that are definitely strobing red and green are acting almost like sentries in some way.  They&apos;re just &apos;there&apos; every night but in different positions and at different altitudes, BUT they are clearly discernible as being machines of some type. These are NO planets/star bodies (unless we&apos;ve never been told about planets flashing/strobing red and green in a counter-clockwise motion.)  Other heavenly bodies and aircraft are clearly discernable from these objects. (As an aside:  Maybe this is going to sound even stranger but I recently realized that I haven&apos;t seen, felt or heard ANY mosquitos (and other types of local insects) in my neighborhood all summer.  There has been no spraying, tablet placement in standing water and no word of any kind from local government about either taking place.  I&apos;m not saying that the appearance of the objects I&apos;ve been seeing has anything to do with a surprising decrease in the &apos;bug&apos; population in my area, but there may be.  I&apos;ve never not been popped off and on all summer by mosquitos.)((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))"]
