["unusual visionI always go out on my lani before bed.  I like to watch the planes coming into a nearby airport and I watch the landing lights go on.I noticed an unusual looking plane, I thought, with just lights on the wingtips, no blinding lights or anything else.  It was moving along somewhat like a glider.  As it got closer a tree was blocking my vision so I stood up to watch when it passed the tree into my view again.At that point it slowly came down and towards me.  It stopped right in front of my lani screen.  I walked a few steps closer and it moved back a few feet.  It was a dark night and I could see nothing but the two lights on each side, at that point about 4 feet apart.  No beams at all, something like a two flashlights and the batteries getting low.I stepped back and it again moved up to the lanai screen.At that point, I was frightened, went into my house and closed the sliding glass doors and blinds.  Nothing further happened and please send me some feedback.What did I see?", "A yellow light over Split (Croatia - Europe)That night while I was looking at the cloudy night sky and I noticed a yellow light SE of the City of Split. I am an amateur astronomer so I looked through my telescope (20x magnification) towards the object. At first I thought I was looking at Venus but then I realized that the sky was cloudy. There was no star, planet or some other extraterrestrial object visible! I looked through my telescope again (now at 250x magnification) and the object was not moving at all. Now I was convinced that I was not looking at anything natural. The object was hovering 1500m from the ground (or so) for 8 minutes. After that 8 minutes it simply disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The larger object was accompanied by smaller red light type object.Weather information during sightings were Hot, Humid and Clear skies.", "UFO Military AircraftI heard a large helicopter approaching from the south and went outside in the back yard to have a look. From the southeast almost directly over my house tonight, about 9:20PM were two objects flying in tandem about 100&apos; apart, they both had an almost white reflective-like hull with absolutely no lights, strobes, cockpit lights turned on anywhere, being followed closely by one military black hawk helicopter with one red strobe light on. The two objects were out in front, had no wings, no noticeable rotors spinning, cigar-like shaped structures. They couldn&apos;t have been helicopters as there was no multi-rotor &quot;swash&quot; in the air that you hear with multiple helicopters in flight. They kept a tight tandem formation. All three aircraft were flying in tandem at the same speed together about the normal speed as any commercial helicopter. As they passed by the house I quickly ran to the front of the house and watched as they turned and went westbound over Hwy 50 over the mountains, the two objects out in front of the black hawk becoming harder to see the further away they went. With just a hint of setting sun in the west I could still see the black hawk rotor blades but nothing for the other two objects in front. The elevation here is about 4500&apos; and the aircraft were flying probably at around 7500&apos; - 8000&apos; not too low but not real high either. It is extremely unusual for any aircraft not to have it&apos;s lights on in the night sky at this time of night. Something very strange was getting a military escort tonight to somewhere. About 25 minutes later I heard and saw the same red strobed military helicopter return from the west heading south, but it was too far west to see if the other objects were still with it.", "Rectangle, no wings, no sound, no lightsAugust 5 2006 8:15 pm in the skys over th San Fernando valley I spoted a rectangular object 500 feet above me at dusk.  It had no wings, it made no sound and had no lights.  It was going very fast, I would estimate 500 mph + and what appeared in a perfect straight line.  From above me to over the horizon it took a mere 3-4 seconds. Nobody else was with me and I had no camera, and if I had I would not have had the time to take a picture.", "Blue-ish fireballs in sky.As I was sitting in my backyard, during a very clear night, I noticed in the corner of my eye a streaking flash,like a shooting star. As I looked up to see it over my head, it exploded in a blue flash. The flash looked like a fiery ball that then seperated into two blue-ish fireballs that appeared to chase each other in a tight circle in the very spot the &quot;explosion&quot; happened.The fireballs had long tails that form a circle when the chased each other. The fireballs continued to circle one another faster adn faster and closer and closer until they came together and exploded again in a larger blue-ish explosion. The fireballs then seperated, each going opposite directions, one appearing to burn out and the other compressing into a tiny star-like ball. The star-like object continued its path across the sky, looking much like a satellite, until it could no longer be seen. There were three other people with me, but they only saw what appeared to be the satellite crossing the sky. The entire episode concerning the firball-like objects lasted a mere 6-7 seconds.", "the object stopped in mid air and changed directions 4 times, then flew away northThe object appeared at about 21:15 on 08/01/3007.

Then flew out of site.", "Several UFOs moving around for 60 seconds over a park.Early this morning my friend and I were walking accross the park, with our hounds. If it wasn&apos;t for the bright flash of lights we would never have noticed it. We were wondering what the light was when all of a sudden they all came pouring over the hill. It was terrifing. Their crafts were shaped like an orange, only grey. The ships flew around for roughly one minute, then began to move behind the hill again. When we went up the hill, one of the crafts was landed. We were horrified, and ran back to the park.", "The object was a light red or peach colored light in the southern sky.We were driving down a country road at about 10:30 at night heading south. We saw a light red or peach colored object in the sky. It looked as if it was next to a couple of cell phone towers in the city of Noblesville. It then moved northeast a little ways. We then turned onto a road going west and the object was gone.", "3 bright lights in triangle formation hovering over St. George Maine 6/14/2007@22:10I am a 25 year old, sane, sober mother and wife.At 22:10 on 6/14/2007, as I headed home from a night class, I witnessed  3 very bright red, low hovering lights in the shape of a triangle (no noise heard). I live near the Owls Head Airport and thought maybe it was a plane, but realized once I pulled over on the side of the street, that this craft spanned a greater distance than a typical plane.  I watched for a few minutes and then decided to continue on my way.  A mile or so down the country road to my house, I decided that seeing where the lights were still present, that I would turn around and watch them longer.  n the time it took me to turn around (30 seconds maximum), the lights faded and reappeared a couple seconds later miles and miles away towards the towns of Thomaston/Waldoboro area.  I know that a couple cars traveling the other way braked their own vehicles, (I watched this object in my rear-view mirror as I was driving) but I haven&rsquo;t heard any reports in the news or local newspapers.", "FIRST TIME REPORTED Late November, 1978 Mt Rainier National Park &amp; Ashford. Double Sighting, 6 Hours  Over the last three decades, I have debated within myself, as to whether or not I should report the following incident: I experienced the following beginning late November 1978, Mt. Rainier National Park,  Longmire Wilderness Center, Snow Camping with two other individuals. We arrived at Longmire within Mt. Rainier National Park, in the late afternoon.  Their was substantial snow fall which blocked our access to continueing up the Mountain via Hwy 706..  We set up our tent rather quickly due to the snow becoming a snow and rain mix.  We decided that due to the change in weather we would hit the hay early.  Approximately at 2:00 am I awoke with a Migraine which was unbearable.  I awoke the two other individuals and we decided that we would head back home.  Upon packing our backpacks and gear we saw a extremely bright object which we perceived to be a falling star or maybe a meteorite entering the atmosphere and speeding across the horizon.  The object dissappeared and we all thought how lucky we were to see such a lovely event, not realizing what was to come. We proceeded out of the park via Hwy 706, it was raining lightly and their was snow and ice on the roadway which subsided upon reaching the Nisqually Entrance.  We proceeded at moderate speed toward Ashford, Washington.  As we arrived within the small town we immediately saw a bluish white light of great brilliance directly above a telephone pole which lite up the entire roadway. I yelled at the driver to stop which we did immediately. The light was in the shape of two diamonds stuck together at one point about the size of a two seater sports car. Within the vehicle we all were talking fast and loudly, what is it, what should we do, where is the camera, why should we take a picture, UFO pictures are never good enough to confirm an actual sighting, should we get out of the car etc.  We were nervous to the point of laughing and screaming.  I remember getting the old fashion,  immediately developing camera out of the glove compartment and then turning to the driver and saying I am getting out of the car. Upon exiting the vehicle I was transfixed on the objects brilliant blue light and the noticable lack of sound and or wind which I was expecting.  My last memory was hearing the other two individuals yell and scream for me to come back as I walked  toward the brilliant object above the telephone pole..I also remember  another vehicle, a station wagon coming from behind the telephone pole on what I think was a side road and stopping also.  The next thing I remember is being back in the car with the two other individuals screaming drive, drive and being extremely frightened and visably shaking. The station wagon I remember seeing was no long there, and the driver proceeded to drive as fast as the roads would allow, with our top speed being over 80 MPH, the object was directly overhead being brilliantly illuminated.  It never waivered from keeping up with our vehicle, turn for turn, stop for stop.  Upon reaching the Eatonville Valley the sky became huge and open, we continued down into the valley and watched the object fly directly out into the middle of the sky, stop and then proceed directly upward at a high velocity and dissappear. Myself and the other two individuals proceeded home to Tacoma, Washington and spent the next decade argueing about the amount of time that went by versus what it normally takes to reach Tacoma. To make a long story short there were three hours not accounted for and a picture in the glove compartment not of the mysterious object but of our vehicle empty with all the doors, hood and rear opened, with our  gear stacked around the vehicle.  None of us took the picture.  The irony, it was me who said why take a picture of a UFO they never come out to prove an actual sighting let alone an actual meeting.  The other two individuals involved always agree that something happened but currently one refuses to discuss it and the other prefers not to discuss it. They both become nervous and upset whenever I bring it up.   Myself, I want to dicuss it,  The reason, because of what has happened since the incident.", "there was no clouds and i have better than average eyes.well it happend while i was outside in my backyard at about 1-3 o&apos;clock PM with clear blue skys and NO clouds and me and my little brother saw a silver craft saucer at the start and changed into a plane one of those airliners but remained the same speed and then turn into a blimp agian at the same speed and turned into a jet f-16 and back into a saucer and speed off at extremly great speed the whole thing lasted about a minute or 2 and im not crazy i knew what i saw and i will belive until the day die((NUFORC Note:  We are unconvinced as to whether this is a serious report.

One object leading, one following, on what looked to be the same course. The second object was not close to the first. Objects were very high in the sky. Objects came from the northwest traveling south east. Objects were observed for approx 1-2 minutes as they crossed the sky. About 3/4 of the way across the sky, the first objects bright white light began to dim to a faint pinkish/redish hue, then to nothing, no lights at all. Hard to tell exactly, but it did look like that when the second object got to the same place in the sky where the first object had started to dim, the second objects bright white light started to dim also, going to a faint pinkish/redish hue, then to no lights at all. The area of the sky where the lights blinked off was constantly observed for approx 10-15 minutes after the lights went off, and no lights/activity was noticed. Not being an expert, but knowing what the commercial jets look like at night that fly in this area, all have some form of blinking traffic lights. I cannot see these as being commercial planes. Probably military???, but why would they turn off their lights completely?

PD))", "star like object flys in night skyOn June 3, 2007, a friend and I was fishing in Orange Beach, Alabama at the Alabama point bridge. The fishing place was packed full of people, probably of about fifty people because every fishing spot was taken up by someone fishing from underneath the bridge to the other end of the breaker wall where the road pavement ends which is about two hundred feet from point to point.  We arrived at the fishing place at about 4:00PM.  The sky was clear, and it was very windy.  It wasn&apos;t too hot because of the wind.  At that time, not too many people were catching fish.  The tide was going out into the Gulf, and quicker as each hour passing thus creating a swift current in the boating channel.  Around 8:00PM, darkness  began.  Stars also began appearing.  When it got dark, the fish bites became more regular rather then far between.  I was fixated on this large star located due east, probably a planet because it was so large.  Around 9:00PM while glancing now and then at this large star, I noticed  star like object appear near the large star. At first, I thought another star was appearing as the night time sky above was slowly rotated over us.  My thoughts then changed to possibly a plane approaching us, but if it was a plane, it wasn&apos;t the normal white light that a plane normally projects forward as it fly in the sky.  At one point while I was watching this object get closer to our position which I estimated the object was at least five miles away, I thought I saw it jitter up and down.  I squint with my eyes thinking maybe the wind was tossing me around a little thus causing me to see this object jiggling up and down slightly.  That didn&apos;t help, the object still appeared to be jiggling around almost as in sharp jerks of up, down, and sideways motion.  I called out to my friend who was intensely fishing, &quot;Do you see that star&quot;?  She was almost ignoring me when she finally look up at me and saw me pointing to the star like object, then she glanced at the star like object. I then said, &quot;I think it! s an UFO &quot;.  She looked at it for a few seconds then went back fishing not saying a word since a fish was tugging at her pole which she caught. When I first saw this object, it was about the same size as the star like planet, but slightly smaller.  Then something very odd happen which I now changed my mind of it being a star or plane.The object was probably about two or three miles away at about 5,000 feet in altitude from our position when it made a wide turn to the north.  If it was a plane, technically, I shouldn&apos;t have longer seen its headlights.  Not only that, I should have seen its strobe lights flashing to indicate that it was a plane.  No identification lights were seen.  And it still look like a star.  The altitude the object was at was extremely way too low for it to be a satellite.  The alarm bells went off inside me: UFO.  I always carry a camera in my car and luckily, the battery was still charged, and I haven&apos;t used up all of the digital space.  I quickly walked to the car and grab the camera. I could have quickly took some pictures in automatic mode, but I didn&apos;t trust that the camera would take a picture in that mode, especially with the flash possibly occurring and distorting the picture.  I quickly search for the night time mode of available light on my camera knowing that I should get a  picture in that mode, but forgot about the shutter speed, it was too was slow.  I found the object in the sky now looking at its backside which it is also getting further away from me at the speed of a slow moving jet.  I took the first picture shot and I was stun because the shutter was staying opened too long, so I tried as best as I could to hold the camera steady.  After about a second, the stutter closed.  I was really worried that the shutter would stay open for about five seconds.  Anybody who has ever tried to take night picture could probably tell you what will happen if you hold the camera while the shutter is too slow.  I had no time to change the mode, so I took another picture holding the camera as steady as possible.  I was able to get four pictures before I could no longer see the object in the monitor.While I was taking the pictures, one of the fishermen look at me and then looked at the direction I was taking the picture.  He noticed the object and asked me, &quot;What is it&quot;?  I replied, &quot;Probably an UFO&quot;.  He looked back at it again then looked at me strangely then continue on fishing.  For the rest of the night, he just ignored me as if I was a fruit cake or a nut.People, I just don&apos;t understand while some people can&apos;t believe that UFO&apos;s can be possible.  Some worried that by believing UFO&apos;s are possible may affect their religious beliefs.  I&apos;m religious, but it hasn&apos;t affect by beliefs.  As one person said to me, &quot;I&apos;ll believe UFO&apos;s are real when one lands on my front door steps and knocks on my front door.&quot;  I&apos;m not a fruit cake, but a very well educated person with a open mind, not closed as of some people.  Something is flying in our skies, and its not just a plane, balloons, kites, meteorites, birds, etc.   And the government needs to get involved in explaining some of these flying object because I beginning to think they are UFOs.   Picture of what I have taken that night is being sent via email. Not great pictures, but it something.((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from the same source.

I turned to the side to tell my friend to look at it when it was stationary and my friend looked up and then it speeded off. But he also was able to see the UFO.

When I first saw it, it was far south and within matter of no time it moved towards our direction up in the sky towards the north. As it came in line above us it veered 90 degrees and went towards the eastern direction and disappeared. It was very fast without any noise.

Looking ahead of me, I saw in the sky what appeared to me at first to be a typical passenger jet.  It was a perfect cigar shape and appeared to be white with a black band around the middle of it. The longer I looked at it, the more I began to notice things that made me see that it wasn&apos;t a passenger jet.  I&apos;m not the greatest at guessing distances, but, the craft was flying at, I would say, 10000-12000 feet.

I would also say that it wasn&apos;t more than 3 miles in front of me. I did not hear any noise coming from it at all, whether it was too far or not.  I also did not see any kind of wings, fins or engines on the craft.  It appeared to be smoothly cruising to the north, right over Fruitville, clost to I-75.

Reported to Beale Air Force Base.I was watching a late show one evening in 81/82 when I became aware of a very low basso tone. At first I wasn&apos;t thinking anything about it except how odd it was. But I continued to watch tv. As a little time progressed on the tone became deeper, stronger, and more insistant, much louder until it was rattling my glass table top and windows. At this I jumped up and ran for the sliding glass door to see if a Jumbo jet was going to land on my house. It sounded so low in the evening air. I knew we were on a flight path for Beale air force base and we were used to hearing planes now and again in the daytime but never this late at night. I was scared the sound was so invasive. As I launched myself out the back door I landed on a small concrete slab patio with a start as I tried to gauge where the sound was coming from. I looked up at a pine tree in our back yard tall or so and then swiveled toward the sound of the bass tone. As I turned looking up the whole time I could not believe what I was witnessing...there hanging no more than about 200 feet about the ground and moving at a smails pace was a cigar shaped gun metal toned UFO. I was dumfounded as I watched it inch thru the night sky. There were no other sounds but that deep bassso drone as it approached until it was right over my home, and partly obliterated by the roof of my house. Suddenly it stopped dead in the air and as it did so the drone stopped also. It was utterly quiet with not a bird, nor frog, no cricket. It was incredibly eerie! As I watched it just hang there in the void above me I searched its superstructure for some sign of familiarity with airplanes I was familiar with, but there were no wings, no propellars, no windows or portholes, no designs of any kind, just a long dark polished cigar shaped something right over my house dead still in the air. I had a long piece of property, longer than wide and it clearly could have spanned the length of a football field. I continued to watch it, I don&apos;t know how long, curious, and in w! ondermen t when suddenly one light ticked on and then off and a little ways away another came on and then off...this continued around the entire bottom of the middle half of the structure that had settled in above my house in a half circle arc and then it disappeared beyond the roof of my home until I finally saw the same light that had started it all tick on and off again and then with that a bright all encompassing light surrounded where I was standing and illuminated the top of my home. I remember thinking to myself &quot;they&apos;ve seen me&quot; and this is where I have an odd double memory of what happened next, I remember wanting to jump out of the light, but I do not remember doing it. I remember staying there and looking into the light. I remember when just before the light came on there was an odd metallic sound like something industrial going on, but I did not see any opening. It was not a blinding light but it was without a doubt the brightest light I had ever seen and yet it did not hurt my eyes and I do not have a remembrance of even wanting to blink my eyes it was all so intrigueing to me. It was almost as tho the light itself was alive, it was filled with rianbows and small moving things, I can only liken it to looking at semen, or bacteria under a microscope, it moved fluidly. It was truly one of the most unique and beautiful things that I have ever seen.I felt an intense euphoria as I watched the motions within the light swirling about in slow motion. Just incredible sight. Very hypnotic, and calming. I do not know how long I stood there, it didn&apos;t seem like long but I was utterly entranced so who knows. After awhile the light went out with the same metalic sound, just blinked off. And immediately the ship began to move again, but in no more a hurry than it had been in coming and that basso profundo sound was back. I don&apos;t remember moving from the spot, I remember thinking I should run and get my husband so he could see this but I didn&apos;t do that and I cannot explain why, at least not until the ship had just p! ast the trees on the other side of our house. Then I ran into my house and tried to wake my husband up, which was a bit of a feat, and then he refused to go outside to see as this thing had not gotten far away by then, but he refused to go even tho he could hear the sound it mad. His sister who was visiting also did not wake up. After this my life turneds upside down as I began a feverish research into all kinds of things I had never been interested in before. My life has never been the same. After the incident I called up and reported the sighting to Beale Air Force base and inquired about the possibility of them having such a craft which they assured me that had not. Years later I was recounting the incident to a friend when my son of 17 walked thru the door and said &quot;Oh, I remember that mom, I was watching from my window in the bedroom&quot;. Well he was barely 2 when this happend and I had never told him about it. But before I could get into the rest of the description he filled in the blanks with having seen the white light all around me and how it &quot;danced&quot; with rainbows and seeing me just stand there for the longest time staring at it, and then it going out and watching me watch it go. He saw all of that. It was a real shock to me...I mean I couldn&apos;nt understand how a child of that age would remember such a thing, but he did. I have had other encounters, and many sightings, and strange phenomenon happen in my life, but this was one of the most life changing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I&apos;ve decided to come forth about what I saw (and tried to video tape) because of this specific report. The similarities between our sightings seem very close  However, my sighting was on May 30 2007 and first seen at 19:45 to 20:15 - I observed these for around 30 minutes!  When I first saw this object, I saw only one - then later I saw two. To the naked eye it looked like a very small white sphere that did not move - sort of like a planet. But it looked very different when viewed through the binoculars. At one point while viewing it with binoculars, the center of it suddenly flashed a strange metalic gold. I tried to video tape this object from inside my home while my camcorder was on the tripod - I could see this object in the East directly above the neighboring trees nearby around 7:45 pm. I started video taping around 7:49 pm. After a few tries (only caught a few bits of it on video), I ran outside to have a closer look at this with my 10X50 binoculars.  After observing it more closely for several minutes, getting a good look at what it was (see drawing ) I then decided to run back in the house and try to tape this again. I grab the camcorder and ran back outside and started to video tape again at 7:57 pm. Again, I was only able to get a few quick shots of this object on video. It was VERY hard to find this in the camera viewer lens of my JVC 25X optical camcorder - and its much to hard to find it on the LCD screen during daylight - and it was too small to pinpoint and focus on the object. I continued to try off and on attempts at capturing it on video - not easy to do in clear blue skies. I had to use the trees and far distant planes with contrails to help reference about where they were above in the blue sky . The video overall is about 9 minutes (because I would pause for a bit, then try to record through out the video). These objects were observed from  around 7:45 pm to 8:15 pm. The last part of my video records a few frames of both objects at 8:15 pm just before they head up a bit higher above the one huge fir tree then they head NORTH against the 7 MPH winds that were coming FROM the WNW!. I gave up trying to record them, and ran inside to see if I could still see them.. but could not. I immediately checked the weather conditions and it confirmed to me that these were not balloons because they headed away to the NORTH against the winds that night. I also took a screen shot of the weather report at that time. The video is not very good at all, and I cuss up a storm and at the time of recording these, I could not see them in the viewer lens, and was not sure I even caught them on the video.  After reviewing the MiniDV tape over, I did indeed catch several frames of them as I would zoom in and out where I was guessing they were in the blue sky. I used Exsate DV Capture software to be able to show the date &amp; time embedded on the MiniDV tape. I then compiled image shots from the video in the order shown on the tape and put them together as a swf and posted them online for viewing  - Select from the drop down box 800 to see this in LARGER VIEW:  http://media.putfile.com/PDX-UFOs-May-30-2007  Note regarding some of the images: I also included various shots that shows the trees - or planes in the far background. These are what I was using as a reference point -  I would then try to zoom from those areas to where I estimated they were hovering. My initial thought of these were balloons.  But when I went outside with my binoculars, I could see these were NOT balloons. And did not act like balloons. But even then, I thought they MIGHT be. But after trying to tape them and observing them for around 30 minutes, while they hovered above in the same general area not being affected by the wind, I realized they were probably not balloons - especially after watching them head away NORTH against the wind. Even after I looked at the weather report and the tape I really did not think it was enough to report this -- that is up until I found the report on your site and decided to come forth about what I saw. I am just so relieved to read that SOMEONE else in Portland, Oregon saw something similar to what I saw!", "An Disk-Shaped Ufo  Just at 8:00 we were in tution waiting for our teacher to come standing on the terrace suddenly watched an disk like object rushing at an speed of 90miles/hour(approx) with two ligting glowing in the dark cloudy sky and in just about 10 seconds it dissapear from our view.", "Brilliant golden boulder-like craftI was sitting on my front porch feeding the birds. A group of seagulls were circling overhead which caused me to look skyward. I observed a golden spherical object traveling WSW to ENE toward Lake Ontario.The sky was cloudless and the sun had started it&apos;s descent.The object can be best described as a large boulder and was of a brilliant golden color. The sun may have enhanced the color of the object but it had a clearly defined shape, not a blurry one that would be caused by light reflection. There was no sound or vapor trail.It was traveling much faster than an aircraft or satellite but slower than a meteorite . It had a definite shape and was only observed for a matter of 5 to 6 seconds. It&apos;s speed was such that it disappeared from view in the sky well before it reached the horizon. It is impossible for me to estimate it&apos;s altitude but it appeared to be less than that of an overflying aircraft.This location is approx. 3 nautical miles from John C. Munroe International Airport and there is a fair amount of traffic at times.It was not traveling in the direction of the airport and would have been at an altitude that would have prevented it from making a landing approach either here or at Pearson International in Toronto.I am a 61 year old male, retired from a professional position and am agnostic with regards to UFO&apos;s and their origin.

I parked behind my apt and was walking around the side of my building.  I decided to stop and take a leak before I went inside (hey I&apos;m in Wyoming!).  I was doing my business and looking at the stars when I noticed to the NW a bright light.  To me it looked like an airplane as it was low in the sky and moving toward my direction.  It is hard to say how far away it was, but a guess would be around 5-10 miles.  Thinking it was an airplane I thought it was odd that I didn&apos;t see any blinking nav lights on it, so I countinued to watch it.  After around 3-5 seconds of watching it began to change trajectory and began going up at what must have been a high rate of speed.  The light went through a color progression changing from the white light to white/orange,orange,orange/red, red then disappeared.  The upward movement traveled of a span of around 2.5-3&quot; of sky.  I stayed outside for several minutes afterward waiting to see if more lights appeared or this one returned and saw nothing.  The night itself was beautiful, no clouds and very dark with many stars that help to tract it trajectory upward.

No one talked about such things back then, especially in the narrow minded south.I woke from a sound sleep in the middle of the night, and sensed something.  My windows were high on the wall of my bedroom, so I stood on the bed to look outside.There, hovering over the woods next to my house, was a triangle shaped ship.  It had lights that ran along all 3 sides, outlining its shape.  It was at a distance of less than 3 tenths of a mile.  I watched it, too afraid that if I looked away, it would disappear, for several minutes, until I lost the feeling in my feet.  Then, it did an almost instant 180 degree turn and shot off into the night.  Traveling east to southeast, I guess.  It made NO sound, but there was that kind of sensation you get from something that you don&apos;t so much hear as feel.I turned on all the lights and refused to go back to sleep, to ensure that I had not dreamed the whole thing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

These lights were observed for 4-6 minutes.  I told my 17 year-old daughter to come out on the deck and see.  She observed, saying &quot;I was freaking her out with this sighting.&quot;  She went inside with me and when I returned the lights were gone.

Strange, loud, pulsating, humming sound.It was around 2:00AM CST when I heard the first noise of the craft. At first it sounded like a normal aircraft in the distance. However, as it got closer, it began to sound very different then a normal aircraft. It sounded kind of like a tornado in the distance. Almost like a &quot;hum&quot; as well; it was very soft. Then it got very loud, and had almost a &quot;pulse&quot; within the sound. It was so loud I could feel it in my mattress. I got up and approached my window to see what it was, but by the time I got there... It was gone. So I layed in my bed, and just assumed it was a normal aircraft. Then, at about 2:20AM CST, I heard the sound again in the distance. This time I was prepared and immediatley went to my window. I stared out there for a good 5 seconds. The &quot;hum&quot; got louder and louder. I kept starring... and saw nothing. No lights, nothing. Finally, in my peripheral, I saw a large, dark object sort of casually fliying across the sky. And I followed it through the trees. The craft was flying relitively low, as well as slow. And it had no lights at all. Because the craft had no lights, it was very hard for me to distinguish shape. It was kind of triangular, but still had other characteristics... which I can not completely describe. I attempted to take a photo; however, due to the light, the craft simply looked like a dark &quot;smudge&quot;. The craft was flying towards a nearby USAF base. Could it be a some kind of &quot;stealth&quot;? I do not know that much about planes. Even if it is an actual plane, though, why would it be flying so low? The base is close, but not that close. Also, why was it flying so slow? And why wouldn&apos;t it have any lights? And I&apos;ve NEVER heard a plane sounds like that. As of now... The craft has flown by many times, off in the distance.

Thanks.", "In June, I witnessed a bight object on a clear night moving east to west, then vanish out of sight in 3 secondsIn June, 1982, my fianc&eacute; and I witnessed a bright object traveling slowly from east to west. The night was very clear and the stars could be seen for miles. I got out of the car and for some unknown reason decided to look up in the sky. As I was looking into the eastern sky, I noticed a lighted object moving very slowly. I asked my fianc&eacute; to come and look at this object. She asked what it was in a very excited voice. I said, &ldquo;I think it is a UFO! All of the sudden the object stopped in front of us about 10 yards away at tree top level! We were both getting a little concerned. The object or occupants in the object were looking at us maybe, but it was too far away to tell. The lighted object hovered in the same position for about 30 seconds. I was getting goose bumps and starting to perspire as was my fianc&eacute;. Then all of a sudden the object moved to the west again slowly for a few seconds and then moved out of sight in about 3 seconds! It was just like in documentaries I have seen in recent years  Now the sighting was about a mile and a half away from an airport and air guard base. However, the object made no noise at all! I know enough about planes to know that they make some kind of noise and that they do not hover like this object did and then all of a sudden move out of sight in about three seconds. I have been around aircraft since I was young and my dad was a flight engineer on a B-24 bomber in WW2. I wanted to call the air guard base, but I was afraid the airmen at the base would just laugh. However, many years ago, an F-94 from the base chased an unknown object, but gave up the chase after being outrun. I spoke to a UFO expert about my sighting and he told me he believed that the occupants knew we were watching them and that is why the object hovered for about 30 seconds. I have gone over this sighting in my head for the past 25 years and wondered what the object was. I have come to the conclusion that it was either Air Force test vehicle or reverse-engineered object flown by our pilots OR, an alien aircraft. It was state of the art regardless of what the object was. The object in my opinion was saucer shape and very well lighted. My fianc&eacute; and I were married for about 9 years and then divorced and we had one son, now 19. He told me his mother showed him where we saw the object. I will say that I feel fortunate to have seen a UFO. I feel like a veteran and feel that it has changed my view on life differently. I believe there was a Jesus and he did walk on water, but I wonder if there was a scientific reason he was able to walk on water. Maybe we were seeded here on earth!  I would also like to convey to you about an incident that happened to my uncle at about the same time as my experience. My uncle was a farmer in Illinois. He told me at my wedding that he was riding on his tractor one day in his field. He told me he was driving slowly and this gold metal object came up to him and his tractor engine stopped on his tractor! He said he was very frightened. The object moved around him. He tried to start his tractor to get away from the object but it still would not start. The gold metal object finally moved away and moved out of sight in a few seconds. His tractor started up again, just like other people have experience with there cars when they saw UFOs. I believe my uncle was being studied by a probe. He told me he prayed the entire time the object was studying him and that he was very frightened. I just think that it is very coincidental that my uncle and I saw these objects about the same time. It may not be. I decided to write you because I saw SEEING IS BELIEVING, UFOS with Peter Jennings last night and saw the interview with the gentleman with National UFO Reporting Center and also this is the 60th anniversary of Roswell. I hope this helps by reporting what I saw 25 years ago and I have wanted to report this for many years.Thanks You((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Followed by USAF observation/intervention.At first it appeared to be a very bright star, as bright as Venus. Then this &quot;star&quot; moved rapidly across space. Soon we noticed it was one of many. They all had the ability to maneuver in multiple directions. Up, down, and side to side.  They had command of the sky. Shortly, an enormous number of military aircraft were called to the scene.  There were at least fifty fighter jets. These planes looked clumsy compared to the aircraft we had been observing. The UFOs had an incredible grace and range of motion that made the jets seem awkward.  This show continued for about forty-five minutes. Then the UFOs disappeared much as they had come.  They once again looked like bright stars and were instantly gone. My wife and son were with me.  All of us were astounded.

The lights did not appear to be moving or moving very slowly.  My first thought was oh a airplane. But then immediantaly I said no that is not an airplane because the two lights are way to far apart to be an airplaine and there was no blinking light on it like airplanes have.  The two lights were probablly 3 times the wing span of an airplane accross.  I kept watching the lights as I went down the road and the two lights were fixed to each other and not making hardly any movement.  Then I turned off university to go to sparkman and just as I was right near uah I looked up and ther was a huge traingle shaped craft above my head.  It was grey and black in color and I could see it very clearly.  It had a red light on the bottom.  I kept traveling and as I turned north onto sparkamn I saw the lights moving to the northeast I could no longer make out the triangle shape I just saw the two widespaced huge lights.  This event caused me to call the 3 local tv stations and ask if any one had reported seeing a triangle in the sky.  The respone I got from all 3 stations was no.  They did not seem to even want to know what I had seen.  At this point I started to doubt what I had seen bec there was a lot of traffic on the road and someone else had to have seen it.  The only thing that makes me think I did not just imagine it is that I watched it for about 5 min.  before I actually was underneighth it and saw the shape of it.  My impression is that it may be some kind of exp aircraft because we live right near redstone arsenal.  The object was not making any really unsual movement except that it did not appear to move at all but hover or move very slowly and I heard absolutely no sound coming from it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There were 3 adults and 2 children in the adjacent yard. We all saw a silent, dark gray object in the sky, it looked like it was a few miles away, just above the tree line. It was worm shaped, it looked kind of like a para-sail. It seemed to have three sections that were fairly straight, but combined together to make a shallow downward facing C shape - the open part of the C facing the ground. At first I thought it was a balloon or a kite, but it didn&apos;t behave like either. I ran into the house to find a camera, when I returned, it had moved to a new position, and had become much fainter. I watched it gradually, over a period of 2 - 3 minutes, grow fainter and fainter, until it vanished. It was also growing darker at the same time. It may have simply vanished into some clouds, but it was starting to grow dark outside, so it was hard to tell if there were clouds that it could have disappeared into. I took a picture with my cell phone camera-you can see something there, but it just looks like a blurry smudge. I took some pics with a digital camera, but unfortunately, i couldn&apos;t figure out how to turn the flash off. I also took some video with the digital camera, but by that time, the object had grown very faint, and it was growing dark outside.

I noticed from just above tree level a craft surrounded by lights emerging from just above tree top level.  At first it appeared to be a small triangular object decorated with lights such as a hang glider.  Then as more of the object drifted into view it appeared to be one huge object that was made up of three smaller triangular objects.  Almost as if three hang gliders were attached together making up a larger triangular object.  As more of it became visible and it drifted into full view I realized that it was not hang gliders due to the enormous size of it.  It was almost silent.  Perhaps a small engine sound was barely audible such as a putter or hum, but not sure about that.  Then just as if it realized that it had drifted into a populated area it stopped, hovered, then the lights blinked once.. twice... three times... then absolutely dark it went.

It is a floating helium filled raft like craft used by scientsts to drift over the rain forest and gather data and experiments.    This UFO was similar to that with lights.

It lit up the whole cloud telling me that whatever was creating this light was big. The light lasted about 4 seconds and turned off.

It was a triangle shaped craft with lights on the tips of the triangle. The lights were a mix of these colors, red, maroon, orange and yellow. The body of the craft was black. It came from the west and was moving east. It was large, it was bigger than any airplane or I had ever seen and it made a small humming noise. The size of the craft would have been he size of a baseball field. The craft was able to distort radio waves and cell phone frequencies. It caused a lot of static on radios and on my cell phone. There were chirping noises coming from my radio in the static. My cell phone had a lot of static. I was on the phone with a family member telling him about it and he may have seen it. It was able to mess with any electrical appliances that were left on. It had my watch on my hand going off the fritz. The second hand kept spinning forward and eventually stopped after it left. My camera even had static on it. I am mailing what I saw on the camera lcd screen. It looked like they were hailing me on my camera like on the show star trek. The weirdest part of the experience is the effect it had on my 5 cats. All five cats came into the room I was in. I even had one locked in my room and it opened the door to get out there. The cats circled me as I was gazing at the object. The object was slowly moving over my house and there was another flying object behind it and it was much smaller like a manmade aircraft chasing it. That aircraft did not make any sound and when it came close to the UFO it left for approximately one hour. I had sent in an earlier report and I mixed up the times by three hours.

I was driving down to Maidstone in Kent (in the evening around 7.30 pm approximately) and somewhere on the road after the Dartford tunnel I noticed a bright light like a star in the sky. The reason I especially noticed it was that it did not stay far away as a star would. It seemed to be staying in the same place all the time, so as I drove down the motorway and approached it I literally drove underneath whatever it was. This places the U.F.O.s to the west of the county and within just a few miles of the outskirts of London. As I looked up through the car windscreen I saw that the craft was very dark grey/black, triangular shaped, with lights at each corner. I could see that the underside of the object was divided into sections. I wondered if it could have been a Harrier or the &quot;invisible&quot; Stealth bomber or something but I didn&apos;t see any wheels hanging down, just the white lights at each corner of the triangle. When I have mentioned this to other people over the years they always ask if there were other vehicles on the motorway but I just cannot remember now - I was far more interested in what was directly above me!  It seemed to be hovering and there was absolutely no noise whatsoever. When I told my husband later about this he asked about the noise level. Ovbviously a normal aircraft would have been extremely noisy, especially as it seemed so close to the ground to me, but I definitely did not hear anything.  I got the impression that it was hovering. I see from your reports that other people have seen similar things far more recently which is why I decided to report my own sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There was no sound, and no blinking lights. I spotted it at once as I walked out my back door, facing south. It was moving steadily eastward and upward. It did not disappear over the horizon. It faded from view into the night sky at about 80 degrees SE (I think that is the correct measure). If one looked straight up, then south down to about 80 degrees, then west to about 40 degrees, that is where I first spotted it.

On 06-20-07 I had missed seeing the Shuttle/ISS, yet solely because of the clouds that night.Today (06-21-07), for locating purposes, I used references: One being NASA TV with the live recording of the actual shuttle orbital position, the other (which for good reasons should have been at my geographical location instead, but no more available at ESA) as given by esa.heavens-above.com/esa/iss_step2.asp?lat= &hellip; Marseille&amp;tz=CET because I found Marseille to be a place from where the Shuttle could still be seen around 11:09/11:10 pm CEST that night according to ESA.Given the good visibility of the moon and the other planets/stars indicated as well as their seemingly reasonable height over the horizon, I just hoped I could eventually tonight see the Shuttle/ISS just over the horizon, since I could reasonably figure out its course as shown on the &ldquo;sky map&rdquo; from ESA (for Marseille) being a course between the two &lsquo;lines&rsquo; Moon-Leo-Saturn-Venus and the horizon when seen from my place of observation.In the end, I was wrong due to lack of experience, ESA was right (it was in the shadow and/or too far down under my horizon), and so I didn&rsquo;t see what I had hoped for. Instead, at approx.11:10 pm (+/- 3 minutes) CEST I saw all of a sudden a steady bright light close to the right side of the moon, as big as and a little brighter than Venus at that moment, moving to the right faster than a commercial airplane (for which I took it at first; too big, too bright, seemingly too far away, no blinking lights!) for close to 4 seconds until it suddenly disappeared (shadow?) and never turned up again. I had the impression it was going down in a slight right turn towards the earth (shadow?).Its direction in more detail was when seen from my position: From close to the right moon surface towards the right (first horizontally) in a slightly changing direction (downward curvature) from like on a 16-min to an 18-min course (with moon as clockface), in the end with a slight even more downward (20-min) course when it disappeared as if switched off.

The duration of its appearance was close to 4 seconds. In terms of &lsquo;length&rsquo; of its course visible to me: It appeared out of the dark at little distance right of the moon&rsquo;s right curvature (where I was staring at) to continue as a bright light for a distance that I would describe as being half of the distance I could recognize between Saturn and Venus from my position at that moment, with approx. 80% of its initial length in a 17-min directional mode, the rest directed more downward.", "white orb/sphere moving across blue sky at a high rate of speed then changes directionWhile lying out in my backyard watching the clouds and planes overhead, I noticed a white orb/sphere moving in a west/northwest direction.

The time listed is exact.  Weather was sunny with some clouds. While waiting for golfers in front of us, and watching golfers behind us shoot to the green we noticed a dark, oval object in the sky. The color was nearly black with a tint of brown, no lights and no reflection from the sun.  The object was a good distance to us, fairly high in the sky. It was completely circular with no apparent wings or propulsion. We saw several low flying Jetliners from Logan Airport afterwards, and this object was much higher. It moved at a constant speed, remaining at the same altitude the entire time it was visible. I attempted to take a picture with my cell phone but I am sadly not well versed in using that feature. We pointed the object out to the golfers behind us on Hole 2, whom were just as mystified as ourselves. The object seemed to be more over northwest Melrose and Wakefield as Hole 3 runs south by southwest (I Believe per google maps), and we overlooked hole 2 to view the object. We lost sight of the object after 2 minutes behind a cloud. After seeing so many planes that day at different altitudes from just taking off to extremely high (35,000 FT), we both could tell this was no aircraft. The first debunking ideas after viewing the object that came to my mind were the following: Dark colored balloon, Blimp or or kite. I can rule out the blimp, as we saw the Hood Blimp returning from Boston from the Red Sox game that afternoon fly over us later that evening. The balloon is possible, but what is difficult is that a balloon would wobble with wind. This object stayed on-course and was unwaivering steady in its course of movement. Finally the kite theory is hard because it traveled such a distance (at least a mile) while we were viewing it.

I stepped outside for my normal check of the perimeter of the building, and I witnessed the same object as previously reported at that time and date. The sky was blue and clear, and I saw a bright silver object moving quickly at a very high altitude from East to West at about 80 degrees from the horizon. At first I thought it might be a high altitude military craft, or daytime satellite, but it abruptly stopped, and stayed in a stationary position. I retrieved a pair of 10x50mm binoculars from my car, and I was barely able to identify the object as what appeared to be a silver spinning cylinder. It was spinning very fast vertically, end over end, and was completely stationary. I asked a patient outside the clinic if she would confirm what I was seeing, and her response was, quote: &ldquo;What in the world is that???&rdquo;. The object was stationary for approximately 20 minutes, and at one point, a high flying (40,000ft?) commercial jetliner flew underneath, yet the altitude of this strange object was still much higher than the jetliner. I would venture to guess its altitude was on the order of 65,000+ft. To be able to distinguish it as a spinning cylinder at that altitude, leads me to think that it must have been huge. After 20min the spinning cylinder gained altitude and sped away at extreme speed to the North, until it quickly disappeared. Being an experienced amateur astronomer, I have seen quite a variety of objects both day and night. I have previously always been able to eventually identify and classify the objects as either spy satellites, the space station, space shuttle, weather balloons, or other man made aircraft, etc. The sighting and behavior of this object has bothered and bewildered me for years, and I am glad I finally found an appropriate place to tell my story, and confirm that it was witnessed by several other people.

As I slowed down, I looked in my rearview mirror, and I could see actual flashing red and blue lights, and I looked over my shoulder and saw them in the rear window. After a minute, I found a place where there was enough of a shoulder on the road to pull over. I pulled over and put the car in park, and then I noticed that there were no longer any flashing lights. I looked all around. There was no car behind me. I was completely alone on the road. I just sat there, wondering what that was all about. As I sat there, I replayed the incident in my mind. I could visualize the red and blue flashing lights as they appeared through my rear window. All of a sudden it occurred to me that there were no headlights. There had been no headlights below the red and blue flashing lights! I started to panic. In fact, I was just plain terrified at that point. I knew that something very out of the ordinary had just happened to me. I was so scared, I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. I grabbed my cell phone and called my husband, at home. I explained what had just happened, and he told me to put the car in drive and drive home fast. He was scared too. As I spoke to him, I tried to gather my thoughts. I tried to tell him all the tiny details of what had just happened, so I would remember it all. I was scared and confused, and felt like I needed to go through it all and figure it out. In doing so, I recalled distinctly that there had been no headlights. There was no flash of white light, as it would have appeared if a car had turned around and their headlights swung around in the turn. There was no indication of a car pulled over further behind me, although it was very dark and I may not have seen it if there was. Everything I recalled then and everything I recall now is just completely puzzling. Living near Camp Williams, in Eagle Mountain, had afforded us many opportunities to see military helicopters of all sorts. For a few minutes I thought that perhaps it might have been a helicopter, but I have been below low flying helicopters before, and I know what that sounds like. I was even buzzed by a low flying Blackhawk one night as my husband and I drove down the highway, so I know how it sounds when one is close. The thing that kept coming back to me as I recalled the bizarre occurrences of that evening is that there was no sound. As close as those lights were to my vehicle, I know I would have heard the sound, if it had been a helicopter. It was close enough that I saw the source of the flashing lights in both my rearview mirror and in my rear window. Whatever it was, it was very low to the ground and very close to my car. I have always held a neutral position regarding the ideas of extra-terrestrials and UFOs. I have neither believed, nor disbelieved in them. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed watching sci-fi shows, but it was always just silly fun to me. I&rsquo;ve never really considered myself a &ldquo;believer&rdquo;. That night my skepticism really dropped to an all-time low. I&rsquo;m still not really what you would call a &ldquo;believer&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m a great deal closer to it since then.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Roadside triangular UFO sighting resulting in missing time.(This is a follow-up to a report I had submitted previously) A friend and I observed what appeared to be a triangular shaped craft as we traveled south on Highway 52 near Mt. Airy, NC. At first, I thought that we were approaching some kind of lit up construction site near the treeline on the opposite side of the highway. I was reaching across from the passenger seat adjusting the radio when I noticed this anomaly. The lights looked three dimensional, for lack of a better description. When I realized that the lights were attached to an object and actually gaining altitude, I directed my friend&apos;s (the driver) attention to that direction. We both kept asking each other what this thing was that we were watching. The underside of the object had a white light on each corner and a bigger, very bright light in the center shining on the ground below. As the object slowly and deliberately rose above the treeline, the light in the center went out. The remaining three lights, which had been rotating clockwise while the object ascended, came to a stop. Then the lights slowly rotated about a half of a revolution counter-clockwise and cocked up at an angle simultaneously, which put the lights facing almost directly at our passing car. After a brief pause, the object silently &apos;blinked&apos; out of the atmosphere in a split second, zig-zagging in what seemed like thousands of small straight lines. We soon noticed that no traffic was visible in either direction during/after the sighting, which was eerily improbable on this busy four lane highway at that time. The FM radio, which had suddenly failed just prior to the sighting, then started working again (this gave us a scare because I had inadvertantly turned the volume all the way up in my troubleshooting effort). Much to our relief, the normal amount of oncoming traffic soon resumed in the northbound lanes, although we did not see any headlights behind us in the southbound lanes the rest of the 20+ miles to our exit - we also looked northward from the bridge while crossing back over the highway after exiting and could not see any headlights approaching. We were very intrigued by what we had experienced as one might expect. Upon reaching our destination, we came to a very disturbing realization, however. The thirty minute trip, which we had made many times before, had taken us almost FOUR HOURS. There was absolutely no explanation for the missing time and we were totally dumbfounded. The only thing that we could figure was that since we were almost directly under the UFO,  we must have been affected by its energy field. That would also explain the lack of continuity in the flow of traffic, we surmised.", "Silent, Fast moving Disc with color changing glow, over Army Training Base, not aircraft.After Basic Training in the Army I was sent to Fort Lee, Virginia for my job training school. I remember this all because I was turning 21 and was keeping a daily notebook at the time. One morning while standing at attention in formation, something made me look up and to my right. I noticed what looked to me like a large disc with a multi-colored glow about it. This was not a normal disc, it was somewhat elongated in the middle. It had a glow that appeared to be steady, only the glow around it seemed to be changing in color. The outer glow was not one color at any time, however, it seemed to be many colors at once. I observed it as it crossed the crystal clear winter sky going from my right to my left. I can&apos;t remember the direction, however, it took only about eight seconds to cross the sky. At that time I looked at the guys on both sides of me and whispered to them asking if they had seen it. Since we were at attention, they seemed annoyed at my asking. No one else seemed to see the object and I never asked again. Our Platoon Sargent then began talking and I stood still at attention without looking for the object again. When I returned to the building, I drew a sketch in my notebook, however, the sketch was stolen along with other personal item after I left the Army. The sky was so black, and the object so bright that I never forgot this sighting. It flew in a straight line and at a high rate of speed. My guess would be that it was at about 20,000 feet. The object was silent and the base was very quiet at 5 AM. This was not from a jet and flew to straight to be a shooting star. I could clearly see the object within the colorful glow around it. My view of it was as if looking at the side of a disc, not the bottom. The object may have been a long cylinder with rounded ends that came to a slight point, like a side view of a disc with an elongated center. No further action by me and did not hear anything about it as girl chasing was most on my mind at the time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Driving into work in Frisco, TX on Spring Creek Parkway this morning at around 8:20 AM something caught my eye in the sky.  There were no clouds in the sky and was completely sunny.

They were moving faster than I have ever seen anything in the sky move.  As I continued to watch them for around 8 seconds or so they vanished.", "Oval-shaped white object flew across north Oklahoma City and disappeared.  Helicopter appeared to look for it seconds after it vanished.Hello, Was idly staring out my fifth-floor window overlooking downtown Oklahoma City looking north when a white object that appeared to be round was zipping across the city from west to east.  It went behind an apartment building and emerged on the other side and then disappeared in front of a cloud.Then, about 15 seconds later, I see a black-colored helicopter come in from the east and stop at the very spot where this object had vanished. It hovered there for about 20 seconds and then went back east and out of my line of vision.One thing about this object is that it seemed to be revolving on its axis, because it would go white and gray and white again. Very strange.I would add that two days earlier, around the same time, I was 20 miles south in Norman, Oklahoma having lunch with my father-in-law, when I saw a bright object of similar size traveling in much the same fashion.  The difference was is that it seemed to leave a short &quot;exhaust&quot; trail or something behind it before disappearing in front of a cloud. I should also note that Tinker AFB is not far away from both sighting locations.", "No sound and vary low flyingA power outatge in south florida found my son and I sitting on the front porch he happened to see a shooting star and layed on his back on the sidewalk to maybe see another.Just then he says daddy whats that and points up at the sky,  I walked off the porch and looked at what he is pointing at, and saw 5 or 6 glowing round disks flying in a v shape patteren it may have been one big one we could not tell it was vary low we think about 200 feet it made no sound at all.Allso if you were not looking up it could have flown buy without noticing it.((NUFORC Note:  We do not understand why the witness does not indicate a time and date for the alleged event.

Also wish to state that I am not drawing conclusions as to what I saw, but I am documenting this so that other witnesses may corroborate with my account.On my way back to my car after work, I turned my head skyward briefly. The night was a little cloudy but some stars were viewable above me. I focused in on one of the fainter stars (I am not into astronomy &ndash; star is a dim orange colour in the high vertical east bound sky of the ACT) and a shooting star happened to fly pass. This did not amaze me much, as I recall seeing what really was a shooting star just a few nights earlier outside my house. What did amaze me is that this object, while appearing to have the same relative looking speed of a shooting star, continued to remain in view without the characteristic fadeout of a shooting star. This suggested to me that the object is upper atmosphere, possibly higher.My amazement ended and astonishment began when a second shooting star like object tailed, accelerated and caught up to the original object. The second object moved in on the first object and produced the trajectory of a side-facing parabola &ndash; something like stunt pilots would execute. The first object then circled around at a very high speed in a wide arc, but only completed about ninety percent of the circular turn.As I was focusing on the sudden &ndash; and frankly mind boggling &ndash; acrobatics of the first object, I lost sight of the second. The first object disappeared in its incomplete turn.The whole experience felt like about ten seconds all up.I have no idea what I saw, but I can tell you it was no shooting star.Yes Canberra has an airport in the vicinity of my eastward vantage, but this event was right above me and these objects were EXTREMLY high. No way it was the air force, balloons etc and I don&rsquo;t know much about satellites or space stations, but I would guess they don&rsquo;t move like that.The only other likelihood I can think of is very high altitude lightning, asteroid collision or maybe even aurora, but again I know nothing about these subject areas. I also discount the possibility of my tired condition resulting in eye floaters, simply because these were bright objects. To test this, after I arrived home, I tried staring at dark surfaces, but my eyes were not producing any bright artefacts.The objects in question were just dots but the way they moved! The trajectory crossover and turn did not seem natural.Can anyone who witnessed this event please confirm. This has certainly messed up my scepticism. I am trying to register an account on the website ATS, but my password doesn&rsquo;t seem to come through. I will keep trying. This needs to get out hence the email.I do however choose to remain anonymous to protect my professional reputation.", "round circle with beam, the beam shot around down the street cousin, sister friend and i saw it  happend 3 times since 2004i was watching t.v. and my sister comes in saying &quot;theres a bunch of lights in the sky&quot; i go and look and theres about 9 lights in the sky huvering abouve a shopping center down the street it looked like strobe lights so i call my friend who lives just acroos the street from it he said there were no strobe lights in the ground they were round at the top and there were beems going down but it seemed like the beem was conected to the roung top((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I began to watch what i thought was a plane in the eastern sky. It had different colored lights that were flashing(red, blue, yellow and green) When I tried to determine direction of flight I noticed that it was stationary for the most part, but then it would make sudden erratic movements in all different directions. I thought I must be seeing things, so I waited for my husband to come out.When he cane out to the deck I asked him if he saw the &quot;plane&quot; to the east. When he saw it I asked him to watch it for a minute. He flies planes, so I figured he could explain what it was I was seeing. After watching it for a few minutes he asked me to bring him his binoculars so he could get a better look. By this time our daughter wanted to know what we were looking at.We pointed out the lights to her, and by this time the lights were changing shape too, and we all saw what appeared to be colored &quot;orbs?&quot; shooting off sporatically in different directions.We noticed that there appeared to be a simular light formation on the horizon, also in the east, and another to the north.A friend who lives not far called about this time and asked what I was doing, I told her I was watching a ufo, she laughed, accused me of being on drugs, but went outside to see this ufo. I told her to look east, and find the plane, which she did, and I told her to just watch it. Her daughter came outside with her, and then her son too. This is when we all saw a flash in the sky, like  lightening lights up the sky, with out thunder, but very bright for just an instant.We watched this light show for almost an hour before the main light formation seemed to be splitting into two sections, first blue then red, but the whole time getting farther and farther apart until we couldnt see them any longer.We saw planes flying last night too, but it was almost like they were unaware of the light formation, which is strange since we live not too far from a military airbase.Then an hour or so later, we experienced power outages and power surges lasting only a few seconds, but enough to cause a blow out of surge protector for one of our computers. Dont know that it was related at all, just kind of coincidental.", "...a flying circular disk with bright lights on the bottom outer rim.   It was about 6-20 feet in diameter, spinning and hoveringAt about 10:30pm PST, my girlfriend and I were driving home from dinner about 5 miles away from our residence.  On the way home, I noticed a flying circular disk with bright lights on the bottom outer rim.   It was about 6-20 feet in diameter, spinning and hovering from side to side, less than 50 yards from the ground.  I was about 100 yards from the object when I noticed it and I froze.  My girlfriend asked me what was wrong, and I told her to turn around at the next street after we had passed it.  As we drove up the hill, I got a closer look and saw that there was blue and red lights spinning around the outer rim at about 1 revolution every 5 seconds.  I told my girlfriend to make a right into the &quot;Strawberry Farms Golf Course&quot; to take a closer look, but she refused and we had to drive another mile before we could take another glimpse at it.  When we returned, the object had flown about 1/2 a mile away on top of a hill, and was very hard to spot.  I was going to take a picture, but could not get a clear shot from a moving vehicle, especially with a camera phone.", "Bright flickering light traveling in a zig zag pattern and eventually having a burst of speed and disappearing.I was outside and noticed a plane flying south and then noticed there was an object coming north that seemed to be headed for the same path. The plane then turned off the path.   The object was a bright light flickering at times and white and green.  It was probably about two times the size of the brightest star I have seen.  It flickered like a sparkler does.  I ran into the house and called my daughter and wife out to observe, and it was still there.  The object was very slowly traveling north in a random zig zag pattern and at times appeared to be hanging in the sky.  During the time I watched, the object seemed to drop something.  It was like bits of red fire.  After about a minute or two it had a speed burst and then was totally gone.   I have never seen anything like this in my 47 years.  I still have no clue as to what it was, but I know it was nothing I have seen before.", "Formation of  balls of light travelling across the sky, one behind the other, early in 1997.I went out to feed the horse at about 6 or 7 pm - Feb.? 14? 1997 - and looked up to the sky. It was a cripsy clear calm night with cotton ball clouds. I could see the stars behind the clouds. The lights of the city were slightly illuminating the clouds.Suddenly I saw one ball of light pass above the clouds moving in a South-Westerly maybe more Southerly direction. It looked odd so I kept watching. Then another ball of light exactly the same size and distance moved the same direction following the first, completely silent. I kept watching and there was another and another. I ran in to get my video camera and started taping this. There were several more. They seemed to be spaced the same distance apart and travelling the same rate of speed, like in some kind of formation, though the patches of clouds made it difficult to be exact.My first thought was that they were satellites, but then do satellites travel in this manner? I&apos;ve seen many satellites before, but these were closer, or a lot larger-if they were out in space! These balls of light were about the size of a small green pea if you held it in-between your forefinger and thumb in an out-stretched arm. I think I counted about seven to ten seconds between each ball of light. Also, they just seemed too perfect for shooting stars - and there were too many of them.I saved the tape it&apos;s on (I hope!) Though I only got the last few of the formation on tape. I have other family 8mm tapes I&apos;ve been meaning to go through to put on disc. Hopefully, I&apos;ll find this footage.

PD))", "Strange light  attracting smaller lights of eradict movements during lighting and thunder storm sky empty of  commercial aircraftAround 22:00 here in Gresham, Oregon we experienced a lighting and thunder storm, it began approximately around 21:00. This storm was announced in the morning news to be headed into the coastal regions from the pacific ocean and perhaps would reach Portland in the evening. Me and my boyfriend had just finished watching a movie and we decided to go outside and watch the lighting for a moment. Thunder was also heard after the lighting. As we watched the lighting our attention became focused to the southeastern sky where we could view the brightest lighting strikes. To right of these strikes was what we believed to be a bright star, however while viewing this lighting we noticed that this bright star began to bob up and down,move quickly to the right of the lighting away from the eastern sky and towards the southern. We live in close proximity of the flight path of commercial airliners heading for landing at the pdx airport. Suddenly many planes headed for landing,these planes were only about 5 to 8 minutes apart. Thinking this was due to the storm we continued to watch the sky for more incoming planes. We however not only viewed more planes, but more smaller lights we had previously supposed as fixed stars dart around the night sky. We kept our attention focused on the first bright object. My boyfriend said that he could see the smaller objects heading in collision with the bright object, i could not see this because my eyes are not as sharp, however upon looking through some binoculars i viewed smaller objects flying eradically around the larger one and then quickly disappearing as if going inside the large one. The large Object remained the same size while this continued. Alarmed, but curious we continued to observe this unsual sight, the lighting and quickly descending commercial aircraft. After about half an hour the sky became clear of aircraft. The lighting continued to flash all around, but its main focus point was still in the southeast and close to the object, it was very bright l! ighting seeming to be concentrated in this area. There were no sounds of thunder with this lighting in the southeast and it seemed to hit the same spot over and over, i realized this because it was in between two trees of our neighborhood each time. This seemed very strange to me because i&apos;ve never seen lighting crash over and over again in almost exactly the same spot. The behavior of the smaller objects continued on their path towards the brighter one. The brighter object remained stationary in the south. Clear of aircraft we witnessed a military fighter jet appear from the east where the commercial aircraft came from. I am not sure the exact model of the jet but i know the difference between planes and jets. this jet turned towards the south and flew under the bright object. The ufo did not move what so ever and we got the impression that it was much to high for the jet to even come close to reaching. The jet flew under the ufo and then turned northwestern towards the airport or north of it. We viewed another jet plane a couple minutes after this come from the northwestern sky and do a similar flight pattern under the ufo in the south, i dont believe this was the same jet turning around but i can&apos;t be sure. Clouds began to block our view of the ufo for several minutes, but between the breaks of cloud cover we viewed it continuing to do the same behavior of assimulating these smaller objects. I don&apos;t know the number of these smaller ufos but the night sky seemed to be teeming with them. Neither me nor my boyfriend have ever witnessed a sight so marveling and transfixing. He used to work at the pdx airport and said he never seen anything even remotely close to the way this object behaved. The sky after about an hour was still void of commercial aircraft. The clouds blocked our view for some time and the lighting died away. After about another 30 minutes the sky began to clear in the south and the object was gone. Still the sky was quiet of aircraft. After about 10 to 15 minutes we finally viewed a plane in the ! sky comi ng from the south turning east and then west towards pdx, and then another from the east. They were in no hurry like the previous ones, and soon the flight path resumed to normal with planes.

It was a Friday night in February 2007 when I received a call from my father about something very bizarre going on above their garden.  He had walked up to the fenced garden area to check on a recently acquired mare, which had attained a bad leg injury and was rumored to be pregnant.  He was very frightened to see translucent orbs approximately four feet in diameter circling 10-30 feet above the mare.  He described the appearance as :lighted fog.&quot;  According to him there were a large number of these orbs &quot;dancing around,&quot; which gave him the appearance of intelligence rather than simply moving in a random fashion. After he started his truck one of the orbs moved onto the hood area, which immediately cut the lights off, as well as the engine.  At this point the traveled a hundred yards or so on foot to their dwelling.My mother stepped out on their front porch and was so frightened by what she saw through the bare trees that she refused to go any closer.   At this point I received the call from my father.  I called a neighbor to witness the scene to ensure nothing was medically wrong with them.  He brought a camcorder and attempted to record the orbs, which had risen to a couple hundred feet at this time.  He tried to use his cell phone and the battery suddenly went dead and every time he would raise the camcorder to record the orbs then they would all clump together and shoot off at lightening speed out of sight.  Within a short period of time they would return, expand and do the same thing as before.  The movement reported was remarkable and comparable to a kaleidoscope.There were several other witnesses who observed this phenomenon from 3-20 miles away.  However these witnesses observed the lights at high altitude and my father was the only one that I am aware of who noticed the occurrence at such a close distance. He is an extremely reliable source although I will not disclose further information so he can remain anonymous. They observed the phenomenon from approximately 8:30 to 10:30 pm on a Friday evening.

While filling it I stood facing north so that I was not looking directly into the very bright sun to my left (West). I started looking up into the northern sky when I noticed an object that was stationary and gleaming in the very bright sun and was at the altitude of normal airliners. After I completed my honeydew chores and rolling up the hose, which took about 15 minutes in total I again looked for the object and I found it was still in the very same spot including that it was still stationary and apparently had not moved. I called for my wife thru our patio door and asked her to come and look at some object and tell me what she thought. I pointed to it and she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that is, but it is not moving at all and maybe it is a big balloon&rdquo;.

I then gave the binoculars to my wife and said, &ldquo;You got to take a look at this&rdquo;. Well, to say we were both astonished is an understatement. The object remained stationary for another 25-30 minutes and then started moving directly north at a very slow pace and in fact so slow that I initially thought it had stopped moving again. As the object moved northerly the red-silver glow was more apparent and the greenish hue totally disappeared.

The lights would make a small turn and go back into the center of the &apos;wheel&apos;. When the lights would &apos;bump&apos; (in the center) they would stay lit.  It was absolutely nothing like a search light. From the ground using the naked eye, it appeared that the lights were about 4 -5 feet in diameter.

There was no sound at all.", "not realthis was taken from a flight simulator and is rediculouls for you to post it&apos;", "Strange lights at first thought to be shooting stars.A few nights ago I awoke from a particularly bad case of sleep paralysis around 3am when I heard the sound of several neighborhood dogs barking, something was obviously disturbing them. This lead me to look out my bedroom window to investigate. I then saw what at first appeared to be shooting stars in the sky. While I was wondering why there were so many of them or why they were so frequent, i then realized they were not shooting stars at all.These objects would fly one direction, then suddenly turn in another. Some would hover still for a few seconds. Every now and then I&apos;d see one &quot;flash&quot; then shoot off in a direction at incredible speed. I must point out that these objects did seem to be flying rather randomly. In fact, I later joked to my girlfriend &quot;if they were aliens, well they were obviously driving drunk&quot;. The lights do however seem to occasionally &quot;interact&quot; with one another, flying near to each other, hovering then flying away. These lights were visible outside my window until I fell asleep at 6am.For the most part I heard no sound connected with the objects, although I did often hear the sound of helicopters - far more frequently then i would normally in my area. I saw a helicopter only once, it did match the description of &quot;black helicopters&quot; that I have read.Being somewhat of a skeptic, as well as being aware of the effects of sleep paralysis - I at first put off these lights to being hypnagognic hallucination. This explanation, however was proven wrong when tonight I saw the same thing, also shortly after 3am. This time my sighting was not following sleep and my girlfriend was over and saw them too.Also, tonight at one point I saw a much larger and much brighter light. This light suddenly appeared in the sky, and then moved slowly to the left. I called in my girlfriend who saw it and became rather frightened. I turned to comfort her and upon me turning back, it was gone. These lights are visible outside my window now.I am aware many times alien abductions have been explained away as sleep paralysis. The fact that I had sleep paralysis before my first time witnessing these lights has me wondering if the two are in fact connected somehow.

I looked back at the road and looked up again thinking that I had never seen a bird able to keep afloat for that amount of time without utilizing its wings. As I stared longer I realized it was not a bird at all. In fact it was something that I could not explain. I seem to want to compare it to a submarine that was flying. Or maybe a missile, due to its shape. It was black and long and thin, similar to a cigar. It seemed to have small fins sticking out of its sides. Again I was on my motorcycle and so I could not here any sounds, nor did I see any lights. Its movement was not that of a rocket, because it did not move in a linear manner. I would liken its movement to someone holding it on a string and pulling it up and down, and if it weren&rsquo;t for the height of the object in the sky, roughly 500 feet, and location, over a heavily wooded area, I would swear someone was holding it up on a fishing line. It slowly moved north and soon was out of my view.

Unfortunately.... there was a report on CNN that the International Space Station could be seen with the naked eye that week at certain times in N. America.

The lights were much brighter than an airplane, and they were lower than an airplane would fly and they also made a loud humming sound, much unlike an airplane. After about a minute or two the next one followed the same pattern and flew off to the left, the other two had stopped and were once again stationary. A few minutes later the third one also flew off to our left. We got a better look at it and we saw yellow, blue and red lights flashing. in the shape not similar to an airplane.

The abductee was about 22 years old at the time. He told the story to another person approximately in 1965, who first recounted it to me about two years ago.It is of high interest because the abductee apparently was able to remember the event in extreme detail. He worked as an outside salesman at the time of the abduction event, perhaps the reason he was not noticed as missing by person who knew him.The abductee said he was missing for three days. He described the abductors as being small &quot;people&quot; with large heads and large eyes. He considered them to be performing &quot;medical experiments&quot; on him. Evidently, he believed the abductors to be able to communicate telepathically, and reported that they conveyed to him that they would be contacting him again every 10 or 15 years.The abductee told the person who reported this story to me that his father owned a drugstore chain in San Francisco. Recently, my source talked to me again about this story, and recalled that he said that his family attended Temple Baptist Church in San Francisco. Evidently, he got married at Temple Baptist Church about in 1966.He was described as being of medium height and slim build, and a Scandanavian ethnic type with blond hair.I am not personally in a position to investigate this story since I do not live in the San Francisco Bay Area anymore or in California at all, but I think a good investigator could make quick work of finding out who this person was.

We looked up to see a UH-1 on a low flight path. As we watched it the helicopter changed its flight course from due south directly toward us, southwest. It flew over the power lines and osprey nesting poles to right over us, about 300ft above us, and hovered.  The noise was disturbing, to us, and to the wildlife there abouts.  I was angry at first, then a bit intimidated, as, upon viewing the craft through my binoculars, getting a very close look, I noticed there were absolutely no markings on this very dark green UH-1, only 3 white strobe lights, one on the top, one on the bottom, and one on the tail rotor.  No other lights or markings were on it. The cockpit windows were closed and blacked out so no one could see the pilots inside.  The doors were all closed.

Jack Reed, D-RI.  I sent him an email on that same day asking him to find out who was piloting this chopper and why there were no markings on it.  On July 19th, 2007, I received a written letter from Sen. Reed informing me that he had contacted Maj.Gen. Bray of the RI National Guard and that the general&apos;s letter to him was enclosed.  Also, that if I had any more questions regarding this incident to contact David Foehr at his RI office.  I read the response letter from Gen. Bray to Sen. Reed.  It was vague, saying that on that weekend three UH-60 (no UH-1s) helicopters were dispatched to Indiantown Gap Military Reservation in PA for training.  He also stated that the Army Aviation Support Facility at Quonset Point in N.Kingstown, the home of the Air wing of the Guard, &quot;did not recieve any inquiries concerning operations conducted during the period of May 4-6, 2007.&quot;  What that meant I have no idea...again, vague.  He went on to state that the RI National Guard conducts flight operations on a routine basis within RI and that the UH-1 and UH-60 helicopters that they use are &quot;affixed with U.S. Army markings.&quot;  Therefore, this rouge unmarked UH-1  was not from the RI Army National Guard.  Then, the question is, where did it come from and why did it fly where and in the manner seen by me and my girlfriend? I called back to Sen. Reed&apos;s office in RI and spoke with one his male office people.  I explained the reason for my call.  He became nervous, and said, please hold on, I am transfering your call to Washinton, D.C.  After several minutes an official sounding man answered the phone without giving his name and wanted to know what I wanted.  I had already given my name and address to the RI office.  I asked who he was and he would only say his name was &quot;Kevin&quot; and did not want to give me his last name.  He said he worked for Sen. Reed.  I explained the reason for my call again to him.  He told, rather non-sensically, to call Maj.Gen. Bray directly and ask him about this UH-1.  I said Sen Reed has already gotten a written response from the General, of which I have a copy, so why am I asked to call the General myself.  Again, he was vague, but said it would be quicker if I called the General myself, assuming the General would even talk to me.  He implied that maybe this time I would get a direct answer since Sen. Reed&apos;s new inquiry would take time.  I laughed to myself, said, &quot;ok&quot; and hung up.  I did not have Gen. Bray&apos;s phone number but the number for a contact person, LTC Habersham of the RI Air National Guard, would be the one to talk to.  Apparently, Gen. Bray and Sen. Reed want to distance themselves from any prying questions.  Why all this secrecy, I ask myself.  I call LTC Habersham yesterday, July 19, 2007.  A message on his machine said he was away on TDY training in PA and would not be back for a week.  He left his cell phone to call him. I did, left a message as to who I was and why I was calling.  A while later, when I did not have my phone near me, he did indeed call me back, saying that he would call me when he got back from TDY as he was very busy at this time.  Fair enough.  That&apos;s where this incident lies at this time.  Whether there is any connection  to the secrecy, as I perceive it, to the silent, gliding UFO I witnessed fly over the Jamestown Bridge and hover over the Nat&apos;l Guard HQ at Quo! nset Poi nt last month (reported to NUFORC) I don&apos;t know.  Thought you might be interested. By the way, I am a Vietnam Army combat vet who has flown on the &quot;hueys&quot; and have never seen one without military or some kind of markings/insignia.", "Bright stationary light in Northern sky.About 10:30 PM I was sitting on my deck observing Venus in the Western sky. With peripheral vision light from the north caught my right eye&rsquo;s attention. I immediately turned to the north and observed a bright object almost due north and about halfway up in the sky. Being an amateur astronomer I knew there was no star at that location. The magnitude of the light was similar to Venus and about half the size. It remained stationary. I observed it for about 5-10 seconds then it faded out. It had a very star like appearance.

Facing the west of my house, my wife, kids and me were getting ready to go inside after expending some time at my mom&apos;s.  Lately I&apos;ve been interested in the UFO phenomena, so I pay attention to the sky more now than before. I&apos;ve spotted a glowing red light at about 45 degrees in front of my house, what looked like a plane flying in our direction but after a closer observation realized it was just one light and not two, or any blinking light at all, like planes normally have.  I told my oldest son it was a helicopter but the light never changes size and now it looked like it was going up and not towards us.  My son suggested a rocket but we normally see the shuttle take off from our back yard facing the Kennedy Space Center east of Saint Cloud, FL.  Everyone went inside and I stayed to watch what was up with this light.  The glowing light was like the tail of a rocket but without the smoky trail.  I thought, I also saw a blinking white like near the object twice.  It was obvious it was neither an airplane nor helicopter.  It was going straight up and then it was turning right, but not in a wide turn.  It was turning right sharply but slow and it went thru a cloud making it glow as it passed thru.

I reside in Louisville, and frequently visit said friend as we have a 20 plus year friendship.  The day was fairly mundane and customary of the visits- on this particular day we were having a cookout to celebrate the holiday.   My friends brother of which Im also closely acquainted,  had also arrived and was assisting us with preparing the food.We were standing in a group in the patio area of my friends apartment, when for no particular reason I happened to glance upward facing East.  Immediately I viewed an object which was instantly unusual and atypical to me.  I called it to the attention of my friends.  For the next several minutes we observed this object in silence, then I suggested my friend go retrieve his binoculars.  Roughly 2 minutes later my friend appeared outside again with the binoculars and each of us in turn observed the object more closely through the binoculars.  This had the effect of enhancing the unusual nature of what we were witnessing.The weather that day was partly cloudy with a storm approaching from the west.  We were each facing east where visibility was clear.  It was approximately 5:30 in the afternoon and the sky was a crisp blue where visible to the east.  A bank of thin clouds were immediately overhead.The object we were viewing was a very stark black of perfectly square configuration.  The object had no surface features, no protrusions, no reflectivity and no oscillation.  The was no sound accompanying the object.  Upon first viewing the object it was roughly 25 degrees from the horizon and stationary.  As soon as I first viewed the object, it began ascending along a single vector straight upward at a very slow leisurely pace.  The object maintained it&apos;s relative configuration, size, speed of ascension, and color value the entire duration of the sighting and ascended until it dissapeared behind the above cloud bank.  With my arm outstretched the object would have been approximately the size of my forefinger nail.   As the object was against the backdrop of the sky there was no frame of reference to accurately determine distance or relative size of the object.   If I were to make a presumption based on my own depth perception of the objects spatial orientation it appeared to be closer rather than further, less than 2 miles away, making it roughly the size of an automobile.The object was in clear view long enough for a discussion during the sighting on what it clearly was not.  An entire gambit of possible explanations was dismissed as we were all viewing the object.  The object was clearly not an aircraft of conventional configuration, balloon, parasail, garbage bag, insect, bird, toy, kite,  or illusory figment.   This was a tangible, solid object that possessed mass and weight.I immediately contacted 911 and was instructed to contact New Albany or Jeffersonville police department, of which I did neither as the event was over and the object was no longer visible.   Additionally I contacted Louisville international airport and spoke with the radar operator.  The operator indicated there was nothing unusual in the sky over southern Indiana.The event left me disturbed and confounded.   I have a background in Psychology and I am fully aware of the many mechanisms within the human mind that can create potential misinterpretations of visual stimuli.The irony is while observing this object I distinctly recall all of these formal concepts raced through my mind it seemed,  and none of these were satisfactory to me.  Remotely.It is one thing to read about unexplained aerial phenomenon over the years, but to actually witness something that defies frame of reference or educational background  is quite startling.  I consider myself a fairly learned and educated individual with a working knowledge of meteorology, astronomy, physics, military aircraft, and human perception, yet the object I witnessed defied all of these schools of thought and rationale.  I am the type of person that doesn&apos;t enjoy mysteries and despite researching, careful contemplation, review, and even soul-searching, I never discovered an explanation that satisfies what I and my friends witnessed. A square object is not even aerodynamic, to say nothing of the stark black appearance of the object.I am not prepared to say what I viewed was of extraterrestrial origin, yet at the same time I am prepared to say what I viewed does not belong in the sky  over a major metropolitan area in broad daylight for all the world to see.  There was a strange eerie stillness to the whole event.To my knowledge no one else viewed this object with the exception of the  three of us, despite our close proximity to Interstate 65 which runs through southern Indiana and Louisville Ky. I would be quite curious if there was anyone else that happened to view this object that day.  To be perfectly honest, I would be relieved if it were infact mundane and simply mis-identified.", "There were many people in Cole county and surrounding counties that seen the object also.I was listening to the scanner when the first report came into the Cole County Sherrifs Office (This dispatch was called Jeff Central) about a bright light in the southeastern part of Russellville. Deputies were dispatched to the area, I believe there were 2 deputies that arrived and called back into the dispatch operator and said they had a confirmed sighting of something but was not sure of what it was. They thought it was a joke at first but quickly found out it wasn&apos;t. They had dispatch call the Air force to see if they had any air craft in the area and to see if they had anything on radar, they said they had no air craft in the area and showed nothing on their radars. The deputies followed it for a long time and listening to them on the scanner i could tell they were shaken up a bit, you could here it in their voices. Nothing was ever printed in the paper or reported as far as I know. I do remember that one deputy sayng that he had never seen lights like that before and that the lights changed colors from time to time. He had gotten within a hundred feet of the object and also said it was not making any noise.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I looked and said,it&apos;s a plane while I served a customer.The next car pulled up for p/u for groceries.The stranger said look,it&apos;s not moving-I looked and said -it&apos;s a helicopter.I finished the second car and again this fellow bothered me.

I replied time travellers! We stayed together and look all around in the skies.After 10 minutes we went back to work.The store would be closing at 10:00pm,as it must have been 9:15pm at that point.Then I heard a whooshing sound directly above moving across to the east.My co-worker friend screamed across the parking lot and say-did you hear that !

There was no wind and visibility was extreme clear. There were stars out in the background nothing in the sky that would obscure visibility. There were also a few dissapating Con Trails at higher altitudes. The best description I can offer is that it looked very much like the image I found depicted on the top of this page.  It was a &quot;V&quot; shaped set of low intensity lights with 1 at the point, and 4 or 5 on each leg of a symmetrical shaped &quot;V&quot;. It disapeared after about 4 seconds which was not obscured by any ground objects or the horizon.  What confused me is that there was no sound, and that there was plenty of background light which would provide a view of the vehicle the lights were a part of, and there was nothing. It was simply a formation of low intensity lights, shaped in an angle that no aircraft (commercial or military) I know of.  For the record... I&apos;m not a believer in extra terrestial life or aliens from another planet. I&apos;ve also seen plenty of waterfowl formations at night and can assure you that idea has no merit in my opinion.

One speculation is that during its very bright phase right overhead the object may have been experiencing some kind of reentry (or entry) glow/burn while descending through the upper atmosphere although cannot claim to have seen have seen that before so do not know. In fact first impression was that it was already in the upper atmosphere and for some reason unclear, the object may have been intentionally many magnitudes brighter and thusly largely then suddenly dimming to (distant observer size) of a slightly faster moving satellite (similar in observation size to most stars observable on a clear night (cloudless.)  It definitely dimmed down practically went overhead of both witnesses.  The earlier reported light descending over Kirkland was mentioned to a taxi driver who said that she had seen something similar earlier over the freeway in the Kirkland vicinity.  Also would like to report (which uncannily had forgotten until reminded) about a year or so before, a daylight sighting at 3:55pm over Volunteer Park, Seattle, on a clear sunny day a bright star like object stationed directly over head above Fifteenth Avenue East and East Republican (observed by several passers by and small business owner.  The object remained overhead for it seemed like maybe a dozen minutes. Most said it appeared unusual but soon lost interest and thought it may have been a daytime bright planet sighting and went about their way.  However (this observer) witnessed the bright silvery object eventually proceed to move slowly in a southerly direction and therefore walked several blocks in order to track the object as it passed above Fifteenth Avenue East, directly over the Aquarian Foundation Spiritualist Medium Church and the Safeway store next to it.  Did not report this to the members there fixing their church wall and as they were bust on ladders (although in retrospect maybe should have as they profess an interest in non terrestrial entities themselves).  The silvery slow moving bright sphere carried on slowly southwards toward South Seattle seemingly in no hurry whatsoever and making no effort to cloak itself in any way and was very clear from a third floor veranda until it was eventually to far gone over south Seattle to continue to maintain observation of the bright silvery (perhaps a very slight blue tint) object which remained silent.  Have speculated that if these were indeed human experimental vehicles, they are beyond current understanding of the general population.  If heretofore vessels were of a non terrestrial intelligent nature then they were making no attempt to cloak or stealth themselves) possibly wishing to be observed at that moment in time. Also have considered that if they are of say a &quot;galactic park ranger&quot; or scientific observer mission, they may be scanning the area with advanced technology to determine possible near future earthquake or volcanic activity in the Pacific Northwest region.  Another possible speculation is that such objects may have some form of mind link ability and may make themselves known to certain individuals and groups for some unknown reason.  Oh, almost forgot to mention about a week ago while riding on a bus across 520 bridge from Seattle to Kirkland, two spherical ! dark obj ects hovering over the exclusive beach front area, one above the other perhaps hundreds of feet, possibly over the Medina area.  No one on the bus seemed to say or not anything and did not raise alarm by asking others what they might be.  They just seemed to be hanging in the air only hundreds of feet above the area (possibly close to where a well known soft ware developer may reside.)  Thought they could have been some promotional balloons for some event although they did not appear tethered.  They were spherical and a darkish color, one perhaps a hundred feet above the other and maybe a few hundred feet above the ground, seemingly stationary and silent, perhaps as large as a house, they seemed a couple of miles away. Definitely could not say what they were.  Definitely could say they were not a conventional aircraft or helicopter.

I was outside my college dormitory and we were having a school event.  I am Native American and we were having a drum and dance social event.  I was singing with the other singers when one of the drummers pointed to the northwest and said &ldquo;Oh my god! Look at that!&rdquo;  I turned and looked it was night time out when I turned and looked I thought we would be crushed in a few seconds by the enormous ship we saw.  It seemed to be landing.  It was so enormous I can only say that it looked like a large metropolis landing.   It made no sound but had a strange energy that you could &ldquo;sense or feel&rdquo;.  It had millions of little lights all over it and in many colors.  It was like a city because it was not a uniform shape.  It had many appendages and parts to it.  It was so big it seemed to nearly block out that part of the sky.  I was standing there and just complete shock hit me.  That is all I remember.  When we &ldquo;came to&rdquo; or became conscious again I felt dazed and like the memory of it was fading so quickly that I had to meditate quickly to hold it in my mind.  Everyone else seemed to just go back to what they were doing and when I tried to get them to talk about it or even come with me to go search for it, they seemed like zombies.  At the time I was pregnant, I don&rsquo;t know if that was a factor in how I might have been treated if we were abducted or if our minds were manipulated at all.  I was a peer counselor at the time at the schools student drop in center &ldquo;The Healing Circle&rdquo;.  I ran A.A. meetings and held traditional &ldquo;Talking Circles&rdquo; for the Native students who needed support emotionally and we had our own licensed Psychologist on staff as well.  He was standing right next to me and witnessed this too. I believe we lost some time too. He was the only one who wanted to go running after this thing.  I eventually convinced some friends who were not there to witness it to take me to look for it.  We rode around in the car for a bout two hours.  We couldn&rsquo;t find anything and it should have been right on top of us if! it was going to really land anyway.  While we were driving around we did see military jets circling the area for quite awhile.  I believe people called the radio stations and 911 too.  I can&rsquo;t confirm that though. The strangest thing was that I did forget the incident for about 5 years I could not remember it.  One day I was working with some youth, I am now a social worker, we were driving toward Minneapolis&rsquo;s downtown and we could see the skyline.  We were talking about strange things like Bigfoot and UFO&rsquo;s when suddenly the memory came flooding back instantly.  I was overwhelmed and that same shocked feeling came over me. I still don&rsquo;t remember what happened though between the times I saw it landing and then the next second &ldquo;poof!&rdquo; it was just gone, completely vanished. I have never reported this before.  I found this website and thought it was time to tell the story.

The night was beautiful and clear, the moon was hanging large and low on the horizon. These objects or object turned southeast and flew directly over my house and then suddenly vanished. I was standing at my open rear door of my house when the sound of an approaching helicopter caught my attention, As usual with any low flying aircraft, I would go outside to watch for it. As soon as I stepped out onto my rear deck my attention was diverted to two bright lights approaching from the north. At first I thought the lights were stars and stationary, but then I soon realized they were moving in my direction. They were moving slowly in tandem as if two planes were flying in formation, one in front of the other. This struck me as very odd so I continued to watch them. The two lights were approaching me from a slight angle and they never once deviated laterally from their position. They continued heading in my direction. I stood there trying to understand what it was that I was looking at. As it over flew my house, I ran through the house and called for my teenage son to come to the front door to observe this as well. The two of us stood watching this thing cruise overhead silently and almost effortlessly. We both stood motionless trying to understand what it was we were watching. Within a few seconds the two lights flashed off in unison and it was all over. The object appeared to be close; however, it had no discernable shape. The object made absolutely no sound. The space and distance between the two lights can be measured by extending one full arm length and turning your hand at a 90 degree angle. one hand length.

I am an instrument rated Private Pilot and I think I have a pretty good understanding of what airplanes look and sound like. This was no airplane, as this object had none of the required position lights / navigation lights or strobes that one would recognize as local aviation.

There was a bright white light, moving across the top of the tent, casting heavy shadows of the tree branches like a search light. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it, dismissing it as a plane or helicopter even though there was no noise. I got up to go to the bathroom *about 2, 2:30* I was walking back when I noticed a white light flying across the sky. Being an aviation nerd I noticed the object (a plane to me at the time) was flying very fast, but then I focused on it and there were no strobes, as by FAA regulated law, you must have strobes on any flying aircraft. You&rsquo;ve seen then on the tips of the wings and also a red one on the belly of the craft. I thought that it was strange but again dismissed it as a possible government plane with permission. When I got back to the camp site my brother was standing out of the tent looking at the sky, he said he saw a bright light, like I had, except he saw the one I encountered and then another one a couple min. after I left. We were just messing around looking at the sky, and saw another bright white light; however it was coming from the side, and was growing brighter, as if heading straight for us. As we looked on, the light suddenly shot off the right, and up. The light was the same color and brightness as the one I saw earlier. We watched it till it disappeared behind the trees, though it was still flying as we could just make it out behind the branches. We saw more lights (howeve!  not near as bright) flying the same direction. They appeared to change altitude slightly every few seconds, though I cannot be sure. All I know is that they were NOT planes, helicopters or any sort of FAA regulated craft, they were too fast, and did not have enough lights to be planes. Unless there were 5 planes without required lights, and one plane that could change directions extremely rapidly, then there is something weird going on. The sightings lasted between about 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM, the sun came up and we were unable to see more, or they had all left. I have though about this for a while and am unable to come to any conclusions as to what they may have been.*If investigators would like to contact me, please do so via e-mail as I currently have no phone.  I will update with new phone number if possible.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I thought a picture of this would be nice because they were so outstanding in the night sky.  I went into the house to get my camera (SONY DCS585). I did not have the camera set on night vision, so the pictures I took are really dark.  I downloaded them and brightened them.  To my amazement, all kinds of &quot;objects&quot; showed on the screen.  I DID NOT see any of these images while observing the night sky. The sequence of the picture numbers are 02133, 02134 and 02136.  02135 showed nothing out of the ordinary. The time I took the pictures is from 8:54-8:55pm CT (which is in the property of the picture information). The only changes that were made was to enhance the images and enlarge a red orb to see it better.  I have all the original pictures still in my camera. I am sending these to you through email so that you might take a look at them.  Again, I saw nothing and heard nothing. I am a college graduate with a BS degree in Sociology and English.

Thanks!", "I was driving up to Raleigh, NC on I-95 N from Fayetteville, NC to visit some friends. It was about 10:30 at night. I am pretty sure it was June 25 (Monday).  All of a sudden I saw this large ball of blue light emerge just above the tree line and zip across the highway. It had a smaller blue light at the very end of it  - I would say both lights were more at the tips of the craft rather than on the underside of it. I also noticed vertical grooves (evenly spaced) on it as it neared the other side of the highway before disappearing over the trees. I am assuming it is cigar-shaped but from the angle I saw it at - although, it could have been saucer shaped. It made absolutely no sound whatsoever. I drove a little ways down to get a better view where there weren&rsquo;t any trees. I could see all the way to the horizon. There was nothing there. It made no sense. I have traveled this road on many occasions and I am used to seeing planes fly overhead and I always like to look at them as they fly off into the distance. I couldn&rsquo;t even see any lights or anything at all out there. It was as if it never happened.  Overall, I&rsquo;d say I saw the craft for about 10 - 15 seconds, if that.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Twin glowing white lights silently traverse the sky in Spencer Iowa then fade outA little after 11pm Central Time I was out stargazing in the cornfields just outside of Spencer Iowa looking at the alignment of moon and stars when two lights passed just below the moon and silently traveled halfway across the sky maintaining their same relative position and distance between each other.  (perhaps one huge object with lights at corners)  The lights were white and glowed steady with no colors or blinking.  The distance between the lights was about the width of a full moon.  After several minutes they just faded away and were nowhere to be seen.  Odd and disorienting they were definitely not planes.((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??

While following the path of one plane I noticed a silver dot in the sky of which the plane had just flown under.  Having seen this perspective I was able to observe the silver dot hovering in a motionless position high above land then disappear in what appeared to be an ascet out of the blue sky and out of sight; straight upwards. This piqued my curriosity and I questioned if what I had seen was real.  30 minutes later an orange or copper colored dot appeared which seemed to be more observable than the silver object I observed earlier.  The orange dot was hovering when suddenly two white dots appeared into sight.  The three objects hovered motionless for some moments then swayed back and forth.  Hovering in a triangle formation. My initial thoughts were that I was seeing Mars(orange or copper color) and two neighboring stars.  I was skeptical only to the fact that I&apos;ve never observed stars in the daytime much less Mars.  It also seemed that the formation was shifting from a right triangle to an obtuse triangle which took away any assumptions of planets and stars appearing stationary during the daytime. I took pictures of the sky using my camera phone.  The quality of the camera I don&apos;t think is good enough to have captured these objects digitally.  However if someone would like to examine them I took 5 or so pictures of the sky.  I also walked over to a life guard and pointed out what I was observing.  He had no explanation of what these objects were but did see them as well once I pointed them out. Minutes later the objects flew off in what appeared to be heading south in the sky.  Their departures were very swift and disappeared in what seemed to last less than a second.  I approached the life guard again and had asked if he still saw the objects in the sky.  He answered no and stated he saw the one object fly off.  As we tried to make sense of what we had just witnessed, another small white object started to appear.  This turned out to be a seagull&apos;s down feather descending onto the beach.  Our eyes had not been fooled.  These were not jets, clouds, or feathers.  Instead they mimicked the hours and hours of footage found documenting UFO&apos;s.  Which tells me that anyone with a trained eye can spot them.  They&apos;ve been around for a long time and will continue to be.", "I enterd a sighting last night in Wichita Falls Texas and after talking to you on the telephone and going to Heavens Above, although the time is off a little, I now know that it was probably Iridium 42 that I saw in the sky.

He says hey look at that. I looked and it almost looked like to me a shadow like u.f.o but it was a balloon. 20 minutes later he goes whats that in the sky and it looked like a candle like light bulb going as fast as a balloon floating in the sky we saw ealier and was very,very high in the sky. I like what is that, I was looking trying to get what ever it was attention saying stop and trees were blocking the view when my camera phone was focusing. Tree ending up blocking my view. So could not take picture. All the sudden my friend said it&apos;s only a plane and I was looking I am like thats no plane I started scream stop,come over here, and then tree blocked the view and then I went in my front yard and I was like holy cow it was still moving I still had my cellphone and tried to take another picture and it was a open view no trees this time to block the view. Then it looked like it slightly bursted when it hit a light shaded cloud. My friend was like did you see that I never saw anything like that. Then I siad lets wait here it might be back. Then my friend said forget about it it&apos;s gone. I reported stuff I saw in the past. What I think what this stuff is are goverment experiments or Holograms. If it was really a U.F.O. I think it was following the balloon like it was studying it. I took a picture of the cloud it hit. Like as if maybe there a vortex to bring the light back to the dimmension it came from. I think it noticed that I was gonna try to take a picture of it so it burst once it hit cloud. I saw a shadowman with snake tongue in the past. I saw a 1950&apos;s type U.F.O. before. I saw liquid moving all around the sky. I am sick of seeing this stuff. Everyone I tell don&apos;t beleive what i saw. I saw other minor stuff also. When the goverment gonna stop with this. I know I am not crazy. I am just gonna blame it on the goverment. Lots of people report this stuff all the time.

I calculated the distance to be hundreds of meters judging by the size. But when I followed the object with my eyes it was moving to the left, in the sky.

He was the head of police office in Alor islands area when it happened.  He said there were six aliens who came to the area.  They have long arms, wavy silver-color-hair, and some of them have beard.  They wore blue clothes with high collar, belt with some gray cylindric stick and shoes that look like black military boot.  Some inhabitants said that they searched for something.  A report said that a six-year-old kid was kidnapped and be returned in confuse in some field area.  Finally, some policemen waited and soon met with them.  The police then shooted them (around 13 metres at distance) but they realized none of them were bleed, nor dead body found.  It was strange because the police shooted them in a very near distance.  The police only found some trees were fall down and some footprints which ended in around five metres and then disappear.

We had just returned from Hibbing, Minnesota where we were shopping.  We were about to relax and have a drink. I was leaning back in my chair looking up at the sky which was almost totally clear and blue, except for clouds near the horizon.  Basically , it wa a totally clear sky, bright with sunlight.  Windy.My girlfriend was checking on her flowers.  I saw 3 white spots in the sky slightly southwest of vertical (toward Duluth).  I thought they might be fighter airplanes which do pass over at times.  And I thought they could be white birds.  However these objects were very, very high or at least appeared to be and I could not see any definition in the shape as you might with a bird or plane.  My girlfriend thought they appeared triangular.At first sight these spots were in a straight line and proceeding to the Northwest  by West.  I thought I might have seen a tether, but I may have simply interpreted the regular in line motion as tethered.  I was thinking of baloons.  But the fact was I knew that the objects did not appear as baloons or aircraft or birds.  The three spots were not shiny.  They were dead white.  They proceeded in a straight line as though on the wind.  I think the wind was in the opposite direction.  Very soon after first sight the objects moved in relation to each other, first appearing in the shape of an &quot;L&quot; with two fairly close together, almost touching.  But as the movement went on the three objects took positions at the vertices of a perfect equalateral triangle.  The triangle did not rotate.  There was no sound.  The motion was very steady as you see in a flight of birds.  As the white spots moved more to the Northwest, they stopped.  Abruptly.  The motion seemed kind of chaotic at that point, but reorginized and then began moving more or less straight south. It was then that the spots disappeared.  On first sight, with the objects in line, the appearance was quite different, but I would say the distance between the two outer objects or spots and the center was about the same as the distance between the points of the triangel shape later assumed.   If the points were tied together, the changing shape might have been that of triangle being rotated so that I just saw it from a different angle.  In the middle of this incident I got a cell phone call from my daughter about band practice.  That distracted me as I tried to get her to go and look.I called the Duluth Air National Guard security service at 5:45, a half hour after the sighting because maybe they had it on radar.  Of course, I didn&apos;t get any information and really, I was happy just to report what I saw.I am certain that the thing I saw was white.  Dead white. Not shiny.  It didn&apos;t change direction quickly although it may have been going very fast.  It must have disappeared instantly.  I don&apos;t know how high it was.  Certainly higher than birds flying.

It moved in a northward direction, but was quite faint and I found it difficult to track the object&rsquo;s movement. I watched the object for between 30 seconds and 1 minute. The security light was on by our garage (impeding my ability to track the object), and as the object continued moving southward, I lost sight of it.  I walked over to the outdoor light and unplugged it to see if I could locate the object again, and after approx. 1 minute, I located the object a second time (however, it could have been a second object, as I did lose track of this object for approx. 1 minute.  The object was now tracking southward at was moving at approximately the same speed.  From my position, the object was traveling at a trajectory that was in-between the moon (to the southwest) and what I assumed to be Venus (to the southeast) &ndash; it being the brightest &ldquo;star&rdquo; in night sky.  After tracking the star-like object for approx. 30 seconds, out of the corner of my eye I spotted a shooting star &ndash; to my left (east).

Note: I did not track the object all the way to a southern horizon position &ndash; instead, it seemed to grow fainter until reaching a point where the object was no longer in sight.

At first glance it appeared to be a small airplane or maybe a news chopper.  But after a few seconds of observation, I noticed that the brown to rusty colored object was indeed a new sight to me!  We have had rain every day for about two weeks and it was very cloudy, so the object only appeared briefly (about ten seconds) and was gone behind the clouds.  The shape is hard to explain, but for lack of a better term, it resembled an upside down helicopter!  Only there was more to it.  A vertical shaft with the lower part of the shaft being slimmer and attached to a horizontal section.  Toward the top of it, there were two more horizontal sections.  One on each side appearing like wings.  Nothing was spinning or making noise or blinking-no lights. Which all contradicts most sightings I have read about in the last day!  It was a brief but exciting experience for me and the first of its&rsquo; kind for me.  I have found no way to identify it yet, but I will always remember the way it looked and the movement of this object!  The one other fact the interests me is that the sighting was directly above the Grand Parkway that is being built because it is a huge undertaking that will take years to finish and maybe it was some sort of observation?!

For about a week they spoke about the incident to friends, who said that they were serious about it.Some days later,  I drove by the area, an saw that the army had a flatpbed truck by the side of the road and had roped off the woods around the service road there.Afterwards, when I went walking there, I saw a crushed, burnt area about one hundred feet across in the shape of a circle in a field.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "3 craft sighted by several witnesses in clear daylight conditions.  Timepiece anomoly also occuredAt the annual UFO Conference put on by the UFO Watchtower in Hooper, CO several people had the opportunity to witness UFOs.  About 2:00 PM Stan Romanek (one of the featured speakers at the event) was near the parking area outside the presentation building and was excited as he told me about the UFO he had just witnessed and taken some pictures of.  He was really excited that he got pictures of it.  He pointed out a spot above a patch of clouds near where the object was about 4 fingers (at arms length) above the distant mountain horizon in the northwest sky.He mentioned what he saw to a couple other people earlier and walked across the field to the RV he was staying in about 1:30 PM.  He was going to put the image on his laptop computer and bring it back so we could all see what the picture looked like.  He returned and set the laptop up on a table outside under the shade of a canopy of an RV set up to serve food.  As he got the computer set up I continued to scan the skies, especially in the area he had seen the object.  We were excited to see that he did get a picture of it.  It was white in color and although it was a digital image at a distance you could make out the classic saucer shape with a bubble protrusion on top.  A few of us were taking turns looking at the image because the brightness of reflection of the sky in the monitor made it difficult to see well unless you stood directly in front of it.While about 5 or 6 people were marveling at the picture Stan had just taken (with a Nikon Coolpix 6 mega pixel digital camera) I saw what appeared to be the same object in the same location off in the distant N/W horizon.  I would guess the distance to be at least 35 miles away based on the distance of the mountain range it appeared to be over.  It was very white and was dramatically accentuated by the darker blue sky background.  It was also about 4 fingers (arms length) above the distant mountaintop to the northwest about the width of my pinkie finger above the white cloud bank below.I described the location as I pointed to the object for the others to identify also.  They were as excited as I was to realize for themselves how fascinating it was to watch.  You could easily see that the object was not a cloud, balloon or plane.  It stood perfectly still and the distinct sharpness of the edges eliminated it being a cloud as you could compare it to other clouds in the area.We all watched as the stationery object defied cloud movement and all other rational or logical cross references we could use.  Someone noticed an identical object about a pinkie width directly above the one we were watching.  The one above slowly moved downward toward the original object until it was directly over the other nearly touching it.After watching the object for a minute or two to eliminate any plausible explanation for what I was witnessing I went to get my camera and took 3 pictures.  The 5 mega pixel Kodak photos were not distinct as the ones Stan took and only showed a white spot with no definition.  At that time I left to tell others in the nearby building attending the conference about what was happening outside.  By the time I returned both objects had left in different directions according to those watching it.I served in the military in the mid- late 1960s in Naval Air Intelligence and was trained in aircraft identification.  I am confident this was a physical object and not any kind of natural phenomenon.  I have attached the 2 photos I took even though they are very poor quality compared to what we were visibly seeing.Another odd note is that 6 individuals&rsquo; cell phones or watches were 1 hour off that morning plus another was 2 hours and another was off by 3 hours.  The cell phone services were provided by at least 3 different services.  No one had any explanation for this oddity.This is the first time I&rsquo;ve reported a sighting.", "Craft was flat black, noiseless and massive and boomerang in shape all smoothe in detail outline.The UFO sighted was triangular in shape, flat black with no lights.It was hovering due south, about 100 ft or a little more over homes across the street where I was stopped in my vehicle.There was NO NOISE.

My husband and I did not see what they were talking about but as we were about to go back inside, we did see something. It looked just like a star in the sky, so it was in outer space. It was moving upwards in a vertical direction in the sky. It was moving so fast! Within seconds it had moved from right above the horizon line to the other side of the sky. I don&apos;t think it was a satellite because I don&apos;t think they travel that fast. It definitely wasn&apos;t a plane or a jet because it was like a star, so I know that it was in space.

The light would blink brightly on and off from the same location. Then I would see nothing until it faded back into sight with the intensity of a bright star (as bright as Venus) but very focused in intensity as if a giant spotlight was pointed downwards. It glowed for about 4 seconds with an intensity similar to a bright white halogen light but very powerfull since it appeared the object was very high. I got the impression it was very high up but I was unable to tell for sure how high. My first impression of the altitude was about 40,000 or more. 10 minutes later in the same direction a spotted a fast moving ball of light that shot across the sky from the east to the west. It was visible for only a  a second. It went the speed of a slower meteorite but showed none of the common characteristics such as  breaking up in the atmosphere and changing colors and flickering until it fades. This object had a white glow with a hint of green and blue but it happened so fast I can&apos;t totally be sure of the precise color. I am very sure this was not a shooting star because it&apos;s size would have created a fireball of some form it was very even in Luminescence and seemed to be unaffected by the atmosphere or was up too high for any air friction.", "We thought we were looking at a kite until it started to move strangely.Object was seen in the eastern sky east of Wadsworth, in Arvada, CO.

My husband said that no, that is not a kite.  The object pointed itself southward and then due west across Wadsworth Blvd and headed west towards the mountains. We were in the car and were unable to track it from that point.  We got a decent look at it.  It was boomerang shaped, metallic and glistening.

It suddenly appeared, lasted about 6 seconds and dissappeared after that.  It looked similar to white trails made by commercial air planes, but was black in colour and very sharp, not blurred like the white trails (looked like a beam or laser almost).  The odd thing is how it just suddenly appeared and dissappeared again within 6 seconds. It started from the east end of the sky and ended towards the west. The line didn&apos;t start to appear and become longer, it appeared entirely all at once.

I am interested in airplanes, and we live about 40 minutes away from Sky Harbor International Airport.

But I could tell it didn&apos;t look like a weather balloon or an aircraft. By then, it actually was moving but at a very very slow pace. It now seemed about 3-4 inches away from the sun. I then got our telescope out and tried to focus on it. When I got it, the image was really blurry but now up close it had a goldish shade to it.

I had my own small plane in Alaska so am somewhat knowledgeable of aircraft.I was sitting on my back porch about 10 PM on Saturday, July 28, 2007 when I saw what appeared to be a low flying aircraft without any noise traveling south at a high speed. It was traveling at least 3 to 4 times faster than a small airplane would at about 1,000 feet, so I would guess between 300 and 400 MPH if at that altitude. If it were higher it obviously would have been a greater speed. If I had been driving a car I would have thought it to be a low flying Lear Jet sized aircraft without running lights, but I was on my back porch in the quiet country. I have no close neighbors or noise polluting source.The noisless aircraft had 3 round lights in a row that appeared to be windows lit up brightly. There were no red or green running lights, nothing but the window lights. The full moon slightly shadowed what appeared to be an oblong fuselage but no wings could be seen (but could have existed).It traveled south in a level straight line at about a 40 degree angle above the horizon. It passed behind a large backyard Chestnut tree and I waited to see it emerge on the other side. It didn&apos;t, so must have turned south or north over my house, where I would not have been able to see it.It is unlikely that the aircraft was small because of the 3 windows and speed. I&apos;d estimate it about the size of a Lear Jet at 1,000 feet. It is unlikely the aircraft was coasting without power because there are no landing areas nearby for one that large and I would have heard it power up. There is a small grass private airstrip about 1.5 miles south but it couldn&apos;t have landed there. The nearest airport large enough is about 10 miles north and the aircraft could not have made it a fraction of that distance without power.I do not believe in UFOs from another world. However, I do believe it was an aircraft, possibly a small noiseless jet, that could be a secrete. If this is the case, I can&apos;t believe it would be flying over Patrick County, Virginia on a full moon night where it could be observed.

BROWN   SCHOHARIE   PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR BY L. CUTHBERT     1823   The meteor  About the year 1790, on a clear summer evening, I was sitting on the stoop playing the fiddle.  About 9 o&rsquo;clock in the evening a shine of light appeared and increased until it overshone even the light of the meridian sun in some clear day, and enlightened my stoop in such a manner, that I might have picked up a pin in every corner.  Then I heard a great roaring coming direct from the North,  I started up and looked out from the stoop, and behold! I saw a fiery meteor, or as the Germans call it a &quot;mine droke,&quot;  a dragon coming on and passing by at the distance of about 250 yards West of me, a distance of about 60 or 70 feet above the cleared ground.  It kept along down through the hollow, on the other side of the hollow it met with the rising of the hill covered with woods and tall trees, there it took a sudden rise and went just over the tall trees so as not to touch them, and on over a kind of flat or level ground, until it met with the foot of the noted hill, by the Indians called &quot;Owelus Sowless,&quot; then it ascended higher, ascending as the ground rose, and went over the hill where I could not watch it farther.   I had had a view of it about a mile and a quarter.  It moved about as fast as a common horse in a horse race.  The meteor as I shall now call it, was about 300 yards long in a serpentine shape, excepting the head which resembled the root of a tree plucked up by force.  It had no appearance of a neck, the body was thick as a bullock, tapering off like a serpent at the end of the tail.  The appearance was similar to welding hot iron and sparkling like it.  The immense heat warmed through my whole house, and left a stench like burning tar and sulphur, which was smelled all the next day.

I do believe in UFOs and I love weather related things so I am always looking at the sky when I am outside. I noticed a very very bright light. The sun had not totally gone down yet , and there were no other stars in the sky. I grabbed my binoculars to see if I could see it closer, but it was hard. All it did was made it look even shinier and the form would change because of the lenses I am assuming. I grabbed my video recorder instead and tried to get as close to the object as I could. Through that, this bright light looked like it had a type of &apos;strobe&apos; effect. It had remained in the same spot for 15 minutes (as far as I know, because I dont know how long it was there before I went outside) but as i was viewing it thru my camera, it moved and I was no longer able to see it as trees were obstructing my view. It did this quite slowly , not a quick motion. I went to all of my windows of my 2 story house to see if I could capture its view again, but to my dismay, it was gone. It was the brightest thing I&apos;ve ever seen in the sky ever. I dont know &apos;N,S,E,W&apos; it was but I do know that it was in the area of a power plant.

All we could see was blinking lights off in the distance from plains like you do any other night. I don&apos;t know what i saw, I really wish I knew. I live next to a military base, so maybe they have something to do with it... I don&apos;t know.

On the night of 8/1/07 I witnessed the same type of orange lights again. This time the lights showed up at 10:15pm, but it was only 2 lights this time and they were farther apart and a little higher off the horizon. They were in around the same area of the sky as the night before. Again the first light appeared dim, then brightened and disappeared. Right after the first light went out the second one appeared above and to the left of the first one.It started dim, brightened then disappeared. The sighting only lasted seconds but was bright and very noticeable in the night sky.  This time there was no military aircraft involved. In the previous report from the night of 7/31/07. I stated that it was hard to tell if I was seeing 1 craft with multiple lights or 3 separate craft in tight formation. Well now after the sighting on the second day and only seeing 2 lights that were father apart, I am inclined to say that it was 3 separate craft on the first night. I will be keeping an eye out again this evening and plan on having the video recorder with me.

Ok, I was laying on the golf course with 2 friends and one of them turned to me and said what is that? I looked up and there were 2 flashing white lights moving parallel to eachother. One light would flash for a half of a second as thenother turned off for a half of a second. I know for a fact that it was not an airplane because there was no noise and I could not see the object between the lights (if there was one). They were moving about 2 times the speed of an average airplane would move in the sky. They seemed about the same altitude that an airplane would travel. I am still in shock of what happened and i cannot get it out of my mind.

We were watching the evening sky grow dark. The sun set around 9ish. When I first started viewing the night sky a sliver of a moon and a bright star to the right were visible if you are facing the pacific ocean.As the darkness increased I became aware of two brighter objects appearing between the moon and the bright star.  At first I thought they were stars that were further away and needed more darkness to be seen.  That was until they started to move.  They took off from over the ocean headed southeast at a fairly decent pace.  By this point I have caught my boyfriends attention because I practically had my face planted in the windshield. It was at this point I asked the question to no one in particular and to myself out loud &quot;What in the hell is that?&quot;  My boyfriend noticed what I was seeing and we both started exiting the car. Him to get the camcorder out of the trunk I already had my camera in hand and was ready to take pictures. I started shooting as soon as I could but didn&apos;t think I was getting anything so I kept looking over the camera to make sure I was pointing it in the right direction. Meanwhile my boyfriend was getting the camcorder trying to capture what we were seeing. While I was trying to capture the still shots I witnessed a triangular shaped silver object appear 40 to 50 feet above my head going to the right or northwardly up the beach no sound accompanied any of these objects. When I gave up in my attempts to get pictures and turned back to my boyfriend to see if he was getting it on film I witnessed them disappear into the southeastern sky. May be a minute later we witnessed two light seemingly further away and dimmer flying a bit further apart flying from the SW to the NE. We are not sure if they were the same two or two new ones. We watched the sky for about another half an hour and witnessed nothing else at that location. We finally headed back to our motel room about a quarter mile from the origi! nal sigh ting. we discussed what each had seen my boyfriend confirmed the two bright lights I had seen but he says he saw a third light I didn&apos;t see forming a triangle shape with the first two but he reports that he didn&apos;t witness the triangular silver object that I seen headed north. we spent the rest of that evening watching the skies off the oregon coast and an orange glow of what looked to be something burning on the horizon where the sky meets the ocean.

I watched the red blinking light till we get to the light to turn onto Rt 90 going east. When we reached the stop light, the red blinking light then turned into two three lights,. It looked like three small lights, red, wight and blue, but my husband said it wasn&rsquo;t blue that he thought it was green.

It was now moving very fast and almost caught up with the car and I thought it was going to fly right over us, then the light flared and became very bright for a second, I watched it the whole way home.

They were both moving in the same direction, approximately southeast. There was no sound associated with the objects. I looked closely and saw no other colored lights, such as red or green that I have seen with high flying aircraft, with the two lighted objects. The visibility of the two lighted objects faded and was lost while the objects were still high in the sky. I of course am very curious concerning what I was looking at. I am no nonsense person.

I live in an area that has minimal light poloution and I could see all the stars, and I thought this was Venus but Venus is not this low in the night sky that I have ever seen. I looked at this very bright light to try and discern whether it was moving because I wan&apos;t conviced it was the planet Venus, and after 10 0r 15 mins of stationary position the bright light snapped off and immediately began ascending in a steady but wobbly manner with blinking red lights, and once it reached the altitude it wanted it proceeded to move north. It&apos;s lift was not that of a plane nor when it began moving north after leveling off, it moved faster than a plane would or could, and the thing that convinced me that this was unusual was that my dog was very skittish as were the other dogs in the neighborhood with their barking, but my dog didn&apos;t bark he just stayed close next to me which is not our normal behavior when I go out to the hot tub, we play ball when I am in the tub.

I was coming up on Lake Seminole and I noticed a straight line shape, metalic/dull white in color with no reflection that I could notice out on my left flying at my exact altitude right on the horizon. I noticed it when I was scanning the skies for other aircraft, like a good pilot should do. But something struck me as odd about this thing, beause it appeared to be flying. At first glance I thought maybe it was just a metal barn or something, but as I went along it stayed in the exact location on my left on the horizon, about 700-1000 feet away is my best guess.  At that point I knew it was something that was airborne. And then I thought it might be a glider, because of its extremly smooth flight, but then I saw no fusalage, like a normal aircraft would have. And thats when I knew there was something very strange about it. It maintained its realitive postion on my left on or very near the horizon. There were no speed changes, I tried to gain on it by putting in full throttle to get up beside it but it just stayed the same distance the whole time.  I tried to gain some altitude to get a more 3-D image of it but it climbed when I climbed. I did a dutch roll (tipped the wings back and forth while keeping the nose in the same postion, not changing course) facing it, just to let it know I was aware of it, and it did not respond, just staying horizontal and keeping the same distance (I was going around 90-95). Like I said, I could not really get on &apos;top&apos; of it to see a great 3-D image of it but I got a pretty good look at it and I would say it had to be a disc. I kept questioning myself the entire time thinking &quot;is this really what I think it is?&quot; and then when I got over lake seminole I could see it above the lake and I knew it was in the air and REAL, no me seeing things. There were several boats and p eople out on the lake so I KNOW someone else had to see it, as we were over the middle of the lake, and it was a Saturday in the middle of summer at aound 1:20 in the afternoon, so there was lots of activity below. I did glance down at my altitide meter and it read 2000 feet, and this was in the middle of the encounter. I could have lots or gained a hundered feet or so from the begining or end of the sighting but 2000 is the average alititude I&apos;d say. I would glance away from the object from time to time to scan the horizon for other aircraft but I never say any.  And when I was over lake seminole I radiod in at Quincy airport that I was over lake seminole and that there was a unidentified flying craft flying with me over the lake, hoping someone might come out to see for themselves. I kept my eyes on it till we got over the lake and then I glanced away from it back towards Quincy for only a brief half second and then glanced back toward where the object usually was and it was gone. No sign of it. I was kinda ticked at myself for not keeping my eye on it and letting it &apos;get away&apos;. But it had stayed with me so long that I was feeling complacent and kinda felt comfortable that it was going to stay there. And I also noted that 30 seconds o a minute after I lost it it started to rain lightly, as I notcied drops on my canopy. The best physical visual I can give you is if you a quarter away to you on your left at eye level. Thats what it looked like. Please feel free to contact me as I would like to know if anyone else has come forward from the lake below or whatnot.", "I was watching the McGlaphlin Group on PBS last Sunday.

As the Osprey gained the upper hand and chased the crows to the west, behind a stand of redwood trees, I saw a flash as if one of the Osprey had become brilliantly illuminated by the sun.  As I watched I realized that what I was seeing was not a bird, it appeared on that perfectly clear day in a brilliant blue sky to be nothing more than a strangely ovoid shaped cloud-lit a pale white.  I watched for a moment as the &quot;cloud&quot; moved across the sky in an unerring straight line.The &quot;cloud&quot; appeared to the west at between 30 and 45 degrees elevation and proceeded along a northern path gradually diminishing in size until I could track it no longer.  My friend came outside just as the object had decreased to the size of a pencil tip and could not see it even as I pointed out it&apos;s location.  When it first appeared it was perfectly visible and had a relative size of three inches in length from my point of view.  I cannot estimate the distance exactly due to uneven terrain and obstructed views but my best guess is that the altitude of the object was less than 20,000 feet and moving at a moderate rate of speed.  The entire sighting took only a few minutes before the object vanished from view in the distance.There was no sound or other effects associated with the object, no contrails or other emmissions were visible and no deviation was made from a straight path.", "White dot over Spokane WA moving in extreme angles instantlyAbout 10:30-11:00 P.M. in the northwest sky from Spokane WA.

It almost looked stationary but after watching it for a minute or so I realized it was coming closer as it appeared to be raising higher on the horizon. This apparent movement is what really held my interest. As I wathched this light coming closer it suddenly and very rapidly moved to the right (northwest?). This movement covered a significant portion of the horizon but from my vantage point I was still basically facing west. After this apparent 90 degree turn and movement the light just sat stationary on the horizon. From this point the object did another 90 appearing to move straight down. This put it behind the tree tops on my horizon. It then seemed to bob around for a minute or so before making another sharp fast movement directly up. This once again put the light above the tree tops. Again this thing bobbed around for a few moments before its last big move. This final movement started from a close to stationary point above the treetops on the horizon , it steadily moved to the right again ,this time at about a 40 degree angle downward until it disappeared behind the trees then the horizon. The light did bob up behing those trees a few more times but never made another clear appearance. I checked my watch during this last sequence behind the trees,it read 2244hrs. I estimate this entire viewing lasted 4 or 5 minutes. I was not drinking , I do not do drugs , and I am on no major prescription drugs. The light was white in color and brighter than anything else in the western sky. From my location no sound could be heard coming from this light.

The first night we seen objects in the sky was over at a neighbor&apos;s house. The objects looked at first like twinkling star&apos;s, however they had bright red and white lights on them. My neighbor being airforce, and my husband being ex military brought up a good point, no aircraft on earth could be that high up in the sky and move that fast. The night was very clear on 07-06-07, truly amazing to see these objects. Anouther thing that we were thinking, no aircraft here can change direction at a 90degree angle going that fast. Tonight we brought out several other people, one adult and three older children to see if they see the same things. The adult thought we were out of our minds, but is now a believer once he seen them for himself. Now to let you know, there is a very small airport around here, however we hear and see them land and take off. We know what the lights look like from those, and can say that the objects we seen were nothing like an airplane. Tonight when an airplane did fly over, it took about 8-10 minutes to leave our sight, where as these objects are going at a much higher speed and are constantly changing direction. Right before we came inside for the night it became cloudy. We could no longer see any of these object&apos;s, however once again when a plane flew over, we could see the light&apos;s through the clouds.

It sounded like they had come from the direction of Jackson, MI (northwest of my location) and flew onward, in the direction of Brooklyn, to the southeast.   I didn&apos;t actually see them, only heard, what seemed to be, several loud, powerful helicopter engines (the whoop-whoop sound was easily noticibale)  At 8:00 EST I heard more heliocpters behind my home and they seemed to sit over the swamp behind my home.   There are several horse pastures surrounding this swamp and this realization made me concerned that there was possible animal mutilations occurring in my neighborhood.   I felt this because while hearing the helicopters come and go, I began to feel like I was being watched.  I&apos;ve had that same feeling while in the presence of the UFO phenomenon.  The helicopters left after a few minutes but I don&apos;t recall in which direction.Around 8:05 I hear them again.This time I ran for the camera as I wanted to get a photo or two.

They departed before I could get my Sony Cybershot DSC-H5 out and 2x telephoto lens attached.I was a bit unnerved by the helicopters and began to feel the overpowering need to take photographs outdoors.   Around 8:30 I went outdoors with camera and tripod in hand.   I set up to shoot some stills of the moon and try out the manual settings on this digital SLR.   I snapped a few images of the moon while having problems with the tripod.   I detached the camera body from the tripod and began snapping off dozens of photos into the air,just above the tree line to the NE.

It was flying from west to the east.The photo with the cigar shaped image was one of many images taken during a &apos;manual burst&apos; of dozens of images.   The image preceding the one with the cigar and the one after contain no objects in the sky but were taken within an extremely short time (1 to 5 seconds between images.It should be noted that both images employed 8x zoom (the camera has a 12x internal zoom) and a 2x telephoto lens.

I at first thought maybe it was a balloon or other debris but that couldn&apos;t be the case because this storm was moving basically to the West directly at me, and very slowly ! So any objects would have been heading straight towards me.This disk shaped object moving North to South was traveling very slowly, almost as if it were sightseeing. Lightning was very intense just east of my location so that ruled out any helicopters or private planes in the same area.

Close proximity.July 21, 2007 Approx. 21:00 Central Time Northwest of Madison WI Traveling Southeast on RT 12 and while turning East onto RT 19.Partly cloudy skies, dusk light, slight breeze. My wife, son and I were driving home from a walk in the woods.  It was dusk.   I was driving, my wife was in the front passenger seat and our 3 &frac12; year old son was in the back child seat (not a very reliable witness, I&apos;m afraid.)   While heading southeast on rt 12 shortly after crossing the Wisconsin River we were driving up the hill leading out of the river valley.  My attention was on the street in front of me when I &ldquo;felt&rdquo; something trigger in my peripheral vision vertically above my line of sight.  My gaze moved strait up and I found myself seeing a saucer shaped object with a high dome centered on top.  The object appeared to be relatively close and at a low altitude.  Between the visible horizon  and our location.  If I were to guess a diameter based on the perceived distance of the object I would say it was similar to that of a medium size commercial airplane, but that&apos;s really a shot in the dark.  The object radiated it&apos;s own light, which appeared similar to the Sun.  A high energy orange-ish yellow, but did not appear to be flickering or com busting, appeared very stable. As soon as my direct vision registered this object it promptly disappeared.  Just sort of blinked out of existence. I barely acknowledged it.  Although it did seem extraordinary, it was so quick and I was the only observer so it seemed almost useless to talk about and I promptly stuffed it to the back of my head.In addition to the above reasons for not dwelling on it is that I have been doing some fairly in depth research into the ufo disclosure culture recently and it could easily be interpreted that it was what I *wanted* to see. It would have been left at that, except about 3 &ndash; 4 minutes later I was making a left hand turn onto WI HW 19 east and out of the left edge of my peripheral vision I saw the same color in the sky.  But before  I even had the time to turn my head and look at it my wife GASPED.  &ldquo;Did you see it too!!?&rdquo; *Now* I was excited.  Before explaining at all what &ldquo;it&rdquo; was or indicating my observation, she described the same object, color, including it blinking out of visual perception as soon as her attention was drawn to it. She actually got a better view of it than I did.  It&apos;s possible this was a second object separate from the one I witnessed, but I doubt it.  It seemed like it had been stationary relative to our change in location.  When we got home she drew what she saw and her drawing matched up perfectly with the shape I saw. The most curious part of all of this is that it&apos;s only been for the last few weeks that she and I (to a greater extent, me) have been researching available data on the web pertaining to ufos/technology, attempting to find only the most credible sources and hard data.  It&apos;s amazing how much is out there, buried in disinformation, noise and junk claims, but the credible stuff is mind blowing and almost incomprehensibly important.  Regardless of what we saw tonight, it does feel like we are on the verge of something trans-formative as a species.   We better be, or else we&apos;ll just been a sedimentary layer of interesting archaeological artifacts soon enough. I&apos;m interested in speaking with other rational people about these topics.  I will see if the site admin here is willing to connect other with me without publicly disclosing my information.

My friend was smoking a cigarette while I was sitting enjoying the summer evening. Suddenly my eye caught what I thought was just a satellite. I soon realized that there was three of them traveling in an off set triangle. I immediately thought of the NOSS satellites, however one of them suddenly shot off! About the time I thought it couldn&rsquo;t get any stranger, the other two stopped and just sat there!  While we were watching them just sit there, we noticed an opposite direction satellite go zooming by, not sure if it was related or not. The other strange thing is that a few moments later we noticed a military jet appear to be travelling towards their direction. Since they were so dimly lit, and we never did see them start moving again, we eventually lost sight of them. I have been a professional firefighter for almost 16 years, I think I have a pretty good idea about what is normal in the night sky as I have also worked in the aerospace industry (as a firefighter) so I know aircraft.

In 1984, when I was 15, I was driving home with my Mom from the store. It was dusk, so there was still some light left. We were heading down Caton Farm Road, which, at the time, was just a two lane &quot;countryish&quot; road. When we were roughly a half mile from our street, we noticed a very bright white light up ahead just over the trees. It was completely out of place and we wondered out loud what it was. As we got closer and were able to see what was responsible for the light, and I think we about crapped our pants. There was a huge grey, metal disk just hovering above the trees over our neighbors house at the corner of our street. It was completely still. I wish I could say how big it was, but I honestly couldn&apos;t say. My Mom pulled over on the side of Caton Farm, a couple hundred yards away from it, at which point I flew out of the car and ran towards it. My Mom, of course, got out of the car and started screaming bloody murder for me to come back. I stood on the corner of my street and Caton Farm and just stared at the thing. It was above the trees (maybe a hundred feet) and shining a white light down that lit up my neighbors back yard. I can&apos;t remember how long it sat there in the sky, but it wasn&apos;t more than a minute or so. When it left, it was really surreal, because it looked like it wasn&apos;t moving that fast, but it disappeared from my sight so quickly. It just went up and then followed Caton Farm until it was gone. I had never been so excited as when I saw that thing. The first thing I did when I got home was to call both the police station and the local airport to see if anyone else had reported it. No one had, unfortunately. My Mom wouldn&apos;t talk about it with me and would get mad if I tried to bring it up. I think it really scared her. The next day, I couldn&apos;t wait to tell everyone in my Earth Science class. I picked that class because the teacher was really cool, and we always had great discussions about weird stuff. Needless to say, I was just about laughed out of the classroom. I told a few other people over the next couple of years, but after hearing &quot;are you sure it wasn&apos;t a helicopter&quot; one too many times, I never talk about it anymore. Until I found this site, I thought I was one in a million to see such a thing. I&apos;m glad to know I&apos;m not. I just wish the government would come clean with what they know. I hate the fact that I saw this amazing thing and have no idea what it means. At any rate, I&apos;m so glad I got to see it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I had just ended the conversation and was getting ready to go inside when I looked up into the East/Southeast sky and noticed two stars.  In between the stars was what I thought was another brilliant star.  It was extremely bright, that is what caught my eye. I watched it for less than a minute and was getting ready to look down and come inside when &quot;it&quot; moved.  It was not a satellite, we see satellites out here all the time and this object was much larger and not has high as a satellite. The bright object began moving a little north so I thought it was a jetliner coming in to land with its landing lights on.  (we are live along a jet highway in the sky and see many airplanes on a daily basis).  But then I realized if it was a jet it was too high to be coming in and the lights were nothing like I had very seen.The object then slowly started moving to the east/southeast.  I became very curious because I knew jetliners did not have &quot;landing lights&quot; on the back on the planes.  There were no flashing strobes to correctly identify it has an airplane either.  I also know airplanes don&rsquo;t fly backwards.  I heard no rumble of engines as we normally do when an airplane is passing by.  Even when the plane is at it&rsquo;s altitude of 30,000 to 40,000 feet we still here it fly over.I opened my back door and yelled for my husband to come look and tell me what it might be.  He was perplexed as I was.  He knows a lot about airplanes, civilian and military.  My two boys saw it as well.  We watched for about 30 seconds as the bright orb moved away from us and then all of a sudden it picked up speed and within a matter of five seconds or so it was out of our site.

The things that interested me most was 1) It was NOT flashing.2) There was NO sound.3) There was no trails of any kind and NO smoke.4) It was an incredibly bright white light. It never dimmed. In fact it stayed the same brightness as it passed over me and only faded as it got far away. I could see it for a good 20 miles after it passed over me.

His house was dark and my wife decided to go herself to see if he was home while I waited in our minivan with our two young kids who are still in car seats.  My oldest was sleeping and we didn&rsquo;t want to wake her up.  I had shut off the headlights and was trying to figure out how to dim the radio lights when out of my peripheral vision, I saw what I thought was an airplane streak from my front left to front right, almost above my vehicle.  This craft was flying very quickly at cloud level and could be seen in between two puffs of clouds on a partly cloudy night.  I had only briefly locked into the object when it entered into another big cloud and that was all I saw. This happened very quickly, a second or two.At first it didn&rsquo;t register as anything unusual since my immediate focus was elsewhere.  Since my wife was talking with her brother, I was able to think about what I had seen. I&rsquo;d spent my first three years in the Army at Fort Bragg, next to Pope AFB, where a lot of F-16s,  A-10s, and cargo planes such as the C-5 and then the new C-17 flew.  I had spent some time at Seymour Johnson AFB guarding cargo next to its runway and had intimate understanding how loud F-15s were.  When I was a kid growing up in Southern Wisconsin, C-130s flew over our house nap of the earth and so I knew how loud they were, what sound they made, and how much slower they were than fighter jets.  I spent a lot of time in C-130s and C-141s at Bragg as well.What I realized was that at that low of an altitude and at that speed, the only thing it could have been was a fighter jet hauling butt.  However, I know that fighter jets are not allowed to fly so low at those speeds over populated areas.  It was much too fast to be a C-130 or similar type of aircraft.  But the most distinctive fact that struck me, was that when this object flew over, it made no sound. Even in a minivan with engine running, the sound of a fighter jet going that fast that low would have been deafening.  I would have just heard it approach before seeing it, and heard it even longer after it passed over.  Instead, nothing at all.  No sound.I then realized that I might have seen a UFO.  I couldn&rsquo;t have been sure in the moment, but after analyzing all the facts, it couldn&rsquo;t have been any known aircraft.  It wasn&rsquo;t a satellite because they don&rsquo;t fly under the clouds.  I thought it might have been a meteor, but this flew at a straight horizontal path.  I&rsquo;m no meteor expert, but the ones I&rsquo;d seen always came at some angle to the horizon, are usually higher up in the sky, and appear whitish, not the orange light I&rsquo;d seen.  If it were that close, wouldn&rsquo;t I have heard something?  FYI, I spent 13 total years in the Army, about half on active and half in the Guard.  I started as ranger qualified paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne (11B) and finished as a Signal Corps officer within V Corps with one tour in Iraq.  I was with the 32nd Infantry BDE WIARNG between those two Active Duty stints.  I am currently a small business owner in a small MN town and only talk about my UFO sightings with people I trust or if someone else admits they saw one, too.I saw my first UFO sighting as a young teen and posted that experience in the WI area.

A glowing, reddish orange orb was floating through the trees in my backyard.  It was about 30 feet from where I stood and just about at my eye level. The orb looked about the size of a giant beach ball. Our yard fell away steeply just feet from the foundation.  I watched this for several seconds as my brain tried to compute what I was seeing.  I watched as it maneuvered through the dense trees, yet never came into contact with one.  It then emerged from the other side of the woods and slowly climbed in altitude until it cleared the hill on the other side of the woods. It then disappeared in the distance.  I listened to the local news reports and scanned the paper for days to see if anyone else had seen it.  This happened in a heavily populated suburb.  One week later, about 10 o&apos;clock PM, I was driving to Blockbuster with my husband and we spotted the same orb near the edge of town.  We followed it until it disappeared into the woods.This happened in the summer of 1992 in Cincinnati, Oh. It has haunted me ever since then.I was 45 at the time and a homemaker.

At first I thought it might be some balloons in the sky, but they did not bob and weave like balloons I&apos;ve watched float away. It sat still for about 3-4 minutes, then began moving very slowly to the south. It had no lights, and as it very slowly moved it seemed to also be moving up and away so that it became smaller and smaller. I was franticly trying to get my digital camera to work, but the batteries were dead, and every time I looked down at it, I could barely find the object again against the darkening sky.

The speed at which it was traveling and no apparent sound coming from it soon changed our mind.  A hot air balloon was mentioned, but again the speed was too great for a hot air ballon.  It traveled from the SE sky to the NW sky within our field of sight in a matter of seconds.  It did not appear to travel in a straight line, nor was it heading in a usual path that planes travel.

One was sun and the other was what I at first thought was the moon. when I looked up the second time the sun was behind the clouds the other was gone.   The object that I thought was a daytime full moon was not, there was no full moon in the sky at all. It had what seemed like the moons craters but instead of being irregular, it was very semetrical, it was circular with several smaller circles within the outer edges.

It changed colors, so I thought it was an ambulance or police car. I&apos;m guessing that the trailer park was about a mile away. The street light at night is pretty much all you can see of it otherwise. I was concerned because I knew some of the people there, one in particular I commuted to work with each day. But the light lifted off the ground, and so I thought it was a helicopter. But it then moved erratically, and I mean something crazy. I&apos;ve seen helicopters lift off several times, but this was wild. And the range of colors wasn&apos;t typical from what I&apos;ve seen. (At this point, I woke up my parents and we all watched it approach.)  It moved slowly, eventually coming our way, passing close to our house. That&apos;s when we got a good look at it. It was no helicopter. By this time, it&apos;s movement was straight and smooth. It seemed like it was flying much lower than the majority of planes I&apos;d see in the sky. Just before it got to our house, it&apos;s lights changed to a constant, steady white. No blinking or any other colors. I could see the outline exactly. It didn&apos;t look at all like a stealth bomber. It was a perfect triangle with three lights on the underside, one near each angle. No sound, and it was moving really slow. I&apos;ve seen helicopters move faster. If it was as high as the regular planes in the sky I would see (about those speeds), then it had to be pretty big.

On 15 June 2007 at approximately 2230, I and two other soldiers saw a strange object/formation/thing in the sky.  It looked like a funnel cloud about 100 feet tall and was approaching us from a northwest direction.  It was white/grey in color.  There were no visible lights on it. It was moving fairly fast.  I used my night vision goggles to get a better look at it.  I could then see two steady lights.  One light was at the bottom of the funnel and the other about halfway up the right side. As the object passed overhead, it looked more like a cone.  Once it passed us, it headed into a southeast direction, then immediately south.  I noticed a third light moving towards the object at a greater rate of speed with my night vision goggles in the same direction; both moving south from Baghdad.  The object and lights then began to fade out of sight. I am not sure if this was a UFO or the International Space Station, since they began working on it I believe the same day. I&apos;m sure there were other people who saw it here also. It was dark and wish I could have taken pictures.((NUFORC Note:  According to the schedule for the ISS, posted at www.Heavens-above.com, it was not visible from Iraq from June 9th to June 17th.

Colors were red, blue, green, yellow and orange.  While it appeared to be stationary over the two hour period it actually gradually dropped from about 30 degrees to about 10 degrees above the horizon.  I thought it might be a satellite but after checking the orbit speeds and trajectories of the Hubbell satellite and the International space station, it was easy to rule them out.  I also checked &quot;stationary&quot; weather satellites speeds and orbit and ruled them out.

It was so unusual, though, because it hovered in one place (we wondered if it was over the Golden Dome of Notre Dame, as it looked like it was above the campus). There is no way it could have been a star because of the way it moved and because of the direction it took.  All the other stars in the sky, which were obviously so much farther away, didn&apos;t visibly move in the sky like this light did.  It was different from the movement of the moon, as the path and speed of movement were very inconsistent. When we looked at the light at first, it looked like a giant 5-point star.  There is a street light that shines in the trees near where we saw the light.  What we saw was much  bigger than the size of the street light. We called a local television station and asked if anyone had called in this sighting. He told me that we were the first.  I am wondering if any Notre Dame students saw it, as it appeared to be above the area of the campus.", "Fast moving, silent, black rectangle seen by military flight enthusiast and amateur astronomer in Laramie, WY.I was standing in The University of Wyoming football stadium parking lot at about 9:00PM.  As a passionate sky watcher, I was looking for Iridium satellite flares and one had been predicted to pass right over the stadium.  I was disappointed to see the parking lot lights on, as it would add to the light pollution&hellip; nevertheless, I stayed to watch it. After the satellite flew over, a rectangular shaped object (it was more like a trapezoid with the front narrower than the rear) passed over the parking lot at an altitude of about 100 ft traveling southeast at about 60 mph.  Total distance from me to it was no more than 150 ft (practically flew right over me).  The object was completely black with no markings or lights whatsoever.  It was also completely silent.  The object was slightly larger than a car but very flat (about 2 feet tall).  The only reason I saw it was because some light from the parking lot lights was bounced skyward.  After about 4 seconds, the object was out of reach of the lights and had disappeared from view.  There would have been no way to see such a black and silent object without light pollution. As a student of mechanical engineering and a flying enthusiast, I can say without doubt that this object was not a conventional aircraft.  I don&rsquo;t know whether it was top-secret military or otherwise, but it was traveling towards the I-80 pass which leads to Cheyenne and Warren Air Force Base about 50 miles away.  This is a night that I will vividly remember for the rest of my life.  I&rsquo;ve read some of the other reports on this website and I was happy to find that I&rsquo;m not the only person who has seen an object similar to this.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I first thought was it was a firework, because of the bright red color, and the way it was decending. But after it had dimmed, it stopped it&apos;s decent, and headed north looking like a red star. I really do not know if the government has flyable flares, and if they are red, but that seems to be the logical answer. It did light up the sky, and there was no smoke trails like you see with flares. Also I could not see a parachute, like you can with flares if you are close enough. This thing did not seem close, and appeared to be at least 10 miles away, although I really can not judge do to being at night. It was bright, and it did fly away north, and I have never seen anything like it... Except Sunday or Monday night at about the same time but over El Mirage dry lake bed area. That night I was taking out the trash and noticed what appeared to be a red firework going up stopping at the top of the apex and then slowly decending and fading as it decended to a red star and continuing on east. I had dismissed this, and figured it was some kind of test with the predator. The object that I saw tonight was roughly 35 to 40 miles south of El Mirage, and I just can&apos;t explain in words just how bright it was and how red it was.", "Floating object with yellow lights at Joshua Tree National ParkMy son and I were walking around the Cottonwood Campground shortly after dark looking for desert wildlife when my son noticed a bright light and asked if it was a meteor. Oddly enough, the coyotes were howling wildly until the object appeared. I looked up and just above the ridge near the Gold Mill was a very intense yellowish light, similar to a street light (yellow form). We watched the light and then shone a flashlight towards it and as we did the object rotated towards us and two lights were visible, though it appeared they were both attached to the same object. The object was no more than a quarter mile from our location, just outside the B-loop bathrooms. The object didn&rsquo;t move or leave the area and hovered just above the ground with a dim light projecting below it in a search-like pattern. We both thought it might be a helicopter but when we realized how close it was and that it was making no noise we were puzzled. I realized I had my video camera with me back at the campsite and we both ran and got the video camera and my wife, brought them back up the hill and started taping. I was shaking badly but managed to get several minutes of video of the object which is clearly visible and close. At one point the object appeared to lower and then a single light came in view in the very place the object was before, it rotated and two lights became visible. We watched this thing for nearly 10 minutes and then it dropped below the hill. An orange glow could still be seen for several minutes. We walked back to the campsite, very confused about what we saw and quite honestly terrified. The orange glow reappeared on the horizon around 9:45 and we left the campground for a hotel. We are not, or were not UFO believers, but I cannot explain the totally silent object that we saw tonight.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Moving fast and straight from E-SE to W-NW at high altAt approximately 2320 hrs., I was on the back deck of my house observing a beautifully clear sky.  I noticed a commercial aircraft making its decent and approach to St. Louis Lambert Field.  The airport is approximately 30 miles NW of my home.  It appeared the aircraft was heading to runway 30L at Lambert.  The commercial aircraft had its nose light on, when I noticed a light that at first appeared to be a spot light in the sky.  It was moving fairly rapidly and straight.  I thought it looked like a flight of geese, in a similar formation.  Then I realized it was not changing shape like geese do. The object appeared to be a triangle shape of lights that were not very bright.  One side seemed longer than the other and had a straight line of lights on the tail end.  It was silent and blocked out the light from stars it passed in front of.  It moved at a rapid pace faster than the commercial aircraft that would have been to it&apos;s left.  Had the pilots seen the object, it would have been viewed by the co-pilot at about a 1 o&apos;clock high position. The unknown object then passed above the commercial aircraft and continued on a 290 course.

It was very bizarre looking; A tiny, tiny speck of brilliant red light traveling across the sky. Is it possible this was a satellite? The intensity of the light was incredible but the object was definitely in space, well above our atmosphere, I am assuming because of its size (it was as small as a pinpoint at arms length) and the time it took to cross the sky (I can only view about 40 degrees of the horizon in my backyard due to the trees and roof of my house) .", "Video taped a Black vibrating object near contrailI had originally submitted my sighting on July 10 2006 with my details and images here on July 11 2006: http://www.ufosnw.com/sighting_reports/2006/pdxor07102006/pdxufo07102006.htm  Today (June 29, 2007) I found a report on your web site which sounds quite a bit like what I tried to video tape:http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56309.html  Only my sighting was on July 10 2006.About a month ago, I found a better way to present and share what I was trying to video tape that day.

It was significant to me because of the magnitude of the object and its proximity to Jupiter, which was low to the horizon and getting ready to set for the night. This object was brighter than the star Vega, and varied in magnitude and color. I grabbed her attention when I noticed it was moving very fast and erratic. It appeared to have several multicolored lights and was flashing at an inconsistent pace.The object would do zig zag patterns and ascend and descend at a rapid pace. The most interesting thing is it almost never moved in a strait trajectory, and if its path seemed to be somewhat strait it would vary its speed, moving in a non fluid motion as if it was jerking. I know this was not the asteroid Vesta or comet C2006v13 due to the comet being near Draco and Vesta has not reached this kind of magnitude, and the motions that this object made do not follow modern conceptions of astrophysics.The most interesting thing is, as this object would decrease in magnitude to the point that It could not be seen there where 10 or more objects around and spread out across the horizon that would flash and get bright, these objects would then dimmer and the &quot;Main&quot; object would increase in magnitude. At times up to 4 different lights would be visible and would appear to triangle shaped and at times would appear to be cylindrical. This is hard to tell due to the fact that the object was at a great distance. At times you could see a flash of light that illuminate thin clouds near it and always seemed to be in the direction of other objects that you could see flash light at the main object. Over the period of 45 minutes the object had moved from about 40 degrees altitude in the eastern south eastern horizon to about 15 degrees, back up to about 30 degrees. In our time of observation four lights were distinguishable, and multiple colours from white, blue, red, and green lights. The objects were still in the sky when I left to head home around 01:40. At that time I had a friend from California on the phone listening in on the event and trying to observer using the stars an Jupiter as a reference. He could not see anything telling me it was localized in nature and was within our atmosphere. I am an amateur Astronomer and part of an Astronomy club that is a non profit educational group. This was unlike any event that I have ever seen. In astronomy we are very attentive to objects in the night sky and see some things that cannot be explained. Satellites and the ISS move fast and with a standard trajectory. This seemed to move with intelligence behind it, interact with other objects. This was the most significant thing I have ever seen in the night sky. At its brightest point it would reach around A magnitude -1.0 and dim out to where it was not visible. Most of the time it would reach around a magnitude +1.0 . In some cases it would cover areas of around 30-40 arc minutes in a matter of seconds in a jerky motion, at times doing circles and ans S patterns in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Strange lights near Mt. Pugh.I was hiking alone in the Cascade Mountains of Western Washington.  After hiking a good part of the day I reached the summit of Mount Pugh where I set up camp for the night.Later in the evening I took advantage of the opportunity to observe the stars since I was away from the city lights. It was about 22:00 I saw three points of light. They were mostly red but also had some white in them. They were below the horizon.  I was looking down on them from a point several thousand feet above them while they were only 50 or 100 feet above the foothills below me.  I could see a faint illumination that they cast on the trees below them. They were bobbing and weaving in a strange kind of dance and they were all doing it in perfect synchronization with each other, almost as if they were physically linked.It didn&apos;t take me long to realize I was seeing something very strange and at that instant I had one of those &quot;Oh  Sh%*&amp;&quot; moments.  I felt very uneasy as I was completely alone, at night, in the middle of nowhere.Two of them dropped below a ridge and were out of sight. They reappeared occasionally, sometimes from a completely different direction. This was mountainous terrain and there were literally scores of ridges and peaks surrounding me in all directions. I was looking southwest initially. Sometimes I saw them to the North or East and they would drop back down below a ridge in that direction. The other remained in sight continuously. They seemed to be playing hide and seek with me and I was constantly scanning in all directions, looking for them.After a few minutes I saw a fourth UFO.  It was just slightly below the horizon to the Northwest and was more distant, maybe several miles.  It&apos;s apparent size was about that of a pea held at arms length. It was more or less round. It was usually red, sometimes green or white. It&apos;s color and luminosity reminded me of a neon light. It would suddenly appear then the light would rapidly fade out in about 2 seconds. Then a little later it would reappear and fade out again the same way. It was always at the same location in the sky. What was really strange was that after I watched it fade I would keep my eyes fixed at that spot waiting for it to reappear but it never did while I was looking there. After maybe 30 seconds I would look away to locate the other 3 UFOs, then just at the exact moment when I looked back at that spot again it reappeared and faded. It was as if it knew the exact moment when I returned my gaze to that spot. This happened several times and it was creeping me out. A few times gold or yellow sparkling lights sprayed out of it. It looked exactly like a fireworks display.I know this sounds like too much but there was a fourth UFO that appeared briefly. It was a white point of light in the valley immediately below the peak I was on. It appeared to be no more than 100 feet off the ground. It slowly meandered northward up the heavily wooded valley. I could see a few points of light among the trees below that were the lanterns at some drive in camp sites. The UFO came pretty close to some of those. I estimate it was traveling about 30 mph.  I&apos;m certain it wasn&apos;t a helicopter either. There was no sound and it traveled in a kind of tight weaving pattern similar to what the red lights were doing.With so much going on I felt like I was watching a circus.  It was really too much and I just wanted them to go away. After watching for about an hour and a half the 3 red lights were much further away and the fourth one was appearing infrequently. I was tired and it gets cold at night at 7200 feet, even in August. So I climbed into my tent and eventually went to sleep hoping I wasn&apos;t going to be a guest on an alien mother ship during the night.I always felt comfortable camping alone in the wilderness but now I will have a nagging fear in the back of my mind that I will have another experience like that. If some other people had been with me it would have been an exciting and interesting experience. As I was alone it was just plain scary.Two weeks later I went back to the same peak with a buddy (no way was I going back alone!).  One or two of the red lights described above appeared again but they were more distant and they didn&apos;t dance around like the last time.  They just slowly meandered around in the distance.  I pointed them out to my friend but he dismissed them at first.  After they continued to hang around I pressed the point with him and got him to admitt they weren&apos;t airplanes.  I could see it made him uneasy.  He went inside his tent and went to bed.  End of story.", "Twin flashing lights seen over Macon, GA.Let me preface this by saying that I have never thought of doing something like this before, and I am a &quot;seeing is believing&quot; type of person.  I also want to let you know that I had spent 12 years in the Air Force, and my wife is still currently active at Robins AFB...so I am a little familiar with what aircraft look like.  I am writing this approximately 25 minutes after this sighting.  Lastly, while I am not entirely convinced that this is an actual &quot;UFO sighting&quot;, I would like to provide this additional info in case someone else in my area reports this strange occurrence. Bare with me, as I am not very good at estimating distances.While stepping outside of work for a smoke break, I noticed two brightly flashing lights approximately 20 to 25 degrees above my horizon look E-NE.  Both objects appeared approximately two to three miles distant, and approaching me in such a way as to pass to the East of me by maybe a mile.  I watched the lights for approximately 20 to 30 seconds before they passed behind a large tree, blocking my view.  At first I suspected these lights to be aircraft flying to Robins AFB, as both were traveling at a speed that I would estimate to be faster than civilian aircraft or helicopters.  I could detect no sound.  Three things in particular caught my attention enough to question what I was seeing: 1)  The lights of both craft (I am assuming that there were two) appeared to be flying in perfect tandem with each other, not uncommon with military aircraft, with one light trailing the other by perhaps 750 to 1000 feet...far enough to make it too large for both lights to be from any one aircraft I have seen.2)  The lights from both craft, at the distance which I saw them, appeared much larger that typical aircraft lights.  They were approximately the luminosity of aircraft landing lights yet not blinding, and did not appear to shine light in any specific direction.  What I mean by this is it didn&apos;t create any sort of beam of light in the sense that aircraft landing lights do.  The color was a deep red, almost of the sort that you would see on a tall radio tower, but much brighter.3)  This is the one that got me thinking...both lights blinked in perfect unison with each other.  I would estimate that the light would illuminate for 1-1/2 to 2 seconds, then disappear for the same duration.  When the lights were off, there was no indication of any other wing lights or other illumination.  Both lights blinked in perfect unison with each other for the 20 to 30 seconds that I first saw them, which I thought was unusual, as they did not once get unsychronized. At this point, I was curious enough to change my vantage point.  I moved to the side parking lot of my office to try to catch another view, and saw an aircraft in the distance probably 4 to 5 miles away, but clearly identifiable as an airplane from the light array.  Thinking that I had just seen an airplane, I began to go back inside,I turned my head and saw both lights again, still blinking in perfect unison.  They were now moving in a southerly direction, and still exhibited no other running lights.  Suddenly, and in tandem, both lights appeared to change direction to the East, and then to the E-NE.  This was a very fluid movement...not sudden, but quickly enough to make me think that it was a very maneuverable jet.  Both lights executed the maneuver without growing closer or further apart from each other, as if was a single craft, yet too far apart to be a single craft.  Also, the lights did not appear to alter position, such as if wings were turning.  They maintained their luminosity throughout the turn...the blinking pattern remaining constant throughout.  I watched this for another 10 -15 seconds before the lights simply vanished.  Interestingly, a second or so after the two unidentified lights changed course, the distant aircraft also changed course, though in a much more leisurely manner, in the general direction of the other lights. Conditions: Night, with scattered clouds, yet clear enough to see at distance.  The cloud cover appeared to be above the lights at all times.  According to Weather Channel online, visibility is currently 10 miles. As I said, this is probably just an aircraft sighting, but there were enough curiosities to this incident to report this...if for lack of anything else, just in case someone else reports something.  I&apos;d be curious if anyone else saw this incident.    I am familiar with watching aircraft, day and night, and this was different from any aircraft I have seen.", "Stark white object flying over Tempe Arizona in strange non-linear aeronautical movements.July 22, 2007 2:00 PM  Winds Aloft: @6000: 70F/ 9000: 63F/ 12000: 50F FT  3000    6000   9000    12000   18000   24000  30000  34000  39000 PHX 9900  9900+19 0512+13 0709+08 0912-04 1112-14 091129 990040 221752 High Level Clouds: Cirrostratus and Cirrus Clouds Wind Direction: West: Six mph  At approximately 2:00 PM on July 22, 2007, I saw a strange object in the sky. At first glance, it appeared in its flying &ldquo;behavior&rdquo;* to be almost kite like, moving very slowly in a very mild zigzag type of formation slowly rising upwards. The objects shape was somewhat circular** and its color was stark white. The object&rsquo;s location was NNE in the sky and about 65 &ndash; 70&deg; from the horizon. The size of the object in the sky was about as big as the head of a large nail, or the circumference of a regular drinking straw. Event: As I was standing outside smoking a cigarette, I noticed in the sky an object that appeared upon first glance to be drifting in the wind. The movement of the object appeared to be in a gentle upward rising zigzag motion towards the NNE direction. Upon 10 seconds of observation, the object made what appeared as a semi-circular loop type of movement sending it further upwards toward a small cloud in the sky. The object passed behind the cloud, hesitated, did another semi-circular loop changing direction towards the NNW again yet maintaining an upward rising movement. The movements of the object itself were not in any way angular, jarring, or sudden; all of its movements were extremely gentle and graceful. At about 25-30 seconds of observation, after coming out from behind the cloud (the cloud itself was dense, yet allowed enough light to pass through it allowing a fairly unobstructed view of the objects flight through the cloud itself) the object appeared to pick up speed moving in a more distinct westerly direction in a more linear flight pattern. It was after that that I ran into my home to grab my camera, by the time that I came back outside the object was completely gone. * By behavior, I am referring to the way the object moved through the sky itself. ** The shape of the object appeared to be circular with other features that seemed to be somewhat angular. Unfortunately, the object was far enough in the air that a detailed description of its features are difficult to describe.", "2 objects change shape....I was star gazing.

I was able to follow it for a few seconds but then it was out of sight. Less than 10 seconds late I observed the exact same thing;  same directions, same speeds, same stange occurance.

Then it rapidly took a turn to the south(right) very quickly as if it was turning on a dime. I saw this object for about 4 seconds. The object was definitely some sort of aircraft but I know airplanes and it was no airplane nor was it a star. The object seemed to be no further then 25 miles away and was very large in shape. It was a oval shape and very bright white light. To my guess and I know approximately how fast government aircraft moves and I would to say this object looked to be moving 8,000 to 10,000 miles per hour. I immediately came inside and wrote down the exact time according to my cell phone and date.Then I went to Google and found your site in order to report this. Thanks", "Bright orange fireballWe were sitting on the patio about 9:30 pm and facing the south , toward the mountains, when all of a sudden there was an orange fireball which seemed to have dropped out of nowhere. It dropped so far and then proceeded to the east at a very slow speed. we were  maybe about 1/2 mile away from it and it looked very low, there is no way of knowing how low it was as we watched it until it disappeared behind some trees. To my best estimation, it might have been several hundred feet up. It was bright orange, and there was no noise. when I held my thumb out against it... some of the orange showed around my thumb. so I am not sure how big it really was.", "Ufo had centre light that pulsated at irregular intervals and moved from side to side outside my window while it hovered in early morning.The ufo appeared outside my window in early morning at just after half past five. I know this as i looked at the clock several times. It was travelling at speed for a brief time then stopped and hovered. it had a central light bigger than the other lights and it pulsated at irregular intervals and at varying brightness. I could tell it was spherical by the lights on either side of the central light. After about five minutes it drifted slowly south and became a tiny star like dot as it moved. During the encounter i stood up and stared, blinked ect so as i knew i wasn&apos;t imagining. The central light also moved from side to side creating an eerie sensation. I believe that potentially i was being observed emotionally as i had aroused from a dream several minutes earlier and had been highly emotional and had cried. After this i looked out the window and there was the ufo. So perhaps they were formulating thoughts and actions however that would seem pathetic and ridiculous. However it did seem that they were attempting to get my attention for whatever reason.((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Probable hoax.

It was really twinkling, that is why I noticed it. I tried to ignore it, but curiosity got the best of me, so about 15 minutes later I went back outside to see what the &quot;star&quot; was doing...that is when I noticed the red and white flashing lights that were moving around the sky as if they were planes circling while waiting to land at the airport. The airports are too far away from where I was to have been the case. So I stood and watched while they decided to take a flight pattern to the north from south, as they did the night prior. The red and white lights never stopped and I could see them at least 30-40 miles away. Then they came back, just like the night before, but 2 of them went east while the other one stayed south. My dog and I were on a walk earlier that evening and all of a sudden she got spooked, like I&apos;ve never seen her ever do before. She just started walking as fast as she could looking and sniffing for something, but it was an aimless chase. She finally settled down about 5 or so minutes into the chase. When we got home she wouldn&apos;t go near the front door and that is her post day in and day out.

We watched it travel a considerable distance in 6 to 8 seconds, from about the 11 o&rsquo;clock position until about the 8:40 o&rsquo;clock position.

While looking at the sky&hellip;its weird and hard to describe&hellip;I knew something &ldquo;black&rdquo; was gliding slowly by the sky kind of over the highway heading North Westward (from me it was about 2 to 3 football fields away).

We pulled over and were planning to call authorities but when we stopped we noticed the object was not a helicopter at all.  The object continued to fly south east.  The interesting thing about this is the smoke seemed to be pulled into a circle around the object (disc shaped) - and all around it. Later that day a report of a fire started to come out in the news about a forest fire which reportedly was caused by a flare from a test run from an F-16.

I don&rsquo;t remember the exact year this sighting took place.  It was when I was about 7 years old.  That would place it in the summer of  1967.My siblings and I often slept outside on an elevated deck in our backyard when the weather was warm. On one such night I was out there with one of my sisters who was already asleep. I was lying in my sleeping bag looking up at the sky. I noticed some lights low on the horizon over Puget Sound. They looked pretty much like the kind of lights you would expect to see on an airplane. I think they were white, green and red. They caught my attention because they were so low and they just sat there motionless. At first I thought they must be helicopters but there was no sound. I estimate they were one and a half or two miles away. It was a calm night and it seemed I should have been able to hear their engines easily.I watched them for a minute or two, trying to figure out what they were. Suddenly one of the light groups shot almost straight up into the sky at an incredible speed. It moved so fast my eyes could barely follow it. In less than two seconds it simply vanished in the distance overhead. It seemed to move in a jerky, stuttering manner, starting and stopping very rapidly.My jaw just dropped.  At that moment I almost pissed in my pants, as children that age are prone to do when frightened. My next instinct was to jump out of my sleeping bag and run inside the house but I knew the door was locked. There were still two of these &quot;things&quot; in the sky. Using the logic of a seven year old I decided to hide my head inside the sleeping bag and stay very still, hoping they wouldn&apos;t see me. I never saw what happened to the other two objects. I was one scared kid.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It almost looked in someway like a man wearing a jetpack, though I could&apos;nt see any human form.   It moved at a CONSTANT rate of speed. I can only guess that, as it moved to the horizon maybe 5 miles away it was going 90 miles an hour. It neither dipped nor changed elevation in any discernable way.I&apos;m still dumbfounded as to what this object could have been.It was close enough with enough light in the sky to totally eliminate any chance that it was either an airplane, helicopter (no noise.) or even a big piece of cardboard, which I initially considered.  This possibility is eliminated by the constants of speed and elevation.((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Then he pointed in the sky.  There was an orange sphere of light with a ring around it.  It was relatively large compared to the small stars behind it.  At the southeastern side of the ball and ring there was a blur almost as if an engine was letting out intense heat.  We just stared at it for a while and then went back inside.

It felt out of place so I kept an eye on it.  On the opposite side of the horizon there was a star near what is typically the brightest star in the sky that was blinking red and green and white.  I was now keeping an eye on the big out of place one and the one that was giving off three colors. Neither moved at all and during a span of 40 min I managed to see 2 meteors streak across the sky. After 40 min I started looking at all of the stars through my binoculars to see if any other ones gave off any green or red.  When I was finished scanning the less neck cramping stars I focused on a bright star directly overhead, then all of sudden it started moving.  I was able to track it as it picked up speed got smaller and disappeared.  From the time it started moving it was gone in about 2 seconds. Completely in shock I turned around to see that the very bright out of place star that I kept an eye on for 40 min was gone. The star with red and green never went anywhere so I&apos;m sure there is a logical explanation for that one.", "object travelling at unimaginable speed crossed our flight path from right to left with a blue trail in the skySometime between 22:30 est. and 23:30 est., I witnessed along with my co-pilot an object crossing the sky in front of our aircraft from right to left at a higher altitude than our own. The shape of the object was very hard to distinguish as the speed of the object was very fast. We were flying at 34,000 ft. north bound over the Atlantic Ocean off the Coast of Florida. Our position was approximately 50 nm south of the airway fix &ldquo;hanri&rdquo; on a 210 degree bearing from hanri.

The object traveled across the sky and disappeared from sight less than two seconds into its flight. I thought it may be a meteor and its tail but I have never seen such a bright blue light trailing a meteor before and I also did not know what I was seeing or have anything to compare this too.

I pulled off the side of the road into a the Equestrian Estates subdivision and looked at this most unusual object as it progressed east thru the sky.  I looked back towards the west and observed many more of these objects coming towards me and passing overhead.  It was a very clear night with no clouds in the sky.  I was astonished at what I was seeing...as many as 30 to 40 of these objects were coming towards me and moving eastward at a very good rate of speed.  I turned my car engine off to listen....no sound whatsoever was coming from these objects.  Most of the objects were eggshaped and a bright amber in color, and gyrating in motion as they moved along, however, several were oval and laser-red in color as they flew over my head and other ones were brilliant neon blue oval in shape.

The moon was a little under a half moon and barely any clouds in the sky that evening. The moon was bright enough to cast a baby blue hue across the sky, lighting it up as if it we moments before daybreak. Theres a star that usually accompanies the moon in the warm season, its Venus or Saturn or some huge star that is always close to the moon normally.

Then looking below it&hellip;is another star&hellip;a little to the left and below it in the sky moving at the same speed. These weren&rsquo;t planes or anything man made. It gave me the initial feeling that I was moving and they were not. So I used another star near by as a point of reference, and thought, &ldquo;Surely those stars won&rsquo;t pass one another!!!&rdquo; But yet they did.  The sky was lit to the point where I could plainly see air planes, commercial jet traffic easily and ID them without a doubt.

She rolled down her window and stuck her head out. She said it she could see a clear triangle shaped object flying North with a bright white light on each corner. I say it was moving slowly, but she says it wasn&apos;t moving that slow. Still, it was not as fast as a conventional plane. She also says the two lights appeared to join together into single object and formed the triangle. However, I believe that was just an illusion caused by the angle we were diving at it. We kept looking back as we drove away and it was still there moving away. It did not make any sudden or quick moves when we were watching it.

First we were really confused about it that wether its a big jet or big commercial ballon but its shape and size didnt fit anything.It was obviously cylinderical and very big even compared to a big flying jumbo plane.Suddenly ,it disappeared and then we noticed same thing on our north side.We were shocked how it is possible for a flying object to fly so swiftly and appearing on quite opposite direction.At that moment, i grabed my camcorder and tried to capture it ,but unfortunately we were driving at high speed on high way,and object was even flying at higher speed.Suddenly we saw a relativey small sized tear drop shaped flying object,again with a haze around it.

For the next couple of minutes it slowly flashed every 3 or so minutes, and then stopped at about 1:10AM Pacific time.  The shape was an egg.  It was a little longer than wide.  They moved slowly across the sky extremely slowly (if at all). There was 1, possibly 2 or 3. But there was 1 for sure, other smaller flashes were close to the brightest object that flashed. It was not very high in the sky.  The flash was distant.  It was a very big flash.

I then saw another light in the east sky going north make a right turn instantly.It was just weird.by this time it was around 5 a.m. and my friend calls me up he lives couple blocks away and him and his friend came over.I got in his car for about ten minutes and listen to sum songs he recorded and told him about what i saw and of course he brushed it off like i was playing.Then we got out the car and i looked up and saw another light it was dim and i said look.It was going south then it made a quick flash then kept going and made another flash. after that we went into my house to record a song.That could of been a meteor but i was seeing strange lighs all night move through the sky, weird.I would say over two hours of watching the sky i seen about nine lights i couldn&apos;t explain.", "We are seeing increasing mumbers of these occurences.

I noticed a star flickering as they often do on clear nights, and then out of the corner of my eye I noticed a blinking white and red light heading north.  I wrote it off as a plane, but kept my eye on it.  It was moving exceptionally fast considering how far away it was.  I was born and raised in an area where jetliners and helicopters frequently pass over heading to the Scranton/Wilkes Barre airport, so it&apos;s safe to say I have a good idea of how fast a plane that far away should have been moving. While I watched the craft move off to the north I noticed another identical set of blinking white and red lights coming from the south west heading in the same direction.  Then, before that one was out of sight, another flew by, then another, they all came from different areas of the sky heading towards the same point.  There were times that I could see three or four of them in the sky at once, which struck me as odd because I always considered airplanes to keep more of a distance from each other than the distance these things were maintaining.  At one point I watched a couple of them pass behind a cloud, and the most incredible part was when I saw one coming from the north heading straight towards another coming from the south west, they moved very quickly and passed very close by one another. I had a friend and some of his family come over, and they arrived just in time to see one dissappear north into the distance.  Within fifteen minutes another came from the north heading south.  After that we didn&apos;t see any more of them. Throughout this sighting I only heard the sound of an airplane once, when one of them passed nearby, however several other crafts followed the same path and were silent.  I cannot shake the idea that they were most likely airplanes because the blinking lights are so typical of the safety lights airplanes use.  My reason for reporting this is that there were so many, I counted at least nineteen and god knows how long they were doing this before I noticed.  Also, they passed by each other so closely and traveled far distances very quickly for the most part without a sound.  Anyways thats it.  I plan to call the airport just to see if maybe there was an issue that prevented jetliners from landing, forcing them to circle the skies for a while.

If you looked at the craft from the bottom, it appeared to be shaped a bit like a chevron.  As it flew away and I saw it from behind, its appeared to be curved.  It was one solid body, somewhat like the Stealth, except the wings (if you can call them that) were curved downward.  I doubt it was an alien craft because it was flying very low and there was a military base close by.

It was redish white and it brightened enough to make a reflective streak across the water within seconds. It seemed to have been sitting there for a couple of minutes before it brightened and grabbed our attention.It slowly started moving away from the coast and then out of nowhere streaked out of view at the horizon. Needless to say it was a jaw-dropping sight that grabbed our attention.Less than a minute later there was a bright &quot;ping&quot; of light that came from the horizon in the same redish white hue. It seemed to signal the original light to come back. It&apos;s difficult to say how far this was happening away from us on the beach but if i had to guess i would say at least a mile away. My friend disagreed and claimed to have seen a rounded triangle solid object but i could not make out enough detail to verify.As it moved across the sky slowly the object/light split in 3 objects and moved apart to form a triangle formation that moved in a way that kept the exact proportions of the triangle.

It was the size of the first joint of my index-finger at arms-length and remained motionless.  I couldn&apos;t judge its distance away from me but it looked to be at cloud-height.  The sighting lasted only 5-seconds as the car I was being driven in stopped at a red-light that had a small-building blocking its view (it was gone when the car started moving again).

Only this white light had two smaller lights, one red, one blue, rotating around it in a circle, alternating lights. I just began to think nothing of it, and started back inside, but my dog pulled me back the other way, and as I looked back up to where it was, it had moved towards my direction, and was still moving. At this point, I thought well maybe it&apos;s plane, but that didn&apos;t explain why it was hovering before, nor did it explain the red and blue white spinning around it. So I watched it for a couple more minutes as it came towards me, and then is stopped. It stopped again in mid-air, and hovered for maybe 30 seconds, and then started moving again, only this time heading East, the whole time with the red and blue lights spinning around it. I watched it until it was out of my line of vision behind other houses and trees. This &quot;craft&quot; emitted absolutely no sound whatsoever. I&apos;ve seen planes and helicopters around here.

I was sitting on my patio watching the night sky around 9pm.  I looked up to see a very bright light slowly moving across the sky.  As it approached me I could see that it was an extremely bright diamond-shaped light. I quickly noticed that it didn&apos;t have the typical green and red navigation lights of an airplane.  It certainly wasn&apos;t a helicopter.  It wasn&apos;t a tea lantern (as if somebody would be crazy enough to send one up during this summer drought).  It made no sound and flew slowly from west to east and disappeared behind the tree line.  There were airplanes with typical navigation lights flying in the distance as this object flew over. The extreme brightness of the object is what caught my eye.  It was similar to the brightest lightbulb light you could ever imagine.  It was more clear white than blue-white or yellow-white.  At arm&apos;s length and holding my thumb up for comparison, it was about the size of an pencil eraser and was diamond shaped. What could it be?

It was about the size of a bright star, and had a large glow to it.  It did not have a blinking light like an airplane, and again, it was moving incredibly fast!  There was no sound as if from a plane, and it was not accompanied by a tail as if it were a meteorite (shooting star). Again, it was near the Grant County Airport, but that may have just been a coincidence because the object looked too far away to have originated from there.

The other odd thing about these lights were that they were in equal distance from each other the entire time.  At no time did the lights vary in distance.  The lights remained the exact same distance from each other. After approximately 2 minutes, the lights faded out into the sky.  The lights were moving from the northwest to the southeast.

The object appeared to be a bright star/light and would change colors from red, white and greenish blue. This was a very fast color change that took place. If you had blinked you would have almost missed it . The object had appreard to sit idle for sometime in the sky as if were waiting for direction . While sitting idle hoovering in the western sky over the gulf of mexico, it would dim and then just about fade out completely and then become super brilliant in color , always maintaining a star/light like shape or visual appearance to the naked eye.

With very little light coming from this very small rural sub-division I could see the brightness of the stars very clearly. As I was looking north towards what would be Midland (on the shores of Georgian Bay I noticed this unusually bright light in the sky. I realized that there was a radio antenna in that general direction and at first thought that thats what I was looking at. But as I looked harder I could make out the red lights of the antenna off to the left of the bright light. the light was just sitting there and I realized that out there in the boonies that li8ght shouldn&apos;t be there. I went outside to get a better look when I seen it move very slowly but hadn&apos;t travelled too far. I listened hard trying to hear if it were making any noise, thinking that I may be a helicopter. There was no noise. It looked as if it were very close, maybe a mile away. Remembering my first sighting of a UFO as I boy (which I have just reported that to you), I decided that it was something that I wanted to investigate. The light was still sitting there motionless so I took a chance and went in to get the wife so she could go with me to try and drive to where it was.

As we approached a 90 degree turn on the road I looked over to the object on my left and watched it move again (slowly)towards the east about 500 yards. By this time I was afraid that driving and keeping my eyes on the object was getting dangerous so i pulled over on this quiet road and shut the engine off to see if I could detect any sound. By this time I was very close to the object,maybe 1/2 to 3/4 mile. My wife got out with me and we watched and listened. There was no noise whatsoever. I could not make out any form or particular shape. Just very bright. It moved again slowly and still in an easterly direction. After about another 10 min. It shot very suddenly across some flat land and over to a high ridge which I estimated to be about 7 miles away. While it was near us I estimate that it was less than 1000 ft. When it moved toward the ridge I would estimate its speed at between 5 and 600 m.p.h. As soon as it got to the ridge it slowed and was running along the ridge at an estimated 10 m.p.h. What that made me think was that it had such pre-planned purpose. Knew exactly where it was and where it was going. The only thing that came to mind of what it could possibly be doing there was exploring for minerals. there are a few cattle farms and dairy but little else. It flew the entie length of the ridge and then zipped at incredible speed at about a 60 degree angle toward the north and was out of sight in a second or less. there again as an ex airforce man and a studend of physics for many years, the only way to make something move that fast and changing direction that fast would be by using what I call differential variation between bodies (stellar)and by controling the variable lines of force of these bodies would allow them to control both the altitude and position. I also believe that these objects that we see are exploratory vehicles which would be preprogrammed for a mission from a distant object. I think this because I don&apos;t believe any living vehicle could withstand the &quot;G&quot;&apos;s that a body would be subjected to.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

It was early enough in the day, somewhere between 1700 and 1800 hours that I didn&rsquo;t think it was a star.  There were no other stars visible at the time.  I thought at first that it might be a planet, aircraft, or a weather balloon.

This time i watched ca. 6 UFO&apos;s zooming around in the clear night sky.

The reason i think they were UFO&apos;s, is because of the way they moved, going up, stopping in a fraction of a second, then going straight down.

We just had our first real rainy day of the summer and the evening sky was mostly cloudy, but clearing up. I noticed the moon partially obscured through the clouds to the southwest looking from Lafayette Oregon south-southwest towards but between if you will, McMinnville and Salem Oregon. The moon was not a full moon, but a quarter moon and it was low in the sky. Directly to the west-northwest of the moon in the sky there was a large break &ldquo;Spot or Hole&rdquo; in the clouds where I could clearly make out or see the stars. I would say that this break in the sky was approximately 3 to 4 miles long by 2 to 3 miles across. I was just about to light my cigarette while looking at the stars through the break in the clouds when I saw a large Oval shaped object move very fast from west to east across the break in the clouds. The oval object was a solid white to aqua blue in color. Not transparent. No flashing lights could be seen associated with this oval object. This object moved very quickly across the break in the clouds. I quickly tried to explain it away when, a second large oval object of the same description moved very quickly across the break in the clouds in the same direction. I do not feel that what I saw was something normally seen in the night sky. I.E. a satellite or commercial jet aircraft. These object were moving way to fast.Closing notes: Each object was seen for about 8 to 10 seconds.  In my opinion I feel that these objects were Not personal aircraft, military aircraft, commercial aircraft, shooting stars, or satellites. These oval objects were larger then commercial aircraft by a least two fold. No sounds could be heard I.E. engine sounds. There were no &ldquo;Flashing Lights&rdquo; associated to these objects. There were no &ldquo;Streaks&rdquo; of light trailing these objects. I would place these oval objects at 5 to 10 thousand feet in altitude.((NUFORC Note:  ISS and STS??

As dusk started to settle in, I noticed a polar-orbit satellite going over and pointed it out to my son. We chatted for a while after that, then started scanning for more sats as the evening got a little darker (I had just mentioned the Sputnik anniversary, so we were inspired). Before long, we saw another sat... I think that it was about this time (maybe 8pm) that we came in and looked up visible sat passes tonight on heavens-above.com. Went back outside, both looking up - and we both notice, at the same time, a fairly tight group of objects nearly straight above us, somewhat to the north. There are five small lighted &quot;somethings&quot; moving quickly across the sky toward the south... They were in a line, not perfectly straight across, but close... Moving much faster than a sat, not pinpoints like stars but *very* small, distinct circles. Not very bright - from comparing to the sats that we saw tonight (mostly Cosmos rocket bodies), I would say magnitude 3 or so each. The whole group was maybe 2-3 moon widths across. My first thought was a large meteor breaking up, but it was too slow for that. If the speed wasn&apos;t enough to dismiss the meteor theory, the behaviour of the objects was - they changed their orientation, one to another, almost as if jockeying for position as they crossed the sky, eventually forming a shallow arc! I started saying &quot;holy $#&amp;^!&quot; out loud by this time, and my son and I had time to look at each other and look back up and watch these things fly off to the south, probably 15-20 seconds after we spotted them.  They disappeared into the light pollution on the horizon at maybe 20-30 degrees up and off to the SSE. I must have looked totally freaked out, because my son said to me several times, &quot;I saw them, too, Dad, I saw them too!&quot;. I flipped open my cell phone for the time - 8:23pm. There was no sound, absolutely nothing. Too fast for high altitude aircraft. No lights like aircraft. No way they were sats or breaking up debris - they swapped position with each other, very quickly, and flew in formation. I even checked the upper air data when it came in later this evening to see if maybe, just maybe, we were looking at balloons (I know my high altitude balloons are sometimes reported as UFOs - things can look strange way up in the sky). Upper air sounding from 0z tonight showed winds in the right direction at around 9k-12k feet (I think - not near the ground, anyway, so they weren&apos;t party balloons and we mistook the apparent altitude) but only at 20 knots or so (which looks really darn slow from 10k feet away). And there&apos;s no way that I could make balloons - even purposely-designed as a hoax - do what these things did. This is the third time in 20 years that I&apos;ve seen something downright unexplainable in the sky. First time was 20 years or so ago - six or so lights in a &quot;T&quot; arrangement, apparent triangular outline, moving silently across the night sky (dimmer yet than these tonight). Second, about seven years ago, *exactly* the same as the first time, but moving in the opposite direction (first time the &quot;T&quot; arrangement went base-first, second time went top-first). Silent both times, hard to even see. Now this&hellip;  Honestly, I wish I hadn&apos;t seen this. I&apos;m still rather freaked - and I&apos;m rational, teach computers and science, design and fly high-altitude scientific balloons, do a reasonable amount of sky-watching, take no medications, rarely drink... I *wasn&apos;t* seeing things and I can find NOTHING that matches what we saw. The two triangle things in the past I have written off to the much-rumoured secret mil airship - fits the descriptions in Aviation Week from a long time ago). But this??

The object had two red lights and one green light.  It didn&rsquo;t make any sound and moved slowly.  Then it stopped.   For about a minute it just hovered before changing directions and heading west. Excited, and scared, I went to the casino (where my parents were) and told them that they had to come home because of what I had seen.  The object was gone when we returned.  However, we drove up and down some of the nearby dirt roads.  We saw nothing, but as we were returning home, about a half mile from our house up in the sky above a nearby farm was the object again.  It hovered up in the sky for a few seconds before rotating into another direction and disappearing.

While nothing has been reported here,  I&apos;m still not convinced that what I&apos;ve seen is of reason,  so I decided to post my sightings.  I am giving a summary of what has occured on 3 different occasions over the past 3 weeks,  with the latest incident being tonight.  Looking to the north (as the bird flies,  towards Allentown),  a light begins to rise above the tree line.  As the light rises, ever so slowly, it&apos;s brightness grows in intensity.  The light will begin to travel east, then, without reason, shift west at an exceptional rate of speed.  At this point the object will hover for about 1-2 minutes with a varied, pulsating level of brightness;  then without warning the object grows real bright and simply disappears.  For minutes I will stand searching the sky with no trace of there ever being anything there to begin with.  What makes these occurences more unusual is that after each sighting,  it has been accompanied with a &quot;shooting star&quot;.  As rare as it is for one to see a shooting star,  I find it odd that after each of the 3 sightings there was the presence of a steaking light across the sky in the direction of the sighting that one one would normally dismiss as a shooting star.

These are NOT any known aircraft. These are totally stationary objects.  There is a nuclear power plant within 7 direct miles of my residence.  Other than that facility, there is nothing else of any interest in my area. We are a small bedroom community 22 miles south of Charlotte NC.  As I face due north in my backyard, FIVE objects are dispersed in the east and northeast quadrants.  A SIXTH is to my northwest (near the power plant), a SEVENTH AND EIGHTH are due west and the NINTH is to my southwest.  I live under the &apos;southern air traffic turn around&apos; for Charlotte-Douglas Airport. To-date, not a single commercial aircraft has appeared to deviate away from the objects, even though most of the objects appear to be in or very near to the air traffic pattern. Also to-date, there has not been a single military aircraft come into this area to &apos;inspect or challenge&apos; these objects.  My guess is that the presence of these objects is known to ATC and the government and these objects are being allowed to remain &apos;on station and unchallenged.&apos;  What other rationale could there be?((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a hoax.

The friend &amp; I were sitting facing east to northeast &amp; I witnessed a large triangular shaped object with three orbs located in each of the corners silently fly across the sky, traveling in a south to north direction. The object appeared to have a soft orange glow about its perimeter as well as around the orbs. The event only took about 5-8 seconds to occur &amp; what we found most stunning was the fact that it was absolutely silent as it traveled. We live somewhat near the airport &amp; hear a lot of air traffic. This object however was perfectly silent &amp; given the late hour, there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of ambient noise in the neighborhood. In the time it took the two of us who witnessed the event to simultaneously say, &ldquo;what was that!?!?&rdquo; the object disappeared behind a large tree in our yard &amp; was gone. Needless to say, it rattled both of us &amp; we proceeded to describe it to my husband. Our descriptions were identical. We then went inside the house where we both independently drew what we saw.

Even though it wasn&apos;t very long or eventful, it is one of the most stark and obvious UFOs I&apos;ve ever seen (even against those in the media).

It appeared quite small (about the size of your fingernail if you were to hold it up to the sky), and no detail could be seen, except that it was extremely clearly a perfect saucer UFO straight out of a comic book. There were no individual lights, but it was completely glowing a very pure bright, gold light (this may have been due in part to the possibility that it was reflecting light as a faraway object, but it wasn&apos;t an ordinary reflective glow; it seemed engulfed in light, like the object itself was either VERY reflective, or emitting some kind of glow itself). There was absolutely no sound anywhere in the quiet of the night. It rose straight up at a mid-pace until it was very high in the sky, then without any shift in appearance whatsoever it made a perfect 90&ordm; left turn and continued at the same exact rate of speed, and just kept gliding in that direction until it was out of sight.

In the footage, there was only one and it was independent of the collection of lights above. If I had to make a supposition, I would say that it was a drone controlled by the larger craft. Furthermore, it appears that this craft remained in position for some not inconsiderable time. This to me, is totally incredible as we live in a very busy city. On one occasion it was still visible into the early hours of the morning, whereupon it appeared to be able to either generate a cloud, or be sheilding itself from view behind one. All this time in the same position. It is in this footage that the craft appears to pulse light, at a slow strobing pulse that lit the cloud and the edge of the window frame in shot.

We were on Hwy. 375 Westbound approximately 3 miles beyond Nye/Lincoln Co. border, about 20 miles from Rachel.  My husband first spotted the UFO from the driver&rsquo;s side window and told me to look.  It was glowing orange, resembling the color of rocket flame exhaust or jet engine under thrust propulsion.  It appeared to be cigar shaped, but from our vantage seemed to be a disk shaped object seen from the side.   It initially appeared to be about  &frac12; mi. away from us and from that distance probably 25 feet thick, (top to bottom) and 250-300 feet in diameter. These are very rough guesses from night time viewing.  It was a clear and bright night, the moon full. There appeared a series of 6-8 &lsquo;boxes&rsquo; on what we believe to be the side of the craft.  The boxes lit up sequentially from right to left, remaining aglow for 10-15 seconds before reversing the process and slowly extinguishing.  It then reappeared some distance to the right (E) and farther away.  At the end of each sequence, only the forward most orange light remained visible.  We maintained visual contact until it crested the range of mountains due NE of Rachel and SW of Caliente. The next visual contact was at mile marker 73 on US Hwy. 93N, 20 miles outside of Caliente.  We were E bound coming out of an area known as Delamar Flats and entering the local mountain range known as the Caliente Summit (Oak Springs Summit).  We saw one flash appearing much further in the distance, due E of our location and repeated its sequence twice.  At the end of the second sequence the front glowing light remained constant, visible until it became so distant in the horizon it disappeared.   It maintained its single glowing orange light and looked almost like an orange star in the night sky. The time summary of the entire viewing event from start to finish was about a half hour.

It kept flashing red and a little bit of green.  The reason why I do not believe it was a plane, is that: 1. there was an actual plane in the sky and the UFO was much higher and faster than the plane, and 2. the UFO wasn&apos;t moving in a straight line (planes cannot change their direction that quickly).  This morning (Tuesday, August 14) I was reading a local newspaper and I read about a doctor who had seen the same this as me, but in a different region in maine.As far as I know, there was only one spacecraft.  I do not know the shape of the craft, because it was so high up, but I did see the red flashing lights and occasional green ones.  I was on the beach next to Mooselookmeguntic when it happened.", "Incredibly Fast moving Bright White Light Seen in Edmonds, Washington climbed straight up into space....On the evening of September 8th 2007 at approximately  10:30PM I was in my backyard  - there were no lights on, it was very dark.  The sky was totally clear &ndash; all you could see were the stars.  I was putting my head back in disgust of how fast the day had gone by in other words, in other words..  I wasn&rsquo;t looking for UFO&rsquo;s&hellip; in fact, I never look for weird things in the sky. Within seconds of looking up at the dark sky I saw a bright white light that seemed could have been as high as 10,000 feet in the air, suddenly became smaller and smaller as it seemed to climb in elevation and move in a northwesterly direction at a startling rate of speed. I jumped out of my lawn chair and immediately pointed to it trying to get my wife&rsquo;s attention.  She was able to see it climb and disappear in probably less than 5 seconds.  Unfortunately she missed out on seeing just how low to the earth it was and how incredibly bright it was before it started to take off.  She agreed that it did appear to be moving upward and very fast. My wife who used to be a flight attendent, obviously has been around a lot of airports and has seen a lot of thing- but she said this was certainly something to report.  It was truly amazing to see something like this.  I have seen satellites, shooting stars and have even watched the space shuttle land.  This was something special to see and for me &ndash; unexplainable.", "non flashing, eratic behavior, disapeared into skyHello Sir I just saw the end of a show where I got your website name, sadly I forgot yours, just that you sit in the corner and run this yourself.My report well rather late than never? I was moving to my new rental house on the night before 9-11 happened, that is the only reason I remember the date of my sighting.Looking skyward south in rural McMinnville Oregon around 11 PM, I saw a light moving laterally nothing any airplane wouldn&rsquo;t do, (no flashing lights, steady white) when it stopped that got my attention, after a brief pause it began to &ldquo;float&rdquo; downward side to side like a leaf falling from a tree (so many UFO sightings are said to do this).Next it headed laterally in the opposite direction for less distance than the first viewing, stopped again floated side to side downward then proceeded laterally back in the original direction.It exhibited this type of movement three or four times then appeared to move upwards growing fainter as it went, I do not know if was a elevation increase or a distance increase until it was so faint as it was difficult to tell from the background stars, so I want back to my un-packing.I know McMinnville Oregon has its own UFO sighting BS and I did not want to get into a loony bin of idiots so I just forgot about it.Later I had two of my neighbors tell me about another sighting they had on a different date, which I will not relate this to you for this would be second hand information.", "There were 2 lights in the southern sky, one following the other, then a 3rd light shot from one of them and headed towards the ground.Two friends and I were looking up at the stars, and we saw 2 bright lights in the southern sky, not too far from the ground. One was following the other one and they were maintaining a very even distance. At first we thought that they were planes, but we noticed that they weren&apos;t blinking like planes usually blink. So we kept watching them, and all of a sudden, the one in the back appeared to divide into 2, and the second light separated from it very quickly and appeared to go towards the ground. We lost the third light in the trees, then very soon after the original two that we were watching disappeared behind the trees.((NUFORC Note:  ISS in formation with Space Shuttle??

It zig-zagged left, right, back over, triangle shape,  a couple of times then dove north-west.", "Four + hours of observation,  four individual observations of short durationI am rather hesitant to post this due to the improbable chance of this occurring within the short time period. However, I have. Earlier in the Summer or late Spring, after many years of neglect, I rekindled my interest in listening to military aircraft communications. Technology has brought many changes, however there is still opportunity. As I began to search for the aircraft I was listening to, I started watching the daytime skies with more frequency. Early on, quite by accident, I discovered that planets were visible during the daytime. I found this quite interesting. I have, in the past, spent much time watching the nighttime sky. I have never before seen anything terribly unusual. As the summer progressed, I spent 30-40 daytime hours with my binoculars watching aircraft. I discovered eight or so high-level flight-paths visible from my vantage point. Additionally, dependent upon wind conditions, there are approach and departure paths viewable . Three airports are involved for these paths. During peak travel periods, it is not unusual to see 6-8 planes traveling at &apos;altitude&apos; at any given time. On this particular day, I walked to get the mail at curbside and decided to grab my binoculars from my car and spend a few minutes looking at aircraft. Normally when I watch, I take a folding wooden chair out to sit in. My observation is limited somewhat due to trees, however the nearest provides a nice shade from the sun to my South. In addition to aircraft, there are many birds-of-prey which are fascinating to watch. So, after a summer of daytime sky watching, the discovery of planets viewable and nothing else much interesting, this is what I saw. 24 September 2007  Nikon 10x25, 5&ordm; binoculars  No clouds were observed in the sky during the five hour period of observation. There was a light haze in the sky.   Observation #1 12:30 While viewing what appeared to be a pair of dragon flies with my binoculars, I noticed an object in the background that was somewhat reflective although out of focus. I was looking directly overhead and without lowering the binoculars I immediately refocused onto the object. The object appeared spherical, although due to the altitude, this is uncertain. The reflection on the object from the sun was not intense or bright. The reflection was more &apos;dull&apos;, almost a non-reflection. Color was grayish. Initially, I thought that the object was stationary, however I realized that I was craning my neck further back to keep the object within view. The object initially traveled in an East to West direction. It traveled about four inches (arms length) toward the west.  The object then made a 90&ordm; turn toward the North and I viewed it for an additional 1.5&quot; of travel. I moved slightly, less than one second, as the object passed behind the AC power service lines into my home. I was unable to locate the object after this. Total viewing time was six-eight seconds. I am quite certain that I would not have been able to see this object without the use of my binoculars. I have no idea what this could have been.   Observation #2 12:40 Having seen the previous object 10 minutes earlier, I was focusing my attention in the same general area of the sky. That being directly overhead. Without the use of binoculars, I noticed a brief flash or reflection of light. Once again, directly overhead. I immediately brought my binoculars up and into focus and was able to follow the object as it traveled. It&apos;s path was in a North direction. It traveled about 20&quot; (arms length). The object was a definite cylindrical, rectangular or oblong shape. It was light in color and after the initial bright reflection overhead, it did not appear to be highly reflective. As the object traveled, it appeared to be tumbling and or rotating, not quite end-over-end. I was able to see dark areas on the rather light colored object as it &apos;tumbled&apos; indicating to me that these were shadows produced by the movement. I was able to view the object&apos;s entire path which lasted six-eight seconds at which point it simply faded from view. The diameter or width of the object appeared to be about 1/7th it&apos;s length. The length was approximately 1/3 the size of a full sized aircraft flying at a 35,000 - 38,000 foot flight level at a 45&ordm; elevation. These estimates are highly questionable due to the altitude and short duration of observation. My best guess as to what the object could have been, is that it could be one of many rockets or boosters that are in a decaying orbit overhead. I am not certain if it is possible to actually see shape in these objects as they travel through the daytime sky ?  An online attempt was made to determine if there were any of these rockets / boosters in orbit at the time in question, however there are so many objects that it appeared to be a futile attempt.   Observation #3 13:35 Again, directly overhead, an unaided observation of a flash or reflection was seen.  I immediately, brought my binoculars up and into focus. The object was traveling in a South - North direction.It seemed to have form of a typical plane or a &apos;plus&apos;(+)shape. It seemed to have form on the ends of the + shape. It was far too high to be able to maintain a steady view through the binoculars. The object was not highly-reflective as it traveled. It did not spin or rotate. I was able to watch the object from it&apos;s position overhead for approximately 10 seconds. During this period, the object traveled about 30 inches (arms length) until it traveled behind a tree about 200 feet from my position. I lost sight at an elevation of about 35-45&ordm;s. In comparison, a high flight-level plane at an elevation of about 60 degrees to my North, travels about eight inches (arms length) in a period of 35 - 40 seconds. At this distance and altitude, the shape of the plane is quite discernible and not in question!  This object was high and traveling VERY fast. After contemplating this object for some time, it suddenly occurred to me that it was probably the ISS. A quick check determined that the ISS was traveling at this time over Southern South America. I have no solid idea what this object was. Again, I&apos;m not certain of the ability to see form in objects that are in low earth orbit during the daytime.   Observation #4 16:00 I noticed a bright point of light in the South Eastern sky at about a 45 degree elevation. Raising my binoculars, the object appeared to resemble a planet as viewed during the daytime with binoculars. There was some form to the object and it resembled a large balloon. It appeared that there was some sort of appendage on the lower side / bottom of the object. Due to my movement however, this is uncertain. There was a gradual movement that seemed to be toward the NNE.  Travel was about three inches (at arms length) in a period of about four-six minutes. After this movement, the object began a gradual movement in a ESE direction. Object was in view for approximately an additional 15-20 minutes until it reduced to a very fine point of light and I was unable to relocate the object after taking a &apos;movement break&apos; for a few seconds. At this point, depending upon actual altitude,the object would most likely have been over Western Central NJ. Although interesting, I assumed that due to the duration, altitude and travel of the object, that it was most likely a weather balloon. I had never seen one. National Weather Service(NWS)indicates that weather balloon flights are able to last in excess of two hours and travel about 125 miles. Altitudes attained can reach 115,000 feet. Balloon releases are normally scheduled at 00:00 and 12:00 UTC with exceptions for additional releases for specific storm concerns. The diameter of the balloon at it&apos;s bursting point can be as wide as 20 feet. As a footnote to these events, at 17:15, I saw a bright lime-green balloon with a curly tail rise above the treetop about 200 feet from my location. It began it&apos;s northward travel and I watched with and without binoculars for about 12 minutes until it became non-viewable. This added some perspective to the preceding events of the day. Again, after spending the amount of time I have this past summer watching planes, I find it improbable to have witnessed these four objects in a single day. It did none the less, happen.", "sphere flew overhead stopped manouvered at impossible speed changed shape and left at high speedi was sat in my garden when i looked up and saw a large white sphere that seemed to stop in mid air fly in a zig-zag in the same position rotate and change shape then leave at at least mach 4 there was no sound and it appeared to be at aircraft cruising height,i lost sight of the craft as it flew towards the sun.this was not a bird or a plane it seemed to stop as i looked at it,wierd.i would say it was very large ,after spotting aircraft in the same area it appeared to be twice the size of a airbus 747 in diameter and the sight of a metallic flash was also apparent as it changed shape (it kinda had a silver ring appear around the centre of it that gave it a saucer like appearence with a upper and lower white dome).i was a seargent in air cadets and know how to identify known aircraft,and having flown myself so i know this wasn`t manually controlled by a human being radio controlled maybe but it was huge!high! and fast!", "Kite shaped probe in the sky over Bombay, IndiaThere was a kite shaped object (slightly curved around edges) in the sky a few years ago. I do not remember the exact dates but it remained in the sky for about 3 to 4 days. The reason I am filling this in right now is because when this happened over 4 years ago when I was around 19, it did not seem as serious to me as it does right now. I was just watching a show on YouTube about alien sightings a couple of minutes ago. At one point they spoke of a probe that hovers silently in the sky and that virtually every country has reported such sightings. This is where it struck me that I have seen this myself and did not realise it well enough that I did.At first I thought it to be a kite. But it just stood there at one point in the sky for days and no stings appeared to connect it. This was very unusual for everyone I showed it to, but no one really gave it much importance. I observed it for all the days it remained in the sky and did not notice much change in the position of the object. I have filmed this object on my camcorder and am therefore reporting this. I would like to submit this video to the appropriate authority. However, I haven&apos;t seen this video since the incident took place. Just reviewed it a couple of times immediately after shooting it. The video is back home somewhere in the video collection of our family videos. I am currently studying away from home and dont have immediate access to the video, but i&apos;m sure if the situation is serious enough, I can sit through all the tapes and find the one that has the footage.The video camera is a sony camcorder and had some 350x zoom or something and I tried zooming in as much as possible till it started getting very blurry and my hands were too shaky to remain steady at such strong zoom levels. It was during the day and the total video length must have been atleast a couple of minutes at all levels of zooming. It is a clear video as per whatever a normal camcorder at the time could handle. The day was clear as well so no cloudy distortions.Anyway, I don&apos;t know what to do beyond this reporting, so if important please let me know.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I was looking straight ahead of me, playing ball with my dog when I heard was sounded like a distant explosion and a second after I heard the sound, the ground and the area right above it turned to what looked like a deep, velvety blue. Something made me look up at the sky to the east where I saw the ending of an explosion of a giant ball of white/golden light. It faded entirely and then what remained a little off to the side of where the light had been was a vibrant, yet misty purple/blue/yellow haze which faded slowly and then disappeared completely, returning the sky to blackness. I likened the purplish haze to that of a nebula &ndash; the colors, patterns and shape of the mist resembled photos of nebulae I have seen. Unfortunately, my mother was inside the house and I was the only one to witness the whole thing. I posted the story on a couple of UFO websites, hoping to find someone who had witnessed the event as well yet received no response. The entire event happened very quickly, but still after all this time, it still leaves me unsettled and baffled.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We were hiking in the area near Old Tucson Studios with Golden Gate Mountain in the background.Approximately 9:00 a.m. September 11, 2007 a golden triangular object hovered west of Tucson, Arizona over the Tucson Mountains between Golden Gate Mountain and Old Tucson Studios.  The object was as big as a dime with arm extended, on a clear day with few clouds. The clouds closest to the golden triangular object were most brilliant and vivid compared to the other clouds furthest away from it.There appeared to be a dome in the center of the golden triangular object with the sun&rsquo;s shadow visible on one side.  Also the triangle reshaped into a golden half moon or dome before vanishing into thin air.Image of the golden triangular object was captured on digital camera and printed on 8x10 enlargement glossy Fuji photo paper at a local Walgreens by my friend, a Tucsonian, who immediately recognized it as a UFO.

We&apos;re about 20 miles north of San Francisco and it&apos;s a fairly urban area, so light pollution is fairly high.  There was no moon tonight, however, so we had a better view of the stars than usual. We were stretched out on two lounge chairs, with a blanket over us.  We weren&apos;t under the influence of any drugs, though I had finished about half a pint of Guinness.  I had a mini mag lite flashlight with me, and my binoculars.  We weren&apos;t seeing many meteorites, so out of boredom I had been swinging the flashlight beam around into the sky in big sweeps. I got up to take a leak, and I got a few steps away when J started yelling &quot;UFO!  UFO!&quot;  I started looking up and around and a couple seconds later I spotted a dark triangular shape with rounded corners moving quickly across the sky, from approximately North to South, more or less right above us.  It had a small red circle in each corner, and was completely silent.  I said &quot;hand me the binoculars!  hand me the binoculars!&quot; but was too dumbstruck to look away to grab them, even though J was holding them out to me (her eyes also locked on the triangle).  I watched it for about 4 or 5 seconds until it disappeared in the haze of light pollution to the south.

When one of them came back inside, a woman working out near me asked him what they were looking at. He said &ldquo;that UFO that&rsquo;s just hanging up there!&rdquo; She and I both immediately went outside to look. We saw, about 30 degrees from the horizon, a spherical object hovering motionless over SSE Santa Fe. It had the transparent appearance of a soap bubble, and was about 1/8  the size of my thumbnail held at arm&rsquo;s length. The woman who walked out with me instantly cried &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a weather balloon!&rdquo;, and went back inside, cursing the staff person for a fool. And it may well have been a weather balloon, I don&rsquo;t know where to look up stuff like who&rsquo;s lofting weather balloons, where and when. I&rsquo;m hoping you guys can do that. Her conviction convinced me for the moment, and I went back inside to shower and change. However the object was still there when I came out to go back to work, and it had not  moved in the slightest, for at least 15 minutes or more. I carry a pair of inexpensive 2x8 opera glasses with me in my truck for observing wildlife. Using those, I got a better look at it, and it was perfectly spherical, not the teardrop shape I associate with weather balloons, nor was there any observable gondola or dependent payload hanging beneath the object, nor any visible tether that could explain its complete lack of motion. It was a calm day, but one would think there would be some breeze at the apparent height of the object, which seemed to be about 500 to 1000 feet. The object remained in place all the way back to work, and was still there when I went inside my building, approximately 20 minutes after I first went to look.", "High flying silvery sphere .Saw silvery sphere shaped object just floating, than started moving north then moved in a cork screw northen pattern and disappered.

These were perhaps at 2000 feet and moving very slowly. I turned onto 14 heading north and again observed the cluster of strobing red lights, and as I did so I saw a smaller, bright white light separate from the group of red lights and travel at high speed in the opposite direction of it&rsquo;s course, back toward Ann Arbor. It was quickly lost to my sight, so I looked back at the cluster of red lights while trying to stay on the road. I should have just pulled over and got out to watch, but this was an unusual thing to see, and I was so absorbed in it that I didn&rsquo;t think of that at the time. As I watched the group of red strobing lights moved slowly in seeming increments along I-94 in a westerly direction and about a mile north of the freeway. As I continued on 14 I lost sight of it. I considered the smaller bright white light that had come out of it and the speed at which it had left, it&rsquo;s lack of any navigation lights, and thought that perhaps the two observed objects were not ours. Of the cluster of rapidly strobing red lights I observed that it in no way complied with our standard aircraft lighting conventions, there were only red lights, and the rapid strobing also is not something one of ours would do, and the acceleration of the small bright white lighted object was quite beyond anything we can do with a manned aircraft, so all of this was pretty non-conventional.

He claims he has no idea why, but for some reason he looked almost straight up from his front steps, and saw the lights. His wife came out as his request and also observed them. Object did not move at all for the entire sighting. No sound was heard. Clouds could be seen moving behind the lights as the Earth rotated. Man took several photos of the lights. As the sun became brighter, the couple expected to see a craft, but only saw lights. It appeared as though the lights were not attached to anything. As the sun rose, the lights became harder to see, and finally faded away entirely.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

They were in groups of one to five, and were traveling along the same trajectory from south to north at a constant velocity&mdash;about the speed of a small plane.It was difficult to assess their size or altitude, but they appeared to be fairly large and spherical, with a single light in each shape. The lights appeared to be glowing, similar to waxing and waning yellow-colored flames. They were much larger in appearance than any meteors, satellites, or space shuttles we have ever seen in the past.As they approached the northern horizon the lights dimmed until the lights were no longer visible, but the outlines of the objects gradually faded after the lights dimmed.

The light at arms length was the size of a pin head. It was brighter then Venus and you could see two lights together with the naked eye. The light was stationary and did not move for twenty minutes. When I observed the lights with my 10-50 binoculars it was reflecting light form the sun and was a golden diamond shape translucent with three lights internally you could see structure three parts the right and left were beveled outwards into the middle and the bottom was beveled to the middle making a straight line below the other two compartments. As the sun set the object glowed white with three separately lit compartments it would glow brighter and then weaken several times. The Diamond shape was more defined as it grew darker. The object disappeared around 7:43PM and the clouds moved in. Witnesses #2 Costilla NM   On Saturday evening 9/22/07 at 7pm. My girlfriend and I were on our way to her moms B-day party and she noticed a bright light in the southern sky, just south of the rising moon to the east. I told her to pull over cause it just wasn&apos;t moving at all or blinking, and it was too bright and large to be a star.Specially do to the fact that it was still day light out, and she preceded to take three pictures of it. It was an easy shot for the camera do to the exposure light available. We went on to the party and once we arrived we just kept watching this still light, but this time with her mom and her step dad, brother, brother girl friend, and last to arrive was my friend and his two boys from San Diego CA. He the fire chief there for 12 fire districts in the down town area of the city. He&apos;s about as creditable as most, and by time time he arrived we had found the binoculars and now were looking at the details of the UFO. My self a professional artist, got a sketch pad and started drawing the shape of this thing, kind of smooched diamond -top to bottom, the bottom half being more of a warmer golden light, shimmering sparkles at those bottom edges(see illustration)The top half was clearly two large bright white lights side by side like eyes, almond shape to be exact. After about 40 mins. of watching it clearly, some clouds moved in and the object slowly disappeared.Also it was my opinion that the object become Even more transparent as before the later it got, as though the sun had some effect with it.

It was, at first I thought it was a helicopter or something and went back to watching some tv. What caught my attention again was the bright light was still there, this time it was a little closer and it seemed to &apos;hover&apos; in place. I then got up, my curiousity grown, to inspect it. When I went upon our back porch. It was in the Northwest of the sky of our backyard. It wasnt cloudy, stars and the moon was out. You could see it through our full grown green ash tree. I also noticed that some of the lights from the other 5 houses were out, when usually you can see then on. Come to think about it, there was no stars, moon or any other light showing but just that one. Also this &apos;light&apos; or UFO made no noise at all. I saw the light move really slow to the right bout a quarter of a inch.  Then it stopped and hovered. I stayed staring at it, thinking what in the heck is it? I called my mom out to c this after it just stayed for over 5 mintues in its spot. She came out, asking &apos;what?&apos;. I pointed to the white light and she said it was probably a plane or helicopter.&quot;Mom, its just been hovering there&quot; She kept saying it was just one of the two until a couple mintues passed and the white light turned from white to a blue, green then back to white. We waited until it moved a bit and then stopped once again. By that time I ran inside and got my parents digital camcorder, my digital camera and my bioniclars. I brought them out and managed to film the white light. For some reason, my digital camera refused to work but the camcorder did, although at 1st it didnt want to, It even had a full battery. While I was doing that, my mom watched and noticed it dart to the right really fast then stopped. I felt really excited cing this. I stopped filming and handed over the camcorder and picked my bioniclars up. I couldnt at first see any good image just that strange really bright white light. I brought the bioniclars down and stared as my mother and I spoke softly while keeping a eye on the light. When I put the bioniclars up once again the lights flashed from white, blue, green, yellow and white again. Althought this time, I managed to see a small shape with the white light. It looked like a trianglar shape to me 3 lights. The other two seemed like it was under more than the one we were seeing. Soon my dad, brother and his girlfriend came out and also saw the white light but couldnt see the shape I did. After a while we just went inside but I called KOLR10 News to see if they knew anything and got told they would look into it. I hope we can find out what that strange light was. I could still see it hovering for a hour and the last time I went to spy on it, the white light had completely vanished.

Observation was made from a train over a period of about 30 seconds.

Neither object left a contrail.", "Elongated cigar shape, translucent or transparent, controlled flight, no fuselageI was swimming at Hancock Point Dock, and after a swim, I laid down on the dock on my back. I had sunglasses on; these screened out UV and so I could see quite well. Clouds were at high altitude (cirrus), mostly blue sky and the clouds were scattered. I had been thinking that it would be a good time to spot and observe a UFO, which I am interested in generally. Previously at the dock, I had seen some somewhat unusual things including one craft which looked like a more angular Space Shuttle with no contrail at high altitude going southwest to northeast (that was in a previous month perhaps about May 2007, and it occurred just after the Space Shuttle was launched that day, so I assumed I may have seen the Space Shuttle although it seemed impossible to me at the time). Anyway on this day I was relaxed after swimming and saw a tubular shaped object. This looked like a translucent plastic tube, slightly tapered at both ends. It was proceeding from north to south at high altitude but below the cirrus clouds. I could see that because of its altitude, and because I could see it clearly, it must have been quite large, I would estimate about 30 feet wide or less. It looked like the general shape of straight across airplane wings, but was translucent looking similar to what a bubble or translucent plastic balloon, no color, and could see blue sky through it. Also, there was no fuselage or anything attached. The object moved much like airplane wings, not along its long axis but along the short axis for its direction of travel. It appeared quite stable in its motion and direction. I observed it for a minute or more; and although it did not seem to go behind any clouds, the object disappeared from view while it should have stayed in view. It did not look like any sort of &quot;floater&quot; or eye defect like that; it looked like a real object similar to a very high altitude balloon, and it did seem to slightly block out the upper cloud layer above it as it flew between me and the high cloud layer. It was defin! itely be low the cloud layer. Toward the end of the time when I was carefully watching this object, it seemed to waver slightly as if it was slightly shifted by wind, but this variation was very slight, and may have been a result of my own motion or even my imagination comparing the object&apos;s motion to the nearby cloud layer. This is really only the second time I felt I saw something unusual. In the early 1960s I saw a green fireball at night, silent, with green particles flying off it, but I had assumed at that time it was some sort of near Earth meteor and nothing very unusual-- (although that was the most phenomenal sighting of anything in my life-- with one friend (we were camping out, and my friend also saw that object). But that was huge; this translucent balloon looking thing was relatively tiny compared to that. There was no sound associated with the elongated balloon thing. One thing I would like to mention about it was that it did not seem random in its motion; rather, it stayed transverse to its flight path at all times as if it was controlled; a balloon would have moved end over end somewhat; this did not do that at all. As I said also it had no fuselage whatsoever, and seemed to have nothing at all other than the elongated translucent plastic looking material, slightly tapered at the ends but not pointed. I was wide awake at the time of the sighting, having just swum in very cold water, and I looked away several times and back at the object to test that it was really there.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was so bright that I had no difficulty following it down as it moved behind some trees. It appeared to reach the ground just a few hundred feet away on the west side of the highway.

Anyway, Tuesday morning (9/18/07) I first noticed what I thought was probably a red-eye flight coming in for a landing at O&apos;Hare. The thing is that it never banked and never circled. It was a very bright light -- too high to be a helicopter and too low to be a star -- that would go higher into the sky (I was facing East), straight up, or back a little lower. By 5:50 it started going higher and possibly a little to the South. I leave the pool at 6:20, and the sun hasn&apos;t fully risen. It did the same thing on Wednesday. I didn&apos;t swim yesterday, but I did this morning (9/21) and decided that I should wear my contacts to try to get a better look at it. From what I could tell, I saw a faint outline, a chevron shape that resembled a turkey wishbone (but with a bigger center at the point) or even the Nike symbol if both points were the same length. I occasionally saw what seemed to be a &quot;jet stream,&quot; but it was broad and short. When the object was a little lower (between 5:30-5:45) it looked as if there was a bit of orange or red at the end, and the stream seemed to retract and then come out. When the object was higher I didn&apos;t notice the red and could only see a slight stream. There was no noise that I could tell, and I know it wasn&apos;t a plane because one of those did pass overhead, continuing forward with a rhythmic flashing light underneath. This was completely different. More than anything I&apos;d like to put my mind at rest. I&apos;d like to think that there&apos;s a logical explanation that O&apos;Hare Air Traffic Control would certainly be aware of. However, I know that it could be something else.", "Triangle UFO changes three lives.I am astronomer by heart and had 2 of my telescopes out that night as I have done scores of nights.

The rainbow rays extended outward from the shape but they were softer, hazier... Then &quot;bam!&quot; it was gone. It&apos;s hard to say how close it was. The &quot;humming&quot; sounded fairly close, but the flash of colors seemed much higher. The oval shape could have been covered up with quarter, and the total flash with a tennis ball(to give you an idea of perspective.) The whole thing lasted only a few seconds 3 at most.And to be clear, I didn&apos;t actually see a metallic structure of a disk. It was a clearly defined disk of light with very defined vertical stripes like a prism. There may be a natural way to explain this, but it was definitely startling to see this.

I have seen a few weird things in the sky in the past few years but mostly just solid white lights that move quickly from east to west when the normal air traffic flow is north and south in this area. Last night I looked up to the sky to the north/east and immediately saw three very bright red strobes in the shape of a triangle. I noticed that the stars were blocked out in the middle and it was just black. The strobes were constant with no black out at all. The object was slowly moving from east to west/northwest. There was no sound at all. This object had to have been either very large or extremely close. I tend to believe that it was a combination of both. I opened my front door and called to my wife who was inside the house. She came out but the lights were to distant and she could not see them. She then called to me and stated &quot;did it look like that?&quot; I looked to the north east sky and saw a second group of lights that was exactly like the first and following the same path. It was once again three very bright red strobes in the shape of a triangle. We watched this set of lights pass overhead the same as the first until they went out of site to the north west. I would beleive that they were military related only because I witnessed a similar type incident in the 80&apos;s late at night when a very strange shaped craft passed overhead in plain view of at least two witnesses.

I have no reason to place a hoax sighting but I have always been interested in this sort of thing.I was in my back garden at home with my partner and we were watching the meteor shower that was happening that night. Before you think that it may have been a meteor, it had no trails after it and was not moving like a meteor would.  I was looking about the sky and at the stars when it looked as though one of the stars was moving. That&rsquo;s the only way I can describe the shape and colour, as a star, it was pure bright white and had very little or no glow at all coming from it.  Aircraft fly over my house and I no what they look and sound like, and the thing that I saw in the sky was nothing I had seen before.  It had no flashing lights that come from a helicopter of plane and there was no noise, plus it was too far up in the sky for any plane or helicopter to fly.  I followed it with my binoculars for about 35 seconds as it flew at a calm, steady speed in a straight line and lost visibility as it flew out of sight over the other houses.   After about ten minutes I was looking about the sky through my binoculars when I saw something else move in the way I had saw the first object move.  This one was a slightly different shape and duller than the first and looked to be higher in the sky.  As it flew in the opposite direction to the first object,  it appeared to meet with another shape and this one also moved but this may have been due to me moving so I just discarded the third one as nothing.  The second object I saw moving was more of a longer shape like a rounded off cigar shaped object.  It was duller than the first object I saw and was hard to see as it was so high up, even in the binoculars. I followed this one for about ten seconds before I lost sight of it.

Also, the time of the sighting requires one to place an exact time a time even if the exact time is not known.I did not check &quot;I would like to be contacted by an investigator&quot;, but you may call any time you wish.((name deleted))REPORT:  In late 1960, I was assigned to the 30th Air Transport Squadron operating from McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey.  I had my navigator&apos;s wings, but every command had its own types of aircraft, methods, and secrets of navigating, so I was provided with an instructor until I was ready to be checked out by a flight examiner.  We were flying in Douglas C-118s, mostly the 1953 model, but with some 1951 models.  The C-118 is the same as the DC-6B, but with a reinforced floor (higher floor loading) for carrying cargo on occasion.  Usually, we carried passengers.  The 30th Squadron was one of several who comprised a group which was part of the 1611th Air Transport Wing.The first sighting of interest that we spoke of when I was in the Air Force came from an F-106 pilot who was the next door neighbor of the man who related the details to me.  In chronological order, this is what happened.On the night of March 12, 1961, two ocean station vessels found an object hovering off the east coast of the U.S.  By way of explanation, an ocean station vessel at that time was a ship which was kept at a particular latitude and longitude off one of our coasts or in mid-ocean.They acted as picket ships with early warning radar during this cold war period and as rescue vessels if a plane needed to ditch near them.When two of them off the coast of New Jersey picked up the hovering object on radar, they were able to calculate its precise altitude and geographic location.  This information was fed to NORAD (North American Air Defense) and to the ADC (Air Defense Command) contingent at McGuire AFB where I was stationed.  Consequently, two F-106 interceptors were scrambled.They climbed to the altitude of the hovering object and closed on it.  As they closed, they both picked up the object on their airborne radar sets and saw it visually as a glowing green ball. As they closed, the object began to move straight upward.  The F-106s followed.In a very short time, the interceptors were left behind and the object disappeared in the distance.There was a mandatory form we all had to fill out (an intelligence report) when certain things were witnessed (things such as encounters involving electronic &quot;warfare&quot; with Russian trawlers, Soviet ground stations, etc.).  At the debriefing, the 106 pilots were required to fill out and sign this form (one form for each of them).  This process could take a long time, especially after a tiring mission (something I discovered later on).  The debriefing officer kept insisting that (1) their radar sets were malfunctioning, (2) that the lead pilot saw an reflection in his windscreen, and (3) that the second pilot saw the exhaust of the first F-106.  Since, the pilots were honest individuals who hated to be pushed around, they refused to recant what had happened and filled out the forms and signed them correctly.The base housing at McGuire at that time largely consisted of units in a row with one &quot;apartment&quot; wall being the same wall for the adjacent &quot;apartment&quot;.  A navigator named John Gargus (confidential information) who was part of the 1611th Air Transport Wing lived in one of these apartments.  One of the F-106 pilots lived in one of the two next door to John.  After the 106 pilots were released, the one next door to John (who was friend of John&apos;s) came over to complain bitterly about the incident and his subsequent treatment.On March 13, Neil (my instructor) and I left with John and the rest of the aircrew on a mission to Rhein Main Air Base near Frankfurt, Germany.  We landed at Rhein Main on the 14th.  After we had checked in to our quarters and were cleaning up (about 3:15 PM local time),  I overheard John talking to Neil.  I asked for John to repeat what he was telling Neil and he did so.  The story he told is the one related above.No one seemed to be particularly amazed at this story, but took it matter of factly.  There was some sympathy for the F-106 pilot that was forced to disclose this sighting.  From this and other indications, I realized that there was danger to one&apos;s career should one happen to ever mention  seeing certain things in the sky.  In the years that followed, it was evident that the Air Force &quot;first line troops&quot; had an underground that knew about certain supposed visitors while the top brass did all they could to sweep things under the rug.I have no idea where to find John Gargus at this time and no idea whether or not he would be willing to tell where the F-106 pilot is - and odds are he may not know.  However, I will try to see if I can discover anything without going to excessive trouble.  At that time, John was a first lieutenant assigned to wing headquarters.The second sighting I would like to mention was related by my flight examiner navigator, then a Captain, later a Major, named Jordan W. Grant.  We called him &quot;Pappy Grant&quot; and he was probably in his forties at the time.On December 5, 1962, I was given a line check from Pappy, again to Rhein Main.During our two-day crew rest in Germany, we had several meals together and at one of them, Pappy related the following story.It was during a mission in over the Pacific and Pappy was navigating.  It was daylight and Pappy had the LORAN set on as well as the radar (which was always on when it was working correctly).  Suddenly the display on the LORAN scope and the display on the radar scope shrunk, leaving only a dot in the middle of each scope.  The compasses began to gyrate wildly.Pappy stuck his head into the cockpit and found the pilots gibbering incoherently and looking fearfully back as best they could from their side windows.  Pappy asked what had happened.  Finally, they calmed down enough to tell him.  One told him that a flaming red ball had just nearly hit them head-on and that he was afraid that it might return.  The second said the same thing but claimed that there were four balls instead of just one.  The ball or balls had been at the same altitude as the airplane and flying straight and level.Eventually, the radar, the LORAN set, and the compasses returned to normal.Chances are Pappy is no longer alive.  He had a master&apos;s degree in marine biology and worked on his own blueberry farm with his wife between missions.  He would eat two large steaks whenever he could and enjoyed good food perhaps more than he should have.  If you have any suggestions on how to find either John or Pappy, please let me know.  A search on line might help.  Pappy was more than just a flight examiner with a higher rank than most of us.  He was a valuable friend to us all.", "Lights with &apos;projectiles&apos; west of Chillicothe, Ohio.At around 10:30 yesterday evening I observed odd lights low in the sky west of Chillicothe Ohio.  I first noticed a slowly flashing while light, dimmer than the surrounding stars.  The flash was at a much slower pace than a typical aircraft warning light, perhaps three seconds between flashes.  After a few minutes, two more of these slow flashers appeared.  The sky was clear, so it shouldn&apos;t be assumed that they arrived under cloud cover.They began to move south at a slow rate of speed.  Suddenly, the top-most light emitted a bright red &apos;projectile&apos; of some sort that sped out in front of it, growing dimmer as it went until is seemed to extinguish.  The other two light began to emit these projectiles, one every 20 seconds or so.After roughly 15 minutes, the lights simply went out, not far from where the event began.  I waited for another 15 minutes, but the lights did not return.  I&apos;ve witnessed similar lights on two occasions in the past two weeks.  The events last no longer than 15 minutes and I&apos;ve yet to see the lights entering or exiting the area where the lights are firing the red projectiles.Could someone contact Wright Patterson AFB to see if this might be a training exercise?  I couldn&apos;t find a number for them that would allow me to speak to someone who could clarify.  The red lights traveled in a straight path out from the lights, so it didn&apos;t seem like any flares that I&apos;ve seen before.", "Triangular craft seen hovering above pasture in Vernon Co., Mo. while driving by it on Hiway 54 in a stormA coal truck driver on his way to work on a stormy early morning drove pass a hovering triangular craft over a farm pasture along Hiway 54 in Vernon Co. about 8 miles west of Nevada, Mo.

He said the craft was almost right on the hiway that he was shocked by the sight of it so he decided not to stop.

I was twelve and he was thirteen. That morning everyone went shopping except us two boys, and am I glad, for I witness something that clear sunny day that I will never forget.As we played football in the front yard, around 11am a mid-sized metallic saucer with a round disc on top silently floated over top of us at about a 70 degree angle and within 300 to 500 feet in altitude. It was large enough to see clearly but looking straight up at it I didn&rsquo;t see much except some round opaque portal like windows that you would see in the older type sci-fi renderings of UFO&rsquo;s.After a moment of amazement, I asked cousin if he would get a camera, so he hesitantly ran after one. The vessel continued to float silently above me at nearly 90 degrees for maybe a minute or so and seemed to be interested (?). I climbed upon a stump thinking to get a better look at it as I was in a state of astonishment and curiosity.Cousin came running out of the house with some cheesy little camera that wouldn&rsquo;t work but by that time it was all over with anyway. Two Air Force jets came blasting over the horizon straight for us and the UFO.The UFO displayed an amazing ability to accelerate!  Judging by the speed of the jets (I have seen them break the speed of sound and our windows in the 1960&rsquo;s) I would guestimate that this vessel would have reached a speed of over 1500 miles per hour within a 2 or 3 second burst (more like a highly controlled fling with a bit of a slow start). It looked to me like the jets were at about 600 miles per hour (pretty fast being that low).The UFO emitted a turbine like sound as it accelerated, but not loud or harsh and as the jets roared past (they were higher and a further away, maybe half a mile) they drowned out any other noise we might have heard. One jet turned around while the other continued the chase which was clear to see that it was a joke. The UFO disappeared into the blue with the jet dogging behind him.No sooner had the one jet turned around back over the horizon than two more jets screamed over in full sprint the same direction the first jet and the UFO had gone. A total of four jets had pathetically pursued this un-worldly craft. All I can say is our military hardware looked primitive and cumbersome compared to the ability of the UFO.And just that quick it was all over.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Since the first evening my mom pointed out two strange lights in the evening sky that eventually took off at light speed, up and at an angle.  Not something a plane can accomplish, especially back in the mid seventies. There were to white lights, kind of moving back and forth, slowly.  It would move to the right, stop, move back to it&apos;s origanl position, then to the left, and then back to it&apos;s position again.  It would do this all the time for nights at a time, when it was a clear starry night. Finally one night when I watching it, it just shot up at an angle at unbelieveable speed and it was gone.  I never experianced it again. I&apos;ve seen lights that illuminated, in a strobe like matter, starting with a large bright white light, to a green, red, blue, back to a brillant white again.  Seen that all the time.  Mainly in the fall months when the sky was clear. My most favorite happened in the late 90&apos;s when I used to go out almost every night just to see what I could see.  I was getting ready to head in for the evening when suddenly a black, triangler object, about the size of a small plane hovered like a kite over my head. It was triangler shaped, black, thin, it had 3 round orange lights at each corner.  It was completely silent.  When it finished going over, and I couldn&apos;t see the underneth any more, it turned on its side, so I could until it was out of sight..((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I had backed the boat into his garage so we would have some light to work by. At approximately 2200 hours, my father said &quot;What&apos;s that up in the sky?&quot;  I looked out the open garage door, toward the northwest, to see a string of 6-8 &quot;orange flame&quot; colored lights traveling in a north easterly direction across the sky.  They were evenly spaced approximately 20-30 feet apart.  I stepped out of the garage and walked out into the gravel driveway in an attempt to get a better look.  I estimate that lights were between 300-500 feet from the ground traveling between 5-10 mph.  It appeared that the lights were attached to &quot;something&quot; as they moved in a linear direction with absolutely no change in speed, direction, or elevation.  My initial impression was that a small airplane was towing a rope with lit torches attached, through the night sky.  That thought quickly faded as there was absolutely no airplane related sounds what-so-ever during the entire time of the sighting.  In fact, everything was quiet.  I made a conscious effort to try and identify the shape or sort of object these lights were attached to without any success.  No sort of craft was visible or heard at all either between or near the lights. After approximately 1-2 minutes, the lead light began to fade and went out.  My impression is that it looked exactly as if a torch had simply burned itself out.  The remainder of the lights dimmed and appeared to burn out, 1 by 1, from front to back in a similar fashion. When all the lights went out, we returned to working on the boat.  Neither of us could explain what we had just seen.  A short time later, as we were talking about the event, we could smell a strong odor of gun powder; very similar to the odors after a 4th of July fireworks display.

I saw it out in the distance in front of us and pointed it out to my Dad who was beside me and the passenger behind me heard me talking about it and had been watching it also.  It was a very bright light in an upside down teardrop shape that appeared to have a hole in the center.  I first thought it was an approaching airplane that may have been their bright headlights but as we got closer to it and began to pass it, I observed it didn&rsquo;t move from the hovering area.  We were 1 &frac12; hrs from Los Angeles so I am not exactly sure where we were but I&rsquo;m guessing over NM maybe.  As we passed the object, it began to glow orange with still what looked like a dark hole in the center.  Shortly after passing it, it began to shrink into a white ball very rapidly.  Either flying away very fast or disintegrating, who knows but it vanished very quickly but while approaching it, it lasted for at least 15 minutes or longer and then as we passed it, it quickly disappeared.  At one point it appeared to have some multi colored lights flashing around the shape but was hard to distinguish with the extreme bright white light.  But as the light turned to an orange glow, which was very bright also, the multi colored lights seem to go away.  It looked like an upside down hot air balloon on fire or glowing.  As we passed it, the object didn&rsquo;t seem to move much but did appear to be hovering a little with a little movement up and down.

I was traveling alone in a huge 26&apos; Ryder Rental Truck while towing my 1985 Cavelier on a tow dolly behind. I was heading North out of Elizabethtown, KY but was still well South of Lousville, KY on I-65. I saw a State Park sign coming up so I decided to pull over at that exit and just sleep on the shoulder on the side of the road near the highway so I could get an early start with out getting lost in the morning, plus I was not very acclimated with the procedures needed to back this monster mobile up. Anyway I merged into the exit lane and turned right onto this road (name forgotten).  I proceeded probably a mile or more down this road so I was far enough away to not hear the noise of the occaisonal semi going up the hills on the Interstate.  I pulled off on the right shoulder, went over a hill and stopped near the bottom of the grade.  I engaged the emergency brake and cut the truck motor.  I was smoking a cig and just getting ready lay down on the bench seat and try to get a couple hours sleep before continuing. Suddenly, I noticed that the interior of the cab was gradually getting lighter.  Mind you, I am out in the middle of nowhere parked by the exterior boundaries of a state park.  Of course I figured it was a car or vehicle of some kind. Damn if wasn&apos;t a vehicle of some kind!  The interior of the truck cab continued to get brighter seeming from behind, but I could not see a vehicle on the road behind me.  The lights go so bright it was kind of freaking me out a little.  I looked out the passenger window and could see some kind of multi-colored lights on what appeared to be some type of flying saucer. I could not see the whole thing, but it was slowing moving over a hill south of me with an approach that seemed to be coming towards me. I could not take this suspense.  This was a moment when I realized that whatever this was, it was a lot more powerful than I was.  I got out of the truck and stood between the truck and trailer watching this thing approach me.  I made such an effort to hear something as it came closer but I heard not a sound.  Not a single sound.  No wildlife, no bugs, no flying saucer.  But I could see it!  It was not shing a light on me as it was just illuminating the darkness.  It continued to move slowly never varying its speed.  The object appeared to be huge.  My perception was that it was roughly 200 feet across.  I walked to the back of the trailer giving up my false refuge because I really couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing. The object continued north and went over the next hill seemingly to flew just over the tree tops.  When the lights faded I got back in the truck ane locked the doors.I played the radio for about 5 minutes to help myself calm down.  I decided I really was exhausted even though I had just witnessed an amazing thing.  I turned off the radio, double checked the door locks, and fell asleep. The next morning about 4:30 I woke up and thought about what I saw.  I actually tried to rationalize that I did not see what I thought I did. I went to start the truck, and the battery was dead.  Last night I only ran the radio for about 5 minutes before I turned it off.  As luck would have it.  I had parked on a slight incline so I release the emergecy brake, put it in neutral and we started rolling downhill.  I pushed in the clutch, put it in 1st and popped the Clutch.  She started right up.  Just coincidence I thought.  I found the entrance to the park further down the road on the right and made a wide U-turn to go back towards I-65 North. Hours Later I picked up a station from LIMA Ohio that said there had been multiple UFO sightings the night before.  They even gave out a phone number to call if you had seen it. It was probably just their number they were giving out and not an official number, but I was just excited that somebody had seen something last evening and they were describing similar sightings. I know these areas are 250 miles apart, but it seemed to give my version credability again.  I know it was a UFO because I could not IDENTIFY if. Nor have I seen anything like it since. I told this story a lot at first, but based on the looks people give you, I very rarely tell it anymore.((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

This sphere looked to me to be about 20,000 feet and about half the size of a typical jet airliner. It had a slight glow. I tried looking at it without my sun glasses and had a very difficult time seeing it. With my sun glasses I could see it rather well.  It moved many times faster than anything I have ever seen before.  It would move then stop and hover. At one point it dropped and went into a spiral maneuver.

It was high in the sky, so at first I thought it was possibly a commercial aircraft. As it began moving overhead, it began to slow down noticeably. At this point, I called to my wife to watch with me. Once it was directly overhead, it stopped entirely. It was at this time that I noticed that the red light was surrounded by four white lights. If the red light was a square, the four white lights would be at the corners, one light at each corner. They were high enough that I could not tell whether they were physically touching or simply in close proximity. The five lights hovered for about thirty seconds. Then, simultaneously, the four white lights shot off in separate directions, each one traveling toward one of the four cardinal compass points. They moved fast enough that after only a second I could no longer see them, but slow enough that I could track their progress until my view of them was blocked by surrounding trees and houses. The red light remained stationary for another thirty seconds to a minute, and then vanished. When I say &quot;vanished,&quot; I don&rsquo;t mean that it moved off, or that it faded away. It simply disappeared, as if someone flicked a light switch. I&rsquo;m sorry that I could not describe the shape of the objects.

I happened to look toward the mountains in the west and saw what appeared to be a huge star perhaps 3 fingerbreadths above the foothills which are about a mile and a half from where we are located..  I alerted my husband and he saw it too. At first I thought it might be a planet, but I had been observing Jupiter recently which is the brightest &ldquo;star&rdquo; in the night sky, and this object was about twice the size and brightness of Jupiter. We were headed to a party 2 houses down the block where we live but after 10 minutes or so  I went home to watch from my backyard, hoping perhaps to set up my telescope and be able to discern its shape.  I looked toward the west again and watched it for another 10 minutes or so.  It was stationary to my eye but just as I decided to lug out my telescope, the light from this object became dimmer until it disappeared. The next night it was there again at about the same time  but I was only able to watch for about 5 minutes before is disappeared again.  I surmised that  the object was stationary and had not actually vanished but slowly disappeared behind the mountains due to the rotation of the earth. On the third night (July 6th)  I saw it again in  what appeared to be the same place.  This time I immediately got out my telescope.   With the naked eye, although it was very bright, I could see that it wasn&rsquo;t exactly circular in shape, seeming to have a couple of sharp points.  When I focused my telescope I was amazed to see an object which was roughly crescent shaped, with the rounded side facing downwards toward the mountains.One edge had a reddish hue and the other edge was greenish but the colors and the entire object seemed to be shimmering or more accurately, waving.  I thought that perhaps I was visualizing an atmospheric distortion so I focused my scope on Jupiter which was more southerly.  I could see the planet very clearly and distinctly with no distortion. Through the lens of the telescope this UFO was approximately 3 times the size of Jupiter and the light from it was not the almost pure white light which emanates from the planet Jupiter.

It was obvious the sun was bouncing off the object and the i would have to estimate the altitude to be between 10- 20 thousand feet but I cannot say for sure. The object seemed to be drifting East to West very slowly over the observation time. In fact the object was at time obscured by the clouds passing by as it was above the clouds.

This evening, as I started my workout just after sundown, I noticed two bright star-like objects to the west, about 15-18 degrees above the horizon. One object was extremely bright, perhaps magnitude -2 or -3, and resembled a brighter-than-normal planet Venus. About 10 or 12 degrees to the south of it, at the same height above the horizon, was a lesser light, but still bright, about magnitude -1 or 0. The larger, brighter light was blue-white in color, like Venus, and the smaller was an orange-red, like Mercury when it is visible. My first thought was, &ldquo;oh, what a beautiful Mercury/Venus display!&rdquo; But then I realized that I had seen Venus this morning at dawn, rising ahead of the Sun!  As I had this realization, the smaller light dimmed and disappeared, within about 5 seconds, without changing position relative to the horizon. I continued to watch the brighter object, and marked it&rsquo;s position relative to the horizon using some tree branches that were off to one side that allowed me to sort of triangulate the light&rsquo;s position. Several airplane contrails were visible nearby, illuminated by the sunset. These came and went while the object remained still. Over the course of the next 35 minutes, the light did not move relative to the horizon in the slightest. However it also, though much more slowly, dimmed in brightness and turned more and more red, until, once twilight had ended and it was completely dark, it was orange instead of blue-white and perhaps magnitude 6 or 7. A few minutes later it became completely non-visible. Up to the point it was no longer visible, it did not move.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Jupiter??

My body was facing East towards another row of townhomes in my development (the different rows of townhomes form a square.) I had my head down because I was watching my dog but something caught my attention. I glanced up and I noticed lights directly above three of the townhomes in front of me (the homes are approximately 50 ft. away.)  I noticed there was a structure or formation to the lights.  The formation looked like the right wing of an airplane except the &quot;wing&quot; was very large.  I initially decided it was just a low flying airplane and I convinced myself that I couldn&apos;t see the rest of the plane because it was being obscured by trees. The lights appeared to be along the perimeter of the triangle or the &quot;wing&quot;.  From what I remember all of the lights were white.  I can&apos;t remember if any of them were flashing. As I watched this structure I realized there was no sound associated with it and that it was just hovering.  At some point it just seemed to disappear and I couldn&apos;t figure out where it went. I didn&apos;t know if the trees had just obscured my view and it was just a plane that had flown away or if the &quot;plane&quot; had really just disappeared.  I remember being perplexed and a little excited/weirded out. My gut told me I had just seen a UFO.  I ran inside and told my husband about what I had seen (my husband was not impressed.) I also drew a picture of the &quot;plane&quot; in case I had seen a UFO.  I then called the police (at the risk of sounding crazy)and asked them if there had been any reports of unusual aircraft sightings or UFO&apos;s in the area and I was told &quot;no.&quot;  I felt like an idiot after calling the police and decided I had probably just seen a plane.  However, after reading accounts from others on this site, I am now doubting whether or not this really was just a &quot;plane&quot;.  I really feel that what I saw was a UFO.  Am I going crazy?

The color of which I would closest describe as molten gold, but not exactly.I was at my apartment complex at Starrett City, located in Brooklyn, New York, on my way home to my apartment. The date was approximately summer 1998. The time was approximately 2pm. As I was walking to my building I glanced up at the sky for no particular reason other then to view the sky. That is when I saw the UFO.  What I saw was what looked like A torroidial  (Donut) shaped glowing plasma. The color of which I would closest describe as molten gold, but not exactly. The object was not a continuous torroidial  shape but was instead waning and waxing in the following manner. The object would start out as a vague dim section of a torroidial shaped object and slowly morph into a complete torroidial shaped brightly glowing object. It would then revert from its torroidial shaped glowing golden like brilliance to a vague dim section of a torroidial shaped object, again. It continued doing this continuously during the entire time I witnessed this object. I would estimate this object to be approximately 100 yards in diameter and 1 mile directly away from me. The direction of the object from me was approximately dead east. The object was traveling at a relatively slow but steady southern direction, AGAINST THE DIRECTION OF THE CLOUDS.  I would guess I witnessed the object for a total of 20 minutes. After looking at it for 5 minutes I decided to run up to my apartment to get my binoculars to see it closer. By the time I got the binoculars and made it back downstairs, approximately 10 minutes had passed. The object had traveled so far south by that time that by looking in my binoculars the object looked the same size as when I had first saw it. I witnessed the object through binoculars for an additional 5 minutes and then I simply left off looking at it. I would like to express my feelings as to what I feel I was seeing. Although I can not say for a certainty what this anomalous object was, what I can say, and I feel very strongly about this, is the following. This object gave me a very strong i! mpressio n that there was an engine of sorts powering it and that it was either malfunctioning or was experimental in nature and not functioning within expected parameters. Try and try as &quot;They&quot; might they could not get this &quot;Thing&quot; to stabilize at full power. Not unlike a cars engine that simply will not an maintain idle speed.

The light was about as large and as bright as mars. It was traveling from the southeast to the northwest for about 10-15 seconds and slowly went dim until we could not see it anymore.

We also knew they definitely were not meteors. They were moving too slow to be meteors and meteors, from what I remember, do not pulsate.

This one&rsquo;s flight characteristic seemed to be like a butterfly in a strong breeze except very, very high up (high up enough to reflect sunlight at about 4:15am).  It appeared to be climbing in altitude quickly also. It was headed in a southerly direction and headed into Orion. As it climbed, it seemed to slow and then just lazily move towards the westerly foot (star name = Rigel) of Orion. I pointed this out to a passing stranger who showed no particular interest. As it reached Rigel, it slowed to a stop and reversed course. It was as faint as a smaller satellite at this point, and proceeded slowly in a northern direction past Meissa (Orion&rsquo;s head), past Mars and to Triangulum. At approximately the star Perseus, the object made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the east and started to slowly accelerate at first. A couple of women with their 2 children came to sit next to me and I pointed this out to them, they focused in quickly, and the object accelerated  to the point that it went from almost straight above us to the horizon in about 2 seconds while the apparent size grew from a small, dim star to a large size star.I have watched the stars since I was a child, and have studied astronomy for decades. The flight characteristics of this object matched no known aircraft that I have ever heard of as far as fluttering, ability to make an instantaneous 90 degree turn at high velocity, or speed.

This facility is located on a mountain top covering an expansive area and the perimeter shack was located in an area where the facility lighting was somewhat blocked for better night vision of the perspective area to be observed.I retired in the spring of 1995, so this event took place in the winter prior to my retirement, though the exact date in January I don&apos;t remember. I do remember that it was crispy cold out and there was snow on the ground and the sky was extremely clear, black and filled with stars. I&apos;m guessing that it was between two and three o&apos;clock when I left the warmth of the perimeter shack to go outside to relieve myself of all my coffee intake and just happened to scope the very clear and starry sky when I noticed a bright light which at first I thought was a shooting star or satellite, speed and stop suddenly almost directly overhead and remained still, maintaining its&apos; yellowish reflection as did all five objects, which I&apos;m assuming was the reflection from the sun, when suddenly another appeared of the same size and speed, and then another shot in, and then a fourth one sped in, and then a fifth, each from different directions at an unbelievable rate of speed and seemed to hover there for maybe forty to fifty five seconds or so, not touching each other, but very close to one another as if they were having a meeting. Each of these lights where about the size of the hole at the end of a common ball point pen and left a slight tail that diminished when they stopped and there was no noise, possibly because they were so far away. The yellowish reflection color was the only color that was noticable, if there were any other colors at all, I believe these objects were to far away to distinguish any running lights or maybe the suns&apos; reflective beam devoured any other colors. You could have placed all five object lights into the diameter size of a dime or even smaller area. I watched for what I am guessing for about a minute or so and then they all suddenly sped off at the same time, at the same devastating speeds that they showed up at, in the same general directions that they all originally came from. I was totally amazed at what I had just witnessed and sort of wondered if I actually saw what I saw. I spent a g! ood hour or more out in the cold night peering for more of this action, but saw none and eventually the sun began to rise and I lost the night sky vision. I said absolutely nothing to anyone at my work place at the time because of the ridicule and possible accusations that I was halucinating or something and with the exception of a few friendly conversations over the years, very little has been to said to anyone until now. I can still see it so clearly in my mind. If I had had a camera at that time and was able to photograph this account, it would be even more believable than what it already is.I was reading some of these reports in this space and thought I would share this account and experience. Just possibly, someone else out there may have observed this same phenomenon that took place in January of 1995 and maybe state what they had seen also.

In May around the 13th at 11:00 PM, I went to close my blinds in the west window of my room. I noticed a very bright light just above the tree line to the west. I grabbed my camera and ran out to get a closer look and get beyond the trees in my yard. The light was hovering in one spot.

I had a cut-out cardboard box around my head to block out the street &amp; residential security lights in the neighborhood, making my view of the clear but hazey sky quite clear. I had laid there admiring shooting stars when at about 12:25 AM a small airplane flew North over me in Oak Cliff, a suburb of Dallas, Texas.  Its North-South trajectory was about a few blocks to the West of my position.  I imagine it to have been following the path of Westmoreland Boulevard.  Before I could see it, I remembered the noisey little airplane by its distinctive sound, since it flies North and/or South over our house frequently at night, always disturbing my sleep.  It triggered the usual question: why aren&apos;t such airplanes required to muffle their noise, especially at night?  As it passed over my line of sight, I noticed something following it.  I first thought the plane was towing something behind it, because the object behind the airplane was traveling the same speed and at approximately the same altitude.  It was so dimly illuminated it was hard to see.  It&apos;s image area was about six to eight times larger than the small airplane&apos;s image area.  All I could see of it was three elongated octagons (rectangles with the corners cut off).  Their lengths ran the direction the craft traveled.  The octagons were in a common plane, two in the back and one in center front, evenly spaced apart in a triangular formation.  It was about one to two hundred yards behind the small airplane and slightly to the West of the airplane&apos;s trajectory.  It flew in a straight, level line without deviations. Either the small airplane was making so much noise that I couldn&apos;t discerne the object&apos;s sound.  Or, the object was making no noise at all.  The object&apos;s three elongated octagonal panels were either very dimly: but evenly illuminated, or they were finished with a non-reflective or ultra-flat coating that evenly diffused their reflection of the city&apos;s ground lights over their surfaces.  No sharp ground lights were reflected off of them as it passed over.  And, I don&apos;t know if it was a single craft or three individual aircrafts flying in continuous and perfect formation. I stood and turned around to continue watching it and the airplane as they flew away from me, to the North toward Love Field.  As they dissappeared in the misty distance I couldn&apos;t descerne anything about the object&apos;s shape.  As the three panels became flat in the distance, the whole thing seemed to dissappear.  But, I could still see the airplane&apos;s blinking lights and barely still hear the airplane&apos;s noisey exhaust. I immediately went downstairs to write down and sketch what I&apos;d seen.  Just after one o&apos;clock I called Love Field Tower.  A recording gave me a night phone number.  I called that number at 1:10 AM.  Someone named Gary answered the phone.  I briefly described what I&apos;d seen.  He said he was on the field and to call him back in twenty minutes when he&apos;d be back in his office.  I called him again at 1:30 AM and again told him what I&apos;d seen. He said he&apos;d talked to the tower and they&apos;d heard nothing from anyone else about it.  I reminded him that the tower&apos;s nightn phone number isn&apos;t even listed, so the public couldn&apos;t have called the tower unless it was a relative or other airport official who already knew the tower&apos;s night number, deducing that HE would be the only one to have recieved any calls about it.  He completely ignored that. It seemed as though he was partonizing or attempting to placate me.  He didn&apos;t seem genuinely interested, failing to ask for my name, phone number or any information about the sighting that I hadn&apos;t volunteered.  I asked him if there is an official phone number where such sightings are supposed to be reported.  He said, &quot;No,&quot; that I&apos;d &quot;called the right number.&quot;  So, I appologized for bothering him with such ridiculous nonsense and hung up.  I was left feeling disgruntled, unsatisfied and embarrassed. Now, that I know the National UFO Reporting Center is listed in the FAA Manual as the correct place to report unusual sky sightings, I&apos;ll call ole &quot;doubting Gary&quot; back tonight to provide him with the NUFOREC&apos;s phone number, remind him to read his manual and give him a free piece of my mind. I saw a similarly unusual flying object many years ago (I&apos;m bad with past chronology) several miles East of Tyler, Texas.  It was deep in the dark piney East Texas forrest.  The night was clear and the stars were amazingly bright.  The thing appeared to be a sharp triangle, only distinguished by it&apos;s blocking out the star&apos;s light behind it as it passed over me heading East.  It was moving too slowly, in my opinion, to be an airplane.  It didn&apos;t exhibit the three elongated octagonal shapes on the bottom.  If it was the same type craft, I suppose this was because there was no ground light to illuminate them.  It was exactly the same color and intensity of the background night sky.  It, too, made absolutely no sound.  And, I was alone then, too.   I seriously doubt these craft were man-made.  And, I no longer have any doubts that we are NOT alone on our God-forsaken, bloodthursty, demockery-cursed, predatory little planet.

He noticed a dome-topped saucer-shaped object with three lights circling underneath fly silently over the valley just in front of him.  He tried to take a picture of the object with his phone, but, unfortunately, the picture didn&rsquo;t come out.  The saucer came to a stop over a stand of trees and search lights illuminated the trees below as if the unseen occupants were looking for something.  The search lights ended abruptly and the object immediately flew off at a high speed and disappeared behind Mount Washington.  The object then reappeared next to the mountain a minute or so later.  My terrified son (who is quite skeptical about UFOs) came up to our room to wake us and get a camera.  My husband, daughter, and I followed him down to the veranda for a look.  The object still appeared next to the mountain. I stepped into the lobby to see if anyone else had seen the object.  Another hotel guest, who is a pilot, happened to be looking out the window a few minutes earlier and noticed a plane flying over the valley.  The pilot joked that the guy flying the &ldquo;plane&rdquo; must have been on a suicide mission as no pilot would fly so low through a valley surrounded by mountains in the pitch black of night.  I told him about the object my son had seen and he and his family came to watch it with us as it hovered by Mount Washington.  As we watched, it appeared that two small jets approached the object and disappeared behind the mountain.  The UFO disappeared shortly after that. We spent some time with the other family speculating about what we had seen.  Because the UFO was absolutely silent, we eliminated many known aircraft.   We weren&rsquo;t able to get a clear photo of the object as it was so dark and a good distance from us.  We didn&rsquo;t see the UFO again.

We then looked at it through the binoculars and we saw not only the streak, but a dark, somewhat elongated object that was rounded at the leading edge of what we then called a &ldquo;trail&rdquo;. The object took up about 1/4 inch of the streak.  Over the next minute or so, the trail got to be about four inches long (as measured above). A minute or two after we first saw the trail, the object/trail appeared to stop and hover in place for another 10 minutes or so, but the trail did not dissipate at all like a vapor trail would.  (Since we were facing west, it&apos;s also possible the object was not hovering but rather moving west to east or east to west after it appeared to stop.) We could see the trail and the &quot;unmoving&quot; object for a total of 10 minutes or so until it got too dark to see through the binoculars.  The pictures we took do not even begin to show the brightness of the trail. Based on the &quot;distance to horizon&quot; calculator on the Internet, we estimated the distance to the object was about 15.5 nautical or 17.9 statute miles.  (We did a Google Earth calculation that showed our rental house was 172 feet above sea level and, adding the five-foot height of the tripod, resulted in a &quot;height of eye&quot; of 177 feet.)  If the object was almost 18 miles away, the object would have to be quite large to appear as big as it did, even though it required binoculars to see it.Our collective conclusion was that the object was too big to be any kind of airplane and that the trail was not a vapor trail.  The way the object appeared to stop and hover, and the fact that the trail did not dissipate, were also very strange.  Maybe it was some kind of missile, but we sure can&rsquo;t figure it out.  None of us had ever seen such a thing.", "Large orange lites in straight line formation coming on one at a time then going off simutaneously, no sound. Bt moving quickly.Five lites appeared in staight line formation, one after the other. As the last lite came on, all of the lites then disapeared. This happened several times.  Each time the lites had gone off. Then the craft had moved rapidly to the north west before the lites would appear again. This happened at approx. 9:40pm it was dark and the lites though very far away to me, seemed incredably large like the size of dinner plates. I called my boyfriend out to see this and we watched the sky for about 10 min. It finally appeared one more time, farther away and higher it seems and the lites did the same sequence of events. Only this time it was moving south east in the sky when it disapeared for good. We both noticed two jets heading directly into the space where we had seen the craft last the one jet flew through the space and the other just seemed to vanish. Last year at about this same time and date my sister and I witnessed this exact same thing right here by our farm.", "A siver circle hovered and across the night sky. Biger then any stars.My friends and I were sitting around a campfire. The moon was behind us. I look away from the fire and above us was a silver circle with a white aura surrounding it. There was only one. It was way bigger then any stars. I watched it stay and then zoom across the sky, behind the house. Leaving a trail of siver dust like stuff.", "strange object over north sacramento 9:30ish pm sunday sept. 9th 2007I was headed west on antelope rd west of I-80 freeway at the intersection of don julio blvd and antelope rd. my children and I saw what seemed to be an aircraft coming from the west with a faint blueish light obviously on the forward section of this craft, but the light was just coming from the surface without being a pinpoint like a landing light would make, I am a licsensed aircraft mechanic with my a&amp;p and am used to even the strangest light situation&apos;s in the sky and am able to figure out what most phenomina are. This made me stop and pull over at the intersection because as I was sitting waiting for the light, the object made two distinct 90* turn&apos;s while still in forward flight, in other word&apos;s, it was still maintaing it&apos;s forward speed in our direction but jumped to it&apos;s right without turning or making an arc, and the back to it&apos;s original position in the same manner. I stopped the car after rounding the corner and pulled off in the dirt, my son and daughter both opened their door&apos;s and looked up with me, at this point it came to a halt directly above us and hovered I would say between 2 and 3000 ft, the biggest difference the object and a helicopter was that aside from the serious lack of sound from this thing, was that as it hovered, it&apos;s movement&apos;s were likened to that of a plate with a string superglued to the middle on it&apos;s top and being spun by hand kind of gently as to give it a slight wobble, the light from our area of town was slighty lighting up the bottom of the craft so asid from the emmission&apos;s of it&apos;s own light we probaly could have seen it to some degree with it&apos;s light&apos;s off if we knew where to look, the shape of the object was as best as I can describe it was semi-rounded on it&apos;s forward direction but fasceted to some degree on the rear area, the object started heading by my reckoning to the south-east kind of heading down the valley, not fast at all but it would hold-up in a position for short period&apos;s of time while makin small directional change&apos;s within the are! a it was stopped in. The manerism&apos;s it had for making directional change&apos;s was the oddest part for me, if you have ever seen a radio controlled aircraft go through directional change&apos;s, it&apos;s kind of jerky and eratic, but still make&apos;s nearly 90*turn&apos;s, I contacted sacramento metropolitan airport but found no one who cared, oh well!!", "Two red ovals moving in irregular movements in a south-east approach.My friend and I were staying in a Hotel in Myrtle Beach South Carolina on vacation. We were in a beach front room, so our balcony was overlooking the ocean. We were out on our balcony (on the 18th floor) because we were smoking a cigarette and we were trying to see lightning as it hit the ocean. It was a stormy night but we could see some stars still.So my friend looked off to the left of our balcony, so he was looking north, and he spotted these 2 red-orange ovals in the sky. Then he pointed them out to me. They were fairly small just a little bigger than the stars, we couldn&apos;t hear any noise from them. They were traveling from North to South (from the left to the right of our balcony). It was hazy out, so they were not bright at all. Kind of a dim red orange glow. At first I thought they were just airplanes, but they moved in an irregular way. They moved very slowly, and the did not stay the same distance from each other. They did somewhat of a dance around each other, getting closer and further from each other.We watched them do this slow dance all the way across our view of the sky, but as they moved south they also moved out over the ocean further (east). Eventually, about 10 or 15 minutes after we first spotted them, they faded too far into the horizon to see.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Soundless triangular shape stops in midair at night and searchlight shines out into the airMy wife and I had stepped outside our home to see if we could view any of the Perseid meteors.  This was about 23:30 hours on August 12th, 1983.  The sky was fairly clear with a few light wispy clouds. After about ten minutes my wife pointed to the northeast and said &quot;There&apos;s a meteor&quot;. I looked in her direction and saw what appeared to be an airplane. I told her, &quot;No, that looks like a plane to me, because it has 3 lights.&quot;  We watched the craft come slowly from the northeast to a point nearly due east from where we were standing in our yard. It had made no sound in its approach. Due to the darkness, it was hard to judge how high it was, but it was nowhere near the altitude that normal passenger planes would have been flying.  It appeared to be above the wispy clouds but no higher than a light plane or helicopter would fly. The craft suddenly came to a complete stop in midair. There was still no sound. When it stopped a very bright light, similar to a searchlight, was turned on and aimed out from the craft. It was pointing to the west. We were both shocked and amazed at this. I told her I was going to get my camera, but before I could even take a step, the light shut off as suddenly as it had come on.  It was on for about 10-15 seconds. Just as suddenly the craft headed due southeast at an extremely rapid speed. It was traveling much faster than when it first appeared. It just disappeared into the night. The craft seemed to be triangular in shape with rounded edges, and had three lights. One was on each corner and the third was toward the front. It never made any sound such as a helicopter or other machine capable of stopping in midair. Yet it moved much too fast for a balloon or other gas propelled vehicle. We told a very select few people of our experience at the time, but most just laughed it off so we dropped the subject.  But we had written down what we viewed: the time, the date, and a general description of the craft. When I found this website, we thought it appropriate to document what we witnessed.", "UFO In Foreground of Wildfire in CaliforniaI took about 4 pics several seconds apart of a fire in Acton, CA.

Both witnesses ran outside and saw an object that looked something like a mobile with loosly attached parts, perhaps four or five black rectangles and several shiny objects held together by a fragile frame. The object proceeded Northerly at a relatively constant speed of perhaps 40 miles per hour. We were able to watch it until it became too far to see.All the time It was below white clouds.

It was about 8:20 p.m. when I first saw an object lit with bright lights.  They were the kind of lights you would see on a Christmas tree but only one color which was a standard yellow.  I was traveling down Ridge Rd.  when I first saw this object in the form of a cross.  It looked to be hovering about 200 feet in the air and was quite visible.  At first I thought it was just a plane, but it did not move like one.  Then it started heading away from us toward Cross County highway.  It sped off somewhat rapidly but not very fast like in a supersonic mode.  I started to turn right onto Galbraith road to make it to my destination but was still trying to keep it in sight.  It looked very far away maybe 1000 yards and then I caught sight of it again to my left.  It must have been hovering in that area of neighborhood but then it reappeared about 300 yards away behind the Dillonvale shopping center.  It looked like it was hovering at the same height, about 150 to 200 feet or maybe higher.  Then something really strange happened.  It started coming towards us at the intersection of Galbraith and Plainfield roads right above Deer Park High School.  But this time it appeared in the form of a triangle.  It seemed like it changed its lighting pattern.  It kind of looked like a stealth fighter this time; the lights were the same but in the form of a triangle.  In back there seemed to be three propulsion type engines.  They emitted a flame but the object didn&apos;t make any noise I could hear.  I did have the windows rolled up though.  There was a policeman stopped with his lights flashing close to the area of Deer Park High School.  He was talking to a male who looked to be about the age of 15 or 16. I&apos;m pretty sure this police officer must have witnessed the object and so did some other people.  The back of the object seemed to be about 100 feet across.  I turned left onto Plainfield Rd.  to follow it a! nd get a better look.  That&apos;s when I saw the kid and the policeman.  The object then started to head away from us again and did a very sharp turn and that&apos;s when the three engines lit up.  That&apos;s when I lost sight of it.  It kind of reminded of the way a Stealth Fighter or bomber would appear but that kind of  jet would not be lit up in this fashion.  The whole experience was very strange.  It ended approximately 10 minutes after I first witnessed it.", "I WAS WITH MY GRANDMOTHER AND WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO A FARM TO GET SOME PRODUCE WHEN SHE TOLD ME TO LOOK OUTSIDE OF THE CAR WINDOW BECAUSE SHE SAW AN OBJECT IN THE SKY NEAR SOME CLOUDS IT WAS SILVER IN COLOR.

The sky was pitch black and many stars could be seen, including many high flying airplanes heading for Europe in the same path continuously.  However, towards the Northeast I saw a bright light, about as bright as a light from a lighthouse if it were a mile away, about 10 degrees above the horizon.  Now, there is a small airport with a light in that direction as well, but it was clearly distinguishable that this was not the airport light.  The light, which glimmered, traveled further to the East in a direction away from us.  I mentioned it to my father, who saw it for himself and admitted that he did not think it was an airplane.  The craft would move up and down about 5 degrees while moving towards the East.  The craft did this about five times while we watched it.  The color was an orange that changed slightly to a blue and red as it moved across the sky.  The object disappeared when it dove towards the horizon quickly and faded as it dropped.", "STAR SHAPED UFOIT IS LIKE A STAR AND IT IS FLYING AT THE HEIGHT OF STARS.

Directly, behind the leader in formation two seperate objects split apart about half the mass as the leader combined the same shape and color.   Another pair exactly the same just smaller than the first pair directly behind the first pair.Directly, behide the last pair was a single object exactly the same as the others only smaller yet.  So they went from enormous leader the first to a pair that were exactly the same size objects too another pair exactly the same size each only smaller in size to the first pair.  The sixth object same shape and color just smaller than the second paired objects and directly behind and in the middle making up what would be the star of David formation.  However, it was solo and directly behind but in the center of the last pair.  The final object was out of formation and off and well behind the pack just smaller than all the rest of them.  It was like it struggled to keep up with the rest of the objects.  As these pitch black objects the shape of giant boulders with jagged edges raced across the night sky from North to South in my window of the sky view I shouted to my friend to look at these objects and pointed them out he could not see them because the were nearly the same color as the background sky,  If anyone including me would have blinked an eye you would have seen nothing, Moving extremely fast they were like a blurr only darkening out the stars as they passed over us like a shadow with pure silence.  Then, I took my eyes off the pack for just a second to aid him by pointing them out with my finger and in doing so I had difficulity trying to re-aquire the group because the speed was out of this world.  Finally, as I reaquired them on the flight path I was able to point them out again and he saw only a glimpse of a second or two before they vanished into a massive puffy white anvil or mushroom shaped clouds that were roughly one hundred fifty mile to the South at an altitude between 30,000 to 40,000 feet. They came out of the North on the same level flight path the moment I saw them dash  through my window of view.

It disappeared and them reappeared. Next, another light just like it hovered out from behind the first one so that there were two side by side. Then they both disappeared. After that, I saw one reappear where the original had been, followed by another and another all the way up to seven or eight of them side by side in a straight line. Then they all disappeared together.  A little to the right of this event, the same thing happened again this time from left to right.

Last night I developed the pictures.The first picture had the sphere at six, to the left of the  moon (at the 9 postion) is what appears to be a chain of gold/metallic spheres linked together and curved.  There are what appear to be additional gold/metallic spheres on the roof the house behind mine.  To the right at roof line is a very large bright light in what appears to be a street light.In the second picture the blue sphere is at the 5 position.  The chain of spheres is below and behind the blue sphere, again at the 5 position.  It now looks straight.  The spheres on  the roof have moved to the right.  The street light has moved from the right of a tree or roof  toward the left so that it is now in the middle of that.

This is the time that the photo in question was taken, however I did not take the photo knowing there was an unidentifiable object in the frame. This discovery was made hours later while reviewing the photos I took earlier today with a friend. My friend noticed the strange object in the corner of the photograph. The picture captured an airplane flying below and to the left of the UFO. The photograph is from an angle directed at the sky (I was taking pictures of clouds). In the photo there is a clearly identifiable airplane in the lower left hand corner of the picture. In the top right of the photo is the UFO in question. I would like to submit this photo to you for your own inspection. I do not know what this object is, but given the distance of the identifiable airplane I feel an approximate size and distance comparison can be concluded provided your expertise.I think it is important to mention that this surrounding area is nearby Boeing Field, in Everett, Washington and many planes fly over this area. Despite this fact, the unidentifiable object in question poses a significant enough impression that my friend and I feel this should be handed over to you for further review.Thank you for your time.", "I noticed a white circle moving slowly at a constant speed in the sky.  It&apos;s possible that it could have been an oval.  It was fairly small, but not too small.  I definately saw something.  At first it seemed to me that it could be something normal, but then after it moved slowly for about 10 seconds it faded quickly into the sky.  Judging by how far away it must have been, that ship must have been very large.  I think it went back into space quickly.", "HostileThere was a circle disk flying over a close up plane then it shot forward into another plane a long way away and then left a huge streak across the sky as it left to.", "While on vacation, at 04:40 early in the morning I observed a triangular lighted object tracking north to south stopping several times suspended still.  The size is what got my attention, as it became closer I was able to identify that it indeed was one object and not several lights together.  It was completely silent, gliding if you will to the south just over the Atlantic Ocean. I would estimate its size of being 200&apos;x200&apos;x200.  From a stopped position, to moving, there wasn&apos;t any noise nor lateral movement upon acceleration.  Object left from sight on south-easterly direction.", "Daylight sighting of disc shaped object performing impossible maneuversI was driving south on I-71 traveling from Cleveland to Columbus, OH.  The sky was sunny and clear.  I looked to my left and there was an object that appeared to be an airplane, but it was pointed downward at about 120 degree angle.  I was concerned because I did not know of an airstrip nearby and the angle looked too severe to be anything but landing.  As I watched, I noticed that it was not descending, but rather flying in a straight direction roughly parallel to me, maintaining a consistent distance from the tree line below it. At that point, my phone rang and I answered it.  After a minute or so I looked over to see where the object had gone and did not see it immediately.  As I scanned the area I saw a dark dot on the horizon and in the matter of a couple of seconds the &quot;dot&quot; grew into the object, as if it had been a great distance away and then shot back to my location.  It then began to travel parallel to me again at the same unusual angle.  At this time the object seemed to flutter and I was able to briefly see that it was disc shaped, no wings, with a smaller, raised, flat area on top.  I could not tell if this part was also disc shaped, but it definitely was not dome shaped.  Throughout the sighting It seemed like the object was slightly blurry despite the fact that the surrounding area was perfectly clear.  The color was dark and metallic looking. I continued to view it for about a minute until the terrain began to get a little hilly and I lost it behind the tree line.  At no time did I hear any noise.  The distance was difficult to guage, but the trees looked to be about .5 miles away.  It appeared to be about the size of a cessna aircraft.  There were no other aircraft spotted at the time.

She wanted to go to the store so the two of us walked about 2 blocks over to the local bodega. We were walking back and for some reason, I caught myself looking down at the ground. I remembered being told not to look down, and so I shifted my eyes to the horizon. It did occur to me to not only look at the horizon, but to check out the stars while I was at it. We were crossing the street, and I looked straight up as far as I could see. Suddenly, I tugged at my mother&apos;s hand and pulled her further into the street; &quot;Look, Look!&quot; I shouted as she pulled back on me. What I saw in that moment was a HUGE metal disk with bright lights all over it. It was suddenly hovering right over us. You could not see the sky it was so close. When she looked up, she yanked me back with the most chilling grasp, close to her waistline. I can still hear the desparate breath she took. Once I shouted look and was yanked back, I noticed everyone in the street stopped and was staring up at the sky. Once I looked back up again, it was gone, and everyone started walking again as if nothing had happened. The next day, when I went outside I heard nothing of the incident from adults. I knew of the news at the time, but was too young to understand what time it came on t.v. Years had passed and I never forgot what happened, but as I aged I began to question if it was a dream. My mom and I had never discussed it after that night. I approached her one day and asked her if it was true we had seen a UFO. She sounded annoyed and said &quot;Yes!&quot; (she is not fond of such topics). I told her I did not beleive her, she was just trying to appease me, and asked her to recount her story. Here is what she said: &quot;I looked up and saw the UFO and lights, I was scared so I pulled you closer.&quot; I told her that when she pulled me closer, I looked around at everyone else looking up. I asked her what happened in that moment because when i looked back up the ufo was gone. &quot;The UFO ascended into the air, and sped off, like a bright white light, it just disappeared.

We arrived at Borrego around 5 pm, and decided to backpack at Culp Valley Campground.  Culp Valley is approximately 3500 feet in elevation overlooking the Borrego Desert.  We backpacked about 1/2 mile from the trailhead and set up our tent about 20 feet north of the trail. Nightfall began and I couldn&apos;t sleep.  At around 3 am I heard a male voice conversing with someone or something.  I was startled by this realization and sitting in the tent I looked into the direction (about 50 yards from my tent) of the chatter and witnessed a green light moving back and forth.  I noticed the green light was coming closer and closer to the trail near where my tent was located.  I immediately ducked down in my tent and peered out in the front portion of my tent.  I noticed a mass gathering of people (12-15) or beings following the leader holding the green light.  I was terrified asking myself why people were hiking the trail at 3am in the desert.  I quickly took a glance of the party of beings walking past my tent.  I witnessed really tall beings and really short beings wearing white robes holding metal rods with light emitting from the rods.  These beings had bald heads wearing white robes walking very very quietly and slow....with their heads looking left to right with each footstep.  The little beings had robes on and I noticed their long arms swaying back and forth in unison with their feet. The thing that surprised me was the minimal noise I heard during their walk past my tent.  I&apos;ve backpacked far too often to hear footsteps of people walking near or around my tent.  It didn&apos;t happen in this instance.  The beings reluctantly continued on the trail and the bright lights slowly faded away.  I was panicking during the whole episode and waited 10 minutes to wake my girlfriend up to inform her of my observations.  The next morning I ran down to the trail to gather any form of evidence.  Unfortunately I didn&apos;t find anything that was peculiar.  The next day I made a call to the park ranger giving him my account of what happened.  He came up with two theories.  Night scientists or a religious cult.  I personally think it was a ranger guiding extraterrestrials into our natural habitat.", "Floating red object over local baseball field.Very large, about twice a football field.

I was flying toward Houston. Between 6 and 7pm. I saw a black &quot;toothpick&quot; streak in the foreground of a large white cloud, making it extremely vivid. My camera ran out of batteries about an hour before this happened!  As our vantage point changed, I became aware that the streak was a kind of jet stream. The vessel looked very much like one I&apos;ve seen in Star Wars, with vertical curved wings, and a horizontal deck/cockpit. It was black. It was flying at close to our exact altitude. It didn&apos;t sink in that I had likely seen a UFO and needed to report it until I told a friend about it. I observed the vessel for about 1.5 minutes as we approached, 1 minute as we passed it&apos;s front, and less than another minute before we flew out of my visual range. It looked as if it were less than a quarter mile from the plane, but it&apos;s hard to tell in the air. The cloud as a back drop helped a lot. I was hard to tell if it was moving until we passed it a little, and then I could see the jet stream very clearly.

What I captured initially were just routine fighter jets, when I played back the video, I saw a white light in the upper right corner of the frame. As I played the video from the beginning frame by frame, I noticed a single dot entering the frame converging with the second jet. In the next frame it appeared to go through the fighter jet forming black dots in the next frame above and below the jet, in the next frame three black dots appear  perfectly triangulating in close proximity around the jet. In the next frame they seem to have scattered. In the next few frames a light appears in the upper right corner of the frame, camera then goes out of view of object, camera steadies and in the next few frames a white light is seen again in the upper right corner descending rapidly, it goes out of focus for some frames until it is seen again, as a black dot converging with the fourth fighter jet. Then as soon as it converges in the next few frames is seen rapidly fleeing away at an ascending angle, the final image capture shows black dot above a previously unseen unknown object.

The distance between them never changed and their trajectory was identical their speed seemed to be identical to each other.", "A silent anomalous array of 3 white lights some 15-20 feet across flew south along US 5 at no more than 50 feet elevationThe second sighting was full of apparent ambiguity. An hour after the first sighting I was on Highway 5 driving north at 70 miles per hour through the San Joaquin Valley. This enormous expanse of agribusiness territory has few settlements along the freeway. It is a desolate area with dry unpopulated low lying hills la short distance to the west To the east as far as the eye can see stretches desert transformed by irrigation into large industrialized farms. Moving perpendicular to the highway I saw a faint red light crossing from right to left over the Interstate. It was perhaps half a mile away and from its speed and elevation, about fifty feet above the road, I immediately assumed that the red light was the tail light of a car on a freeway overpass. This impression was reinforced when after crossing the freeway the red light became a faint white one, as if I were now viewing a vehicle that had turned left from the overpass and was heading down towards me on an onramp in order to merge with the southbound traffic. I immediately noticed that there was something wrong with this &quot;car.&quot;  Instead of the usual headlight configuration of two, there were three discrete white lights. They initially appeared quite faint in the distance. They were moving down towards me on what I assumed was an onramp. Traveling at about 100 feet per second I was rapidly closing with the lights that were arrayed equidistant from one another in a straight line parallel to the ground. The distance between them was fixed. I quickly realized that they were attached to something much larger than an ordinary car or truck. The light array covered a distance of at least 15 to 20 feet. My mind raced for possible explanations. Perhaps the three white lights were attached to some kind of large construction or agricultural vehicle that was lumbering down the onramp to get on the freeway. Or maybe it was on a side road adjacent to the Interstate. Why such an oversized vehicle would be cruising about at nearly 3 AM when driver fatigue and poor visibility would make such driving particularly dangerous was beyond me. As I moved steadily closer, the light array suddenly became much brighter. They did not look like headlights at all, but rather like  landing lights of a small plane. As if to confirm this notion, the three lights titled sideways, lifted off the road and then headed up into the sky at a sharp angle. This was crazy! What would a small aircraft be doing flying so close to the ground along a busy Interstate in the middle of the night? It didn&rsquo;t make any sense at all. As the object that I assumed was attached to the array headed into the sky, I suddenly could no longer see the three white lights. Instead where they had been last seen was now just a solitary motionless red light. It seemed to be hovering some 50 feet off the ground and was just sort of stuck there in the sky a few dozen yards to the west of the highway. I was able to see this strange unblinking red light for only a few seconds as I speed by headed north. The thought occurred to me that perhaps I had just seen a crop duster. On rare occasion during the day crop dusters can be seen flying along US 5. They are quite noisy and I believe they move a speed of no less than 80 miles per hour. The object that I had just seen was totally silent. In addition I estimate its speed to have been no more than 30 miles per hour. Its slow approach was one of the reasons why I had assumed it was on some kind of highway onramp. The unknown objects sharp upward turn with its nose pointing practically straight up  is not consistent with the flight characteristics of a small plane. The entire sighting lasted no more twenty or thirty seconds. As I drove off I carefully noted that there was no overpass above the highway. There was no ramp on which the triad of lights might have possibly descended. Whatever I had seen crossing over the freeway at the beginning of the sighting must have been airborne.", "Object changes colour and moves at amazing speeds.I&rsquo;m a taxi driver. Two weeks ago me and a customer saw a very bright light. It was like a spotlight in the sky not moving like a normal plain or helicopter holding altitude but not in space but near to earth. The light was remarkable it shimmered and was a brilliant light so clear. My customer was so amazed by it we followed it. But it zipped off and that was it. Then on the 14th day of  the 9th  Month in 2007 I saw the same light again over the same area. I had my digital camera on me and I took one still image of the object and a half hour video of it,  I think it the best footage of a ufo iv ever seen. When I zoom in you can see a circle with the flat side at the top and the shape of the craft is like a doughnut. After looking at the Video footage of the space shuttle video I believe it&rsquo;s the same type of craft but cant be sure. The centre is concave or indented and you can almost make out the panels on the craft. It is self-illuminating with some kind of energy field running over the skin of the Craft. Every now and then it starts to shimmer the energy grows and it moves at an amazing speed and turns in to a blur moving about so fast it gives the impression of a slinky or a snake moving and changing colours. Brilliant white, electric blue, purple, red and green. It then slows down stops and goes back to normal it kind of vibrates or moves so fast it looks like it is vibrating. It did this several times until I ran our of battery I caught all this on my hard drive cam recorder the Sony DCR &ndash;SR72E.

With the ocean to our left. The view directly in front of us was a parking lot, approx. 50 yards across, and another building of the condo complex.

It seemed to be right over top of the building which was about 50 yards away and maybe 40-60 feet above the building. Very close. There was no arch to its path it was almost horizontal. Just at a slight downward path. I don&rsquo;t know what I saw but I cannot imagine what it could have been.

They were afraid to drive the rest of the way home alone, so I followed them in my car. When we reached their home and looked to the east, we saw three objects hovering above a field behind our grandmother&apos;s home. They were in a triangle formation, with two on top and one on the bottom. We sat on my cousin&apos;s porch and watched them for a few hours. During that time, every so often they would swap positions, reversing the triangle. They had mainly white lights, but those changed periodically to orange. When I left, one of them broke away and stayed parallel to my car the entire length of the road (about a mile). I turned right, and it did the same. It remained beside me, just above the trees, until I met a car a half a mile later. Then it did a 180-degree turn and followed that car. My cousins said the other two left in the same direction I drove a few minutes after my departure. We never saw them again, but there were other reported sightings in our area that summer.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I looked out of my bedroom balcony toward the mountains. I looked up into the sky and saw what appeared to be a &quot;white&quot; (colored) object.  It&apos;s shape is difficult to discern, but it was a solid mass, a compact object, with no wings (like an airplane), no propellers, just a mass moving at a very, very slow speed giving an appearance that it was hovering. What immediately struck me as odd about this object was the rate of speed by which it moved.  I have never seen an object move that slow in the air, like at a snails pace. I observed the object for about 15 seconds, then turned way. When I looked back, I could not find the object in the sky, it simply disappeared from the morning blue sky. The best I can describe it&apos;s flying altitude is that it was significantly higher than what a helicopter typically flies, and lower than a high altitude plane (the ones that leave a cloud like trail).  So, it&apos;s shape is difficult to identify. All i can say is that it was unidentified, it was flying (hovering), and it was an object.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We were out in the middle of nowhere, not knowing where we were apart from the fact that it was en route to irvine. They thought it was rather strange that the smell would be so prominent in the middle of the night, when we&apos;re surrounded by nothing but hills. Soon after, everyone in the car started exclaiming, &apos;omg, wth is that?! look at that!?&quot; from the corner of my eyes, all I could see were lights. It looked like a car was coming from a merging lane. When I actually looked over, i saw this triangular shaped aircraft. It had two lights, and was tilted at a 45 degree angle. It was flying at the same level as us, as if it were a car. And then, for some incomprehensible reason, this unidentified aircraft flew right in front of us, cutting us off. I was driving at 80 miles per hour, and was forced to brake.It might sound bizarre and a little egotistical, but it really, really, really, seemed like it was out to get us. It pretty much intercepted us. changed directions right when it came in front of us. And when it was ahead of us, it took off, and decided to head towards the sky.It made no noise.

The sky was slightly light-colored and not sharply clear (e.g., not intensely black with entire Milky Way in view), but stars, planets and high-flying airliners and their distinctive running lights were clearly visible.  There was no precipitation, no fog and no moon out at the time. I stood facing south, looking at the stars and planets in the sky. All of a sudden, I heard a roar over my right shoulder (i.e., from the north).  I turned toward the sound. The roar stopped abruptly and I saw that there was an object in the sky almost directly overhead - actually west of my position by no more than 700 feet.  It had an altitude of about 1,000 feet and seemed to be a solid black object, triangular in shape, and having three white lights, each at the object&rsquo;s extremities in a triangular pattern, with a centered red light, blinking regularly and somewhat hurriedly.  As it moved away, the blinking red light made at least one white light appear to be blinking as well &ndash; an optical illusion?  The object could be blocked from view by a nickel held at arm&rsquo;s length. The shape, size and black color were confirmed by how the object blocked the sky and stars from view. The craft moved quite slowly, smoothly and silently.  Its speed was significantly less than a typical small aircraft; a car would have very easily overtaken it. It was clearly not a helicopter. The object flew south/southwest and could easily be seen for at least 3-4 miles.  As it flew, its altitude was even more clearly seen to be about 1,000 feet. It was the lowest object in the sky. As it moved southward, the sky and land below and to the east of its path twice glowed with soft diffused white light; however perhaps this could be explained as being the result of weather anomalies, particularly as there was no clear view of any light beam emanating from the object.

There were some odd cloud formations that I thought would be cool to post as stock on my Deviant Art account. I got a few pictures of some planes with their vapor trails from the cooling weather and when I looked over into the eastern part of the southern sky, I saw something odd.There was a very bright object in the sky, about the size of a large blimp, moving slowly through the sky. I say it was odd because not only was it so bright compared to the planes I had been photographing, but it also had no vapor trail. None of the other planes were without one. So I took a few pictures of it. I should have clicked my camera, a Nikon Coolpix 4200 to video, but I wasn&apos;t sure what I was seeing. I watched it for about 2 minutes, then went inside to tell my wife and mother about it. I was only inside maybe 15-20 seconds. When I stepped back out it had gone. At the original rate it was moving, had it held constant, it shouldn&apos;t have gone very far in that time. And if it was a plane, it should still have been in view in the areaI was looking in. But there was nothing.I went back inside and began looking at the pictures. The first one I looked at had everyone blinking in shock. As I zoomed in you could see the object, no vapor trail visible, and you could see from the light reflecting on it that it was ROUND! It looked like a big, silvery inner tube. I checked the other pictures out and all but one was too fuzzy to make out.As I went to crop one of the other pictures so you could get a better view of it, my hand slid wrong and enlarge the picture in a space above the UFO I was trying to crop. And I froze. My heart actually skipped a beat. In the sky above the bright UFO were 3 more dark objects. One was larger than the other and at an angle, with two smaller ones below it. I have cropped these with the bright UFO, and then separately so you can have an understanding of the perspective.The photos were taken in Cadillac, Michigan.((NUFORC Note:", "2 Triangle shaped objects hovering in pine Barrens on Lacey Road Forked river NJI was returning home from work driving lacey rd,a remote stretch of road in the pine barrens.It was approximately 11:15,11:20 pm on Saturday nite 09/15.I was chatting on my cell to a friend when I saw 2 very bright flying objects flying side by side,what seemed like very low (too low for most planes),just ahead and to the right of my car.I was traveling towards the rt 74 exit of the parkway, maybe 6 or 7 minutes away from there.At first i thought they must be some sort of police helicopter or EMT helicopter but as I got closer i realized they were triangle shape.They had 2 very bright Blue lights on the side and a red light on the back.Needless to say,I told my friend I would call her back.As I got closer ,I noticed they were very close together and then one changed and hovered above the other.They were moving very slowly,the lights were VERY bright on them.I had another driver on my tail so I slowed down and pulled to my right.When I looked up they had disapeared into cloud cover.We are close to Fort Dix so this has to be a weird Army thing right?.Maybe their testing something new?", "15-20 cigar-shaped ships with red and blue lights, numerous bright white lights apearing and dissapearing,I was outside smoking a cigarette at 10:20 p.m. on August 06, 2007 and was looking in the sky in the direction of our local airport.

It was dusk at the time, we drove up the woods creek road towards home.  As we drove along we saw a bright light ahead and as we neared it and saw what a strange thing we were looking at, Mom pulled our car to a stop, lowered the windows and shut the motor off. We gazed in amazement at what we saw, it was a football shaped craft with several lights from front to back. It was hovering over a dairy farm field, perhaps a hundred feet off the ground, I would guess it was about 30 feet in length. It made no sound at all, we had our windows down and our motor was shut off. After just a few minutes it started moving slowly up the valley (north). Mom started the car and we stayed along with it for about a mile, it then turned to the left (west), increased in speed and shot out of sight like a bullet.&quot; End of quote..

The object would  pick up speed, and then would start making very tight, perfect spirals  while traveling very fast. In the center of the spiral, this object  came to a complete stop again, turned 90 degrees, and then head east to  west at a slow speed, then disappeared.

It was too early for a star.  I took my food into the house and returned with a set of binoculars.  The craft had moved about 10-degrees in just a few minutes and was stationary (in a roughly 15-mph wind).  Viewing through the binoculars revealed a very bright silver sphere at roughly 2,000 feet. I did not have a hard time focusing on it as it was completely stationary (clouds were flowing by it at a good clip).  Anyway after about 5-minutes of viewing the craft seemed to go into a cloud. The odd thing was there seemed to be some sort of other strange shaped object in the cloud (though not at all well defined).  Both disappeared and no further sightings.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The sky was perfectly clear and the typical visable stars were crystal clear. As I was returning back to the house, I noticed a moving light in the upper left portion of the sky. As I observed closer, I realized the light was actually four distinct lights not one. Three of the lights were in a triangular pattern and one light was off directly off to the right. They were moving south-west across the sky. The altitude was very high. I intially thought the lights were a single satillite. I have seen numerous satillites over the years and these lights looked nothing like any satillite I have ever seen. The altitude seemed right but the speed seemed faster than a satillite. I realized that these lights were not multiple satillites travelling together or a commercial airlliner. The lights were bluish-white and did not blink. The lights stayed almost equal distances apart without any variations in formation. The lights were definetley seperate entities as i could see the night sky between them. They made no sound. I was able to observe the lights for approxiamatley 6 seconds before they faded from view. I couldn&apos;t see any high altitude clouds but figured that may possibly have been the reason I lost view of them. I was in trying to associate the lights to all my past experience with aircraft or satellites to make sense of what I saw. I have never seen anything like these lights before.

There were four individuals in the car at the time of the sighting and I interviewed each of them separately. They went on a late night drive to Border Field State Park (this park is located in the extreme SW corner of the continental United States, on the border with Mexico).  After a run-in with a Border Patrol officer they drove east on Monument Road, which turns into Dairy Mart Rd as the road turns to the north.  It was along that road that they noticed a building with a sign that read &ldquo;Area 50&rdquo; and another with a sign that read &ldquo;Area 51&rdquo;.  Some references to the real Area 51 were made as they continued north. When they reached Camino de la Plaza road they turned right, and began to head slightly southeast.  It was my coworker (a passenger in the car) who noticed lights to the northeast.  Later holding his hand out at arms length, he guessed that it would&rsquo;ve taken four fingers to block out the lights.  He thought that there were five yellowish white lights, but all the other eyewitnesses believed there to be only four white lights.  My coworker at first jokingly shouted to the others that there were the aliens.  The lights were positioned in the sky horizontally and parallel to the ground.  They were equidistance from one another.  The lights then moved in unison higher into the sky, keeping parallel with the ground. It was what the lights did next that surprised everyone and made them take what they were viewing more serious. From one end of this chain of lights, they pivoted like the hand of a clock and moved into a vertical position, now perpendicular to the ground.  The lights continued to go straight up.  They all got the impression that the lights began to twist once in this vertical position.  As it began to twist, the lights completely vanished.  My coworker was so amazed by this display that he called his aunt at 12:30 in the middle of the night to tell her what they just saw.  One eyewitness believes he could see the outline of a craft behind the lights. They also told me that the area near the border is a no fly zone, so this was indeed strange to see something like this.  My coworker said the lights were over a residential area and from looking at a map, he believes it was north of Route 5.  It was this vertical trajectory that defied any logical explanation for the eyewitnesses.  They are completely baffled by what they saw and plan to go back and see if they are able to see it again.  They did drive down Camino de la Plaza road to see if they could see it again, but they had no further sightings.", "BLURRED OVAL SHAPE LIGHT MOVING IN ANTI CLOCKWISE MOTION BEHIND THE CLOUDS FOR AN HOUR AND COUNTING AT 11PM PSTSince about 10:30 PST my husband and I are observing the following in Yucaipa.East of our home, an oval shaped light/blurred is moving in an anti clockwise large circular motion across the sky, making large circles&hellip;well actually more of an oval pattern.

During its rotation it seems to be fainter (less bright) on the lower/bottom part of its rotation. There is no beam extending to or from this light. The area of the sky it is happening is over what is typically more remote or desert and not an area where there are car dealers that usually have those very large advertising lights.

The lights stopped for a couple of minutes and then reappeared more extravagent. I personally witnessed the light appear over the ocean and then another orb seemed to stretch out of the original. The cloned orange orb moved faster than light to the far right and then in a quick spinning type motion the light stretched and lines appeared in it. Those went away and then suddenly 4 different ones appeared with the last one to remain being in the same spot as the one that had spun. That one two spun and they all vanished.

It was 75 degrees outside, clear, and no wind.  At the same time, we saw two objects pass together moving in a straight path from NNW to SSE. They were easy to see as they passed overhead. They were not points of light, but rather two round &apos;balls&apos; about 1/4 the apparent diameter of the moon, they were bright, but not as bright as the moon.  No lights were visible on these objects, yet they were bright and easy to see.  Anyone looking up at the sky at that time couldn&apos;t have missed this.  It was really spectacular.  They were visible until they faded from view as they approached the southern horizon. The two objects appeared to quickly move back and forth very close to each other every second or so in near synchrony during the two minutes it took for them to cross the sky. Two of us thought they may have been quickly circling each other as they passed over. It was very, very strange. It was impossible to determine their altitude or speed, but together they passed over us at about the same speed as a passing satellite.", "1 mother ship with her smaller onesOne main ship with 2 smaller one&apos;s.At that time their was an car accident in front of us.Maybe they were looking at it &amp; made an accident.Their traffic back up so a lot seen it.", "Unexplainable blinking lights witnessed over Texas sky.Looking up at the stars on a clear night, I noticed a blinking light and said, &quot;Look, a satellite.&quot; But then it was gone.

It looked almost as if it was blinking, but from one point in the sky to another. It was close enough to think it could have been one object, but then it disappeared.

They were at a pretty high altitude because I could see them well up and over the tree line. They were a good distance apart so I immediately thought they were a couple of planes either heading for Shreveport Regional Airport or Barksdale Air Force Base. I took my attention back to the road since it was at dusk dark and proceeded to drive on south towards my home and in the direction of the lights. I could no longer see them due to the trees along the road. When I got about a quarter mile from my house I came to a clearing in the trees that allowed a good view to the east and when I looked up at the darkening sky I saw the lights again. This time I saw they were not just lights. They were two objects, eliptical in shape, almost oval, and had three lights emitting from them. One of them was rotating on a center axis but neither was moving horizontal or vertical. I stopped to get a better look and I saw various planes flying around the objects with the familiar red and green lights but the lights on the objects were white, yellow, and red. My son became frightened at the excitement in my voice so I drove on home.  I ran in to get my wife to come out and look since I estimated the objects were at least 4 to 5 thousand feet up and would have been plainly visible from my home but when we ran back out they were gone. I looked every night after that for a long time in the same area where they were and never saw them again.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

He lived up in the country above my village in Sion Mills, Co. Tyrone so it was a really dark road with no street lights at all. We were walking along the road hand in hand talking and I was looking at the ground just to see where I was going when I saw what looked like two circles of light on the ground about a foot in front of us as if someone was standing over us pointing two torches at the ground. As soon as I saw this I squeezed my girl&rsquo;s hand in fear and we both looked up to see what looked like two suns flying over our heads at a good speed. They were only in view for about three seconds but I still remember them to this day as they flew over our heads and over the hill at the top of the lane. I cant remember if they made any sound although I don&rsquo;t think that they did and I&rsquo;m not sure how high in the sky they were as I don&rsquo;t know what size they were but they were about the size of two suns and that&rsquo;s  the only way I can describe them.

They stayed in one general area and I watched for a few minutes before going inside and locking the door!  The second event, last night (September 17th) at approximately 12am, I witnessed three red blinking lights flying very quickly across the sky.  They were separated several miles apart from one another and all three had very rapid red blinking lights.  It appeared that they would shoot to the East, hover for a moment, drop and move in another direction.

In any case, a friend and i were waiting to for some other friends, and decided to make the 5 or so mile drive from berkeley heights, to summit. For the first couple minutes, it was a normal uneventful drive. That would soon change. I was driving the car and noticed an enormous object fly overhead, at first i assumed it was a plane, but without any accompanying noise, i was forced to take a second look. At this point, i pointed up. My friend looked out the window and saw what i was pointing at. It was a craft, flying a few hundred feet up with 3 lights, and a triangular shape. The color of the lights was indiscriminate as it changed often. The object also appeared to be moving north east towards New york city. Just as we came to the realization of what we were looking at, the object seemed to disappear. (as if it knew we were observing)  At which point we noticed a new object (possibly the same object), starlike in appearance , which had appeared near where the other object seemed to disappear. We stayed fixed on it, as it was now moving easterly back towards us, from a position seemingly off the coast, but near the city. All of a sudden the object jumped literally from one end of the horizon to the other instantaneously (east to west). It hovered in this new position for about 2 minutes and then proceeded to jump straight up and disappear.. Needless to say my friend and I had no doubt as to what we had seen. Our only question was as to its origin. I&apos;ve always been interested in UFO phenomena and spent many a night as a child peering up hoping to catch a glimpse. Ive seen things that are suspect, but could easily be ruled out as being something entirely explainable by the right expert. This was entirely different however, there was no question that this was not any aircraft i had ever seen, or any easily explainable natural phenomena.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

It was about 11:30 pm.  I saw what looked like a shooting star in the sky, in front of us (it was in front, in the general direction toward which we were heading, slightly toward the right) and I immediately pointed it out to my 11 year old son who was in the back seat. However, (and this all happened pretty quickly, driving around 65mph) as I continued to look where the shooting star was I noticed there was a blue light with a red light next to it right where I had seen the shooting star.   I figured it was a plane.  I kept my eye on it, though, and it didn&rsquo;t move.  We got closer and closer, until we were both looking up at it, and eventually driving under it.  I slowed down a bit, to see if maybe it was moving, but it wasn&rsquo;t.  I didn&rsquo;t slow down for long, though, because once I realized this thing wasn&rsquo;t a plane I got out of there.  The lights were in a cigar shape, right next to each other, both sort of elongated, if that makes sense &ndash; I say this so as not to give the impression that they were two dots next to each other.  They were sort of like a bar, some blue to the left, red to the right.  I didn&rsquo;t get a good enough look to see if there was anything black behind them, or any other shapes.

She yelled downstair&apos;s to me to come and see what she had described to me as to what her and her sister had seen.  I ran outside with her only to see nothing.  She said it was right over our barn.  I was not skeptical of her because i do believe there is life out there, i just wished i could see for myself  a U.F.O.  So I stared at the sky for about 10 minutes, then all of a sudden a huge orange light followed by four more consecutive lights appeared due West of our farm.  When the fifth one came on they all shut off and as soon as they all shut off they started again only maybe two ship lengths ahead. (I am calculating ship length by the length of the five lights together).  At the end of the second array of lights I observed two individual lights (at what i will call the front and back of the craft).  I observed these lights for about half an hour.  In that time they turned color,(from red and back to a dull white to disappearing altogether. At one point it appeared to shoot out a wide angle light on it&apos;s southern pointed light).  At this point now i had started to notice several airplanes.  It is uncommon for me to see this kind of commercial traffic.  Two in particular were a pair of blinking lights coming out of the south.  One was following the other in a very close proximity.  There were no green or red lights, only a single blinking white light on what i think were two fighter planes flying in formation.  They were flying in a north westernly direction and soon turned due west.  I don&apos;t know if one turned his lights off but the one in the rear over took the one in front and it became only one light.  I watched that light fly right under the &quot;two lights&quot; that i thought were a craft and kept on going till it was out of sight.  I also observed several satellites which is also uncommon.  I am an intelligent person and am aware of! all mil itary and commercial aircraft.  I do not make rash decisions and I think before I speak.  I am not saying that this craft was from outerspace,  what i am saying is that if this craft was human made it would be as long as roughly 15 747&apos;s and equally as wide. This was unlike anything i have ever seen.  It was not a commercial airline or strange gasses in the sky,  these were five lights that came on and then went off and moved without sound.

For closer references on the base, the water tower and the swimming pool might still be there but I understand that all the buildings were torn down because they were constructed with asbestos board.I estimate that the object entered the ocean somewhere about 12 miles east of Asbury Park and 24 miles south of Long Beach, Long Island along the line I just described. According to my calculations it would have had to pass over the village of Churchville, MD. before reaching My Location.Considering the estimated metalic content of such objects I believe that a submarine or even a surface vessel with sonar should be able to locate this object by following the direction of that line starting at the point of observation longitude 76 deg.6&apos; and 15&quot; by Lat.39 deg.36&apos; and 15&quot; and proceeding 23 degrees E-NE toward Asbury Park. Or they could start at Asbury Park and proceed 23 degrees E-NE along long Island. Considering the apparent observed rate of decelleration not allowing for distance the object might have burried itself in the gravel bank just beyond the boundary of the Naval base.

Until my most recent sighting all were alone, all were yellow orbs, all made no sound and did not speed up or accelerate, but stayed on fixed paths at a steady pace. The only exceptions to this rule was a sighting in late June (date unknown) where a singular yellow circle/orb veered in an abrupt 90 degree turn and disappeared into a cloud bank. It never appeared on the other side. I hadn&apos;t planned to report any of them because I thought they were possibly some strange form of aircraft or satellites. However, the circle that made the 90 degree turn was in the sky with an airplane, and the two could not have been more different. The airplane was much slower, had blinking lights (none of the other crafts had blinking lights), and had multiple light colors (all other crafts have been yellow). Then my mother, my sister, and myself were on a walk July 25 between the hours of 9:30 PM (USA Central time) and 11:30 PM. We saw another orb in the sky, making no noise and moving at a fixed pace. However, the light was pulsing and yellow, and the craft itself was moving as though the air was thick, like a jellyfish through water. It was a triangular shape, though I thought it looked equilateral and my mother thought isosceles (we fought about it later). This craft made its rather slow way across the sky, heading West, making no noise whatsoever. Then it changed shape and became circular and fuzzy-quite hard to see. It appeared to have moved higher in the sky and farther away in a span of time that almost impossible to understand. The tempo of its blinking light also quickened-it seemed to double. The craft then began a lazy zigzag in the sky.  It did this for a short while and then vanished into the distance, still heading west. I should also mention that before it changed shape there was a flash in the sky, though my sister and my mother both thought that could have been a shooting star. (There were many in the sky that night, but I do know the difference between whatever that thing was and a star.)  These occurrences are made all the more unusual because I have never seen UFOs in the sky anywhere near my town, except for a childhood incident that remains fuzzy and was most likely a meteor (I do not remember that even well enough to report it).

I was resting on the ground after a big dinner, looking upward at the stars. I said to my wife, &quot;Hey look at that!! There is a UFO flying above us.&quot;She immediately looked up at where I was pointing. Our nephew jumps out of the backseat of the van and saw the same thing we were witnessing.It flew over us going slow like it was a gladder or something that goes that slow. It didn&rsquo;t have any flashing lights or make any sounds. It did have mirrors or something that reflected the lights of the city on the bottom of it. It went behind some tree and the sighting was over in about 20 seconds.We all agreed that we had seen the same thing.

Was stationay for 7 min and moved very fast and disappeared", "A brilliant orange-red light seen flying slowly in the sky above Rose City, MichiganFrom the backyard of my cottage in Rose City in Michigan, on the 17th of August, about half an hour before midnight, I spotted in the sky, which was cloudless, a brilliant orange-red sphere of light in motion to the west of Rose City.  When I first saw the object, which was larger than all the stars, it was about 40 degrees above the horizon.  Within a few seconds I could tell that it was moving eastward, toward the area where my cottage is.  It did not move in a straight line the entire time that it moved eastward; it strayed a little several times from the course that it was on.  It was completely silent, and the intensity of the light, which was radiant, never noticeably varied.  After a minute or two the object was almost directly above my land; and when it was nearly overhead, it did not look far away: it did not look as high in the sky as commercial planes do when at cruising speed.  It seemed to me to be at an altitude of about 15,000 feet.  It looked about five times larger than all the orbiting satellites that I have seen, and I have seen many satellites.   In fact, at no time did it look like it was in outer-space.  (The only planet visible that night at the time when I saw the object was in the southern part of the sky, and it was probably about 30 degrees above the horizon.  I do not know what planet it was, but I do know from the white color of it that it was not Mars.) When the object was between 40 and 30 degrees above the eastern horizon, it grew invisible in a matter of seconds.  That it was not a blimp is certain.  ...To get an idea of the size of this sphere of light that I saw, get out a Q-Tip and hold it so that only the top half of the head of one of the tips is visible above your thumb and index finger, and then go outside and fully extend your arm up toward the sky.  (By the head of the Q-Tip I mean not just the soft part extending beyond the stem but also the part of the stem that has cotton wrapped around it&mdash;the &ldquo;neck&rdquo;.)   The object looked just a little smaller! than th at. ...By the way, I do not drink alcohol and I do not use drugs of any kind, prescription or illegal.", "Object looked like a Concord (plane), size of a 50-passenger plane, no markings, no windows, but it was flying backwards.On August 9, 2007 at 19:55 I was sitting in my backyard.  I looked up and there was what looked to be a plane with wings similar to a Concord.  It seemed as though it was flying very low and was approximately the size of a 50-passenger plane.  It was light grey/off white in color.  I don&apos;t know how far this object was from me, but I think it was extremely low because from where I was I could see six brackets underneath (three on each side) attached from the body of the plane to the wings. They looked like L-brackets but were spanning out on the wings at about 45 degree angles.  There were no markings on it and I did not see any windows.  It seemed somewhat normal except for the fact that it was FLYING BACKWARDS.  It looked as if it was man made, it sounded like it was man made, but the fact that it was flying backwards totally threw me off.  Can someone explain what this might have been?((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that she is a public employee, and occupies a position of considerable responsibility.

All of the sudden, a white light appeared in the sky.  It was too high above the horizon to be &apos;on&apos; the ocean, so, it was in flight.  The light was either stationary, or headed directly towards us.  It suddenly moved to the south and disappeared.  There was no sound.  We thought it might have been a flare, but, it was a white light.  Also, a flare would have originated from the water and moved up then down, slowly.  About 1 minute later, we saw another white light, to the north of that general area, at the same altitude.  It appeared for about 2 or 3 seconds then disappeared.  We were shocked at what we had just seen and went in to get the video camera.  We are in our mid-30&apos;s and never seen anything like this, nor reported anything like this before.  We heard a news story on Fox about similar sightings there and thought maybe we should add our voices to the various reports. I know, in early 2000, there were reports from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution about a section of the continental shelf on the east coast showing signs of seperation off the NC/SC coast.  Could this have been sediment gas from that, that somehow ignited in the sky.", "Also a few months ago I had a very vivid dream in which I was on board a craft, and was able to see the road, ground, telephone poles, lines, trees and so forth from a window that was what I believe to be the control center of the craft. I was standing at a console along with an being which was a vistor from another planet. I asked him how did they manover the craft and he showed me a panel with square controls and I was allowed to turn the one he pointed out, to my surprise we made an abrute right angle turn but I felt no motion what so ever in the craft. I then asked what did they use for purpollision and he showed me a clear tank filled with some type of clear liquid which bubbled from the centre outward. There were two being standing on either side of this unit. The unit appeared to be maybe two feet in higth and one foot in diameter. It was sitting on some type of table, but I cound not see any support for the table top. It just sort of hovered there you might say. This is the last thing I remember about the dream. I just wanted to send this in and get your views. I truely believe we as a nation and the people of the world are being visited by extra tresstials from some far distant planet. But, I wonder what is their motive, what knowledge they must posess, what is their history, do they know if space is infinate, questions like this. Questions that one day will be answered because persons such as yourself are making a serious effort to explore these reports of sightings, contact, material evediance, and singals from far beyond. Perhaps one day the questions will be answered and then all the world population will know the truth. Thank you for alloweing me the time and space to report my experience to you. I look forward to your responce.PS: I am the person which reported the sighting at Florala, Alabama.Best Regards,", "cylindrical shaped object, due west in western NY sky, revolving green, red and white lights...I went outside for a cigarette at about 11:15 pm, I always star gaze and as I was observing the beautiful night sky (uncompromised by the city lights out here) I noticed one star was twinkling a bit more then the other&rsquo;s. As I watched it I realized that there was a ring of lights; green, red, and white that were swirling around it. I ran inside to grab my low grade binoculars which offered only a small increase in size to the object. I could see it wasn&rsquo;t saucer shaped but rather cylindrical or barrel shaped almost swelling in the center where the lights were. Normally this would have been the &ldquo;fools gold&rdquo; of UFO&rsquo;s eventually revealing itself to be a plane when it changed direction. This I stayed and watched for the better part of a half an hour. It did not move, or change its position in the sky. It stayed a consistent level on the horizon at about 35-34 degree&rsquo;s due west. This is definitely no plane, no star, no planet, and no satellite. Which is the normal checklist for any rational person to run down when distinguishing anything to be unidentified.((NUFORC Note:  Star??

I looked south east of the moon and thought I saw a shooting star.  It flew up over the hight of the moon around 9:45 pm with a white trail behind it, not unlike when a plane is very high and you see that white trail,  but it was much shorter.  I could only see flicking colored lights in the front of the trail.  It shot over the moon and was traveling north east more east towards the beach. It flew very high in the sky but you could see the colored lights then it disapeared.  I watched other planes in the area for the next 1/2 hour and the lights were different and the regular planes moved much slower then the thing I observed  The whole thing lasted less then 60 seconds.

I was wearing polarized sunglasses and this object was not visible to the naked eye. There were several jet aircraft in the sky at the same time, but this object was much higher up, I thought it might have been the international space station or something. I went and grabbed my binoculars and I was astounded to see a greenish glowing diamond shaped object, which had five orbs in a formation heading from the north to the southeast. For a second I thought it was a balloon or something, but this object was diamond shaped and had a glowing greenish hue, and had to be near sub orbital, and left no contrails to be a jet plane. I observed these objects for about ten to fifteen minutes, I showed my wife and her mom and a family friend and they were astounded. The five orbs seemed to be out in front of the greenish diamond object in a perfect formation pattern; their size was much more diminished compared to the greenish object. I didn&apos;t even notice them at first and spotted them after watching the Diamond shaped object. I must emphasize that these objects could not be seen with the naked eye, and if I did not have my sunglasses on, I would not have even seen the intial object. I searched the sky to make sure I was not in fact seeing stars, but no other objects similar to it could be seen in the crystal blue sky&rsquo;s background. After sometime of viewing them, about only fifteen minutes the objects I was observing simply vanished.  I live on the North side of Chicago and see Aircraft on approach to O&rsquo;Hare international every day, but these objects had to be 50&rsquo;000 feet or so, and the greenish Diamond object had to be quite large as it appeared to me to be a star.((FOLLOW-UP FROM SAME WITNESS))follow upI contacted the flight service station and for my report they told me the following  45 thousand feet winds were at 290@33 53 thousand feet winds were at 300@16  I saw the formation moving from the North to the Southeast.((END))", "Black triangle seen briefly in South-East of UKA friend and I were sitting out on deckchairs a little after midnight, looking up into the sky, hoping to see phenomena from the forecast meteor shower on the night of 12 August.We were in Chelmsford, Essex, which is in the South-East of the UK.Apparently out of nowhere, three large dots appeared in the sky. They looked large -- apparently at least ten times the size of stars *in terms of perception* -- although they weren&apos;t terribly bright. They formed the three points of an equilateral triangle, and they moved quickly -- over the space of about five seconds -- away over the horizon and out of sight.There was nothing visible between the dots, although background stars were blocked out, according to my friend. I myself was less aware of this observation at the time, so I&apos;m not sure whether I&apos;ve unfairly re-evaluated what I thought I saw.Today I have looked to the internet in an effort to see if such a sight is usual. I came across descriptions of BBDs, which appear to match what my friend and I saw. I should stress that I had never been aware of these before (unless, perhaps from films, of course).Thousands of Brits will have been looking up at the skies that night because of the meteor shower that received a huge amount of press attention in its run-up.

I noticed a large white rectangular object about 5 degrees higher than the highest buildings of downtown.  It looked like a large playing card.  At first I thought it might be a large banner being pulled behind a plane.  But the object was immense, at least 300 feet by 200 feet.  I looked for a tow plane but could see none.  Plus such a large object could not be towed behind a prop plane.  As I watched it slowly moved in an arc.  It seemed to be turning to the left from my perspective.  As it travelled in the arc, it seems to shrink in size, as if you were to take a playing card and slowly turn the flat edge perpendicular to youself.  As it reached the edge, it simply disappeared.

North (NYC north, not stratosphere north) of the 4 spheres were three of the exact same objects also in a perfectly straight line, so that all 7 objects were in a straight line moving at the same speed. The objects appeared for about 15 seconds in the sky, moving towards the shore, then they all disappeared at the same time.Less than a minute later we saw the same objects appear over the ocean again. These lights were in the sky, not in the ocean (i.e., not a ship).The lights appeared about 5 minutes after my daughter saw a &quot;meteor&quot; over the ocean. I saw the same &quot;meteor&quot; enter the atmosphere. It was not a meteor. It was unlike anything I have ever seen... shooting stars, planes, military or otherwise.  It was too big and too close. It was something that swooped down into our atmosphere. I didn&rsquo;t think much about it until I saw the perfectly round orange bright lights a couple of minutes later. These were not airplane lights...they didn&rsquo;t twinkle. They were simply bright orange illuminated orbs that moved toward the shore in a supersonic glide.Fishermen and beachcombers along the shore also saw the same incident. We asked them, because my husband and I were so incredulous about what we had seen. Everyone we talked to about the incident reported the same sighting...bright orange lights in a straight line, 4 and 3 in two groups.The night sky visibility was excellent...full moon and clear skies.Our background: My husband has five degrees: MBA, masters, PhD, and others.

As I watched the first one, and at the end of about two miniutes, it turned a dirty burnt orange hue, accelerated and then disappeared.  A few seconds later, the second object did the same thing.  Both objects left at the same point in the night sky. There was absolutely no mistaking these objects for any known aircraft.  There was no sound of any kind.  The objects were traveling from west to east at an unknown altitude.

When first noticed it seemed to have just  taken off from the ground and was gaining height rapidly. It levelled off at about 100 feet from the ground and seemed to be picking up speed. It banked suddenly away from us, then banked again to a straighter course, then gained more height and speed very rapidly. We&apos;re both experienced observers of aircraft and the forward speed and altitude gain far surpassed any light, small vehicle we&apos;ve ever seen or heard of. Within seconds the object was moving at well over 100 MPH (gauging by our own speed on the road). We observed it while it travelled away from us at great speed, then disappeared from view several miles to the north and at least a mile above us, gauging by its visual size. It was very hard to tell how large the object was and whether it was &quot;manned&quot; due to its speed. The closest description we can give is of some kind of very small ultralight flying machine that seemed to be constructed of just very thin metal bars. The shape was of a completely stripped down vertical metal piece with one cross piece. The ends of the cross piece seemed to have flanges, but it was hard to tell as it was banking, rising, and gaining speed very rapidly. It couldn&apos;t possibly have been a radio-controlled toy and there didn&apos;t seem to be anywhere for a person to be sitting.

I was outside around a fire with my Niece and Nephew. The sky was clear, weather nice. I looked to the sky and seen a triangular shaped UFO/Aircraft at about 2500-3000 feet up flying low speed. It&apos;s belly was lit up with approx 7 white lights (in a V shape) and it was virtually silent (it was very silent). It&apos;s direction was north I believe, following the Niagara River towards Niagara Falls (30 Km away). Our sighting was with 3 people and I would say it was 2-3 minutes duration as it disappeared into the night and tree line. This is the 3rd time in 1 month I have seen it. I visit my friend regularily who lives in Ft Erie, he has seen it with me a few weeks back. It was an awsome sight to see and next time I WILL have my camera on hand to video it. It is as if I can set my watch to this &apos;thing&apos;. I also know it can be seen from Buffalo, but do believe it was in Canadian airspace the three times I seen it. My take on this mystery Aircraft/UFO is this. I believe it to be a B2 Spirit Bomber patroling the border, I may be wrong though. I am a true believer in UFO&apos;s and an Aircraft buff, but to the untrained eye... this is one very freaky sight and confuse/scare someone by it&apos;s appearance. It is ghostly in nature and it blends into the night sky perfectly. Added all that with it&apos;s silence and I am sure it is a B2 Stealth. Anyone reading this who is in either Buffalo NY or Fort Erie Ontario areas, I urge to set out with your video camera at about 10 at night to be sure you catch it. Keep a watch west into Lake Erie. The wait is worth your time. I only assume this Aircraft is flying easterly over Lake Erie then onto Lake Ontario. Our area here is big time internation border with numerous bridges crossing into the USA and I am certain it is a secret border patrol tool. Very intimidating!

So, I am watching these two very bright stars that have never been there before for about 2 or 3 minutes when suddenly they start moving! They go north a bit. Then they stop. The one on the left stays put and the one on the right takes off! It goes North a bit more and then stops, winks out.. I&apos;m thinking I&apos;d lost track of it at this point. But no... it lights up with this brilliant white light, fades out for 4 or 5 seconds, travels and then positively pulsates with brilliant white light... goes out for 4 or 5 seconds, lights up again. It eventually gets too far north for me to see and I lose track of that one after about 2 more bright pulsations. The one on the left is still hovering, after another 30 seconds or so it fades a little like it gained altitude, starts to move, and then... zip.. shoots off after the other one. Neither object made any noise. As bright as they were I would have expected to hear something if it were any kind of conventional aircraft. I am still trying to comprehend what it could have been. I was so awestruck. I am an ex military wife and have done some government work. My husband is disabled and I am returning to college concentrating on the health information technology profession.

One was white, the other blueish. At first I thought it was just an airplane and then the white light seemed to shine a spotlight up into the sky (at the moon). It was during a lunar eclipse. I pulled over to the side of the road and proceeded to watch it for a while. The aircraft appeared triangular, but I am basing this on the positioning of the lights. The aircraft would continue to do the same pattern over and over. It is somewhat hard to explain, but the two lights would seem to disappear and three lights (much like headlights of a car) would come on. The aircraft would come towards the edge of the freeway, and spotlight the moon, flip over upside down, and then turn away. It would then turn around, turn on the three bright lights as it came back towards the freeway. It would again spotlight the moon, flip upside down ( which would now be right side up) again and head away. It made very little noise but I could faintly hear it. It was in the vicinity of a small airport and may have just been a small airplane, but I have never seen an airplane stay upside down for as long as this one was. I also haven&apos;t seen an airplane with lights such as this, which gave it a triangular appearance.

PD))", "moving lights, and faded objects, explosions.This is my second post on here, but today there were more witnesses and this time we even got the footage on camera!  After the sighting lastnight we decided to do some research to see if there have been anymore sightings in our area. Well what we found was a surprise. It came out to be over 50 sightings in our same area since 1985. First sighted in 1940. All the records reported back then describes exactly what we saw the past two nights. Walking down from the same house, we looked in between the two houses where the first sighting was. This light stayed for quite a few minutes, then it slowly began to move left. While it was moving it dropped out another light.. like fire. Then the light that was dropped faded. The orignial light continues to flow left and then it slowly fades away itself.Due ot the fading away we believed it was a flare. Expecailly since we live next to the military base (fort hood). Thinking it was training of the soldiers we called the MP&apos;s and they told us that there was no trainging happening at that time.Making us more curious we stayed outside to watch for the lights. Eventually we saw the sky light up red. After afew flashes of red came the original objects appeard in the original spot.Only this time around it was 4 in one place at one time. Each time one light would fade another object would appear... but yet in the exact same location as the others.Each time one would fade, another one would drop out fire.Not knowing what this was we dug out the binoculars. To our surprise it came out that the objects were NOT flares and yet the stuff that was being dropped was fire.After awhile the objects themselves exploded. We decided to chase after the lights to get our answer on what it was. As we got closer and closer we noticed that the fire would just drop behind the hills.We got to the point where we were too close, and being alone at night in one car we decided to go home. When we got home we looked up videos online of UFO&apos;s and came upon videos of exactly what we have recorded... Now you tell me what it is?  Yet when the police here says its flares. We want an answer. And yet until we find it we will sit out everynight and get this on camera.", "Brief sighting of a group of black triangles that suddenly disappeared.Appearance / Description of Object(s):  Black triangular objects with no markings, lights, reflections or familiar aircraft features (stabilizers, etc.). Size of Object(s):  At arms length, the objects appeared to be less than 2 inches across. The actual size appeared close to that of a private or fighter jet. The objects appeared to be equilateral triangles with less than 100 feet per side. Distance to Object(s) &amp; Altitude :  Directly overhead. My guess would be around 7500 feet in altitude. Description of Area / Surroundings :  West Los Angeles (urban) just west of the intersection of Pico &amp; Sawtelle Blvds close to Santa Monica airport. Full Description &amp; Details :  In the summer of 2000, I was driving with my then girlfriend late one afternoon before sunset westbound on Pico Blvd. just west of Sawtelle Blvd.. While stopped at a traffic light, she pointed to something she saw in the sky which was almost directly over us. I had to lean forward to be able to see up through the windshield to observe 3 identical black triangular objects. I observed them for less than 30 seconds. The objects were motionless and we could not hear any noise from the objects. There were no markings, lights, reflections or familiar aircraft features (stabilizers, etc.), just a solid black object. The objects were in a loose triangle formation separated from each other by a distance of approximately 5 times their individual width. What struck me most was their stillness and almost silhouette-like appearance. My impression is that the objects were the size of private jets or fighter planes. They were significantly higher in altitude that the normal Santa Monica airport traffic that occurs regularly in that area, enough so that a closed fist at arms length could have covered two of the objects (were they spaced tip to tip). While observing them, I moved my head to change my viewing angle so as to verify that this was not caused by debris on the windshield or reflections. These were definitely airborne objects. Once the traffic light changed to green, I resumed driving, but was unable to see the objects again since they were nearly directly overhead. Once we had driven a few blocks so that the objects should have been easier to view from a shallower angle, the sky was empty where they had been. Given the shape of the craft, their hovering behavior and sudden apparent disappearance, I assume that these were solid objects under some sort of control, though not any type that I am familiar with nor aware of. Witness Background:  At the time, I was working in the entertainment industry as an artist for an internet animation studio. I have a bachelor&apos;s degree in Fine Art and am currently self-employed as an illustrator. Views on UFOs, before and after sighting:  I have a strong interest in UFOs, both before and after my sighting. I have read several books on the subject and seen several documentaries, as well as listened to the Coast to Coast, the Paracast and other paranormal-related radio programs. I have found that this interest and the knowledge I have acquired has made me more of a skeptical observer than I was before since I am more aware of the conventional sighting explanations.

She was on the phone sitting in a recliner and glanced out our bedroom window and noticed an object hovering over the next door neighbors house.  She said it was shaped like a triangle.  It had 3 lights on the bottom, 1 red light in the middle and 2 white lights, 1 on each end.  There were 2 more white lights located half way up, 1 on each side of the triangle.  She did not see the top of the craft because the top of our bedroom window blocked the rest of the craft, so there could have been a light at the top. The craft was fairly stationary over the roof.  It did move in an up and down pattern and did this for 3 to 4 minutes.  It slowing started moving east and went behind some trees and disappeared.  She said it could have been as big as a car or bigger.  She could not tell what the color was but seemed to have a reflective finish.  Sunset was around 6:52 pm and she guesses this was around 7:15 pm so it was already est. 70% dark.  It wasn&rsquo;t too dark as she could see the sky behind the craft.

At 8:12pm, I saw what appeared, to me, to be something akin to an irridium flare or bright plane landing light dim and go out about 12 o&apos;clock high.  One minute later at 8:13pm, to the west, I picked up an orange light approaching at 2-3x the speed of the incoming airliners (on flight path to PHL from West to East). Initially just orange, the light pattern of the object became a clockwise rotating orange beam, similar to a &quot;bow tie&quot; rotating clockwise.  I payed close attention - no blinking lights and it roated about 40-50 RPM (one clockwise rotation per second or so).  Initial thought was it looked like a recent viewing of a flyover of the ISS.  However, it got interesting at this point.  After viewing the craft for 5 seconds, it stopped.  Stopped! This is where my heart started to beat quickly.  I did not take my eyes off of it and in a very short time, it reversed direction from due-east to what appeared to be almost a 180* direction change and it appeared to start heading up.  It changed direction again 2-3 more times, going east again, then another zig back to north west where it dimmed and disappeared.  The point it disappeared was not too far from the point in the sky I had seen the flare-type effect at 8:12pm.  It had done this activity at about the same time I caught, out of the corner of my right eye, the bright headlight of a commercial airliner traveling from East to West on an opposite path toward the object (a normal flight path from PHL outbound to the West).  The object appeared to have &quot;sensed&quot; the airliner heading its way and it made a choice to zig zag away and then out of sight &quot;upward&quot; in a course correction effect. The object didn&apos;t seem too out of the ordinary as a rotating orange bar of light.  What was astounding was that it stopped and changed course a number of times in a matter of seconds. The size of bar of orange light would have been 2-3 times the width of a commercial airliner at 25K feet.  Possibly just under the width of my pinky fingernail held at arm&apos;s length.  I do not know if I can judge the height of the object but would approximate 15-20K feet.

They were shaped in a triangular shape and very shiny, and could move from one area in the sky to another area in the sky in less than a second.

The light being emitted was brighter than anything I have ever seen- somewhat like a flashbulb that was on continually.  After a few seconds, the color shifted to a dark charcoal black with a halo ring around the perimeter.  The black was unlike anything I can describe.  Much darker than black itself&hellip;. Very unusual.The object moved slowly from West to East in the sky and kept switching from black to very bright.  I noticed a group of three men standing nearby and asked them what they thought it could be.  One replied &quot;that&rsquo;s a balloon,&quot; and they went on talking and ignoring the object.  The orb began to move up into the heavens and get smaller.  By the time my ride arrived, I could still see it at a great distance but I could only see when it was bright, not black.  This was no balloon, not a military aircraft that I could identify (McCord AFB is nearby).  It certainly was not a helicopter or plane.  It is very difficult to describe the intensity and nature of the bright glow and the charcoal black.

The sun was setting so it was not completely light out at the time. Two people, whom I didn&apos;t see, were walking out had stopped and pointed towards the sky looking at something and then left ( as I was later told). As I was almost in the door i heard  another person say something like &quot; look at that glider up there.&quot; So I walked back out in front of the store and tried to see the glider. Two other people now were looking at the &quot;glider.&quot; The object was located east of where I was standing and was high enough to be visible from the light of the setting sun. At first it was hard to find but when I did I immediately didn&apos;t think that it was a glider, and by glider i mean hang glider. A glider would probably not be flying that high near a major city (Nashville air traffic flies right over the area) or when it was getting dark.It was high up in the air, somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000 feet possibly, and was very dark colored, most likely black. It was triangular in shape. There were no lights on it to indicate it was an airplane or otherwise. It appeared to be moving very slowly north, northeast as best as I could tell.One of the witnesses towards the end said &quot;look theres two.&quot; The object or possibly objects either moved away or it was just too dark to see them after a couple of minutes.Personally I am aware of Black Triangles and their observances near cities and interstates.

At about 1am I went up to the darkened school yard alone to see if maybe I could catch a few early annual Perseid meteors shooting across from the North sky. I was disappointed to notice the installation of new security lights in my favorite urban astronomy field, which actually do nothing but cause light pollution and burn energy... so I decided to lay in the middle of some playground equipment where the shadows would cover me and give me a much darker if slightly more limited view of the sky. I was laying with my head to the west and feet to the east so the meteors would appear to my left and fly to the right. It was a slow show, but a pretty clear night. I could barely make out the faint glow of the Milky Way. I saw about 5 bright Perseids over the course of approximately 45 minutes, when something enormous and low appeared directly in front and above me to the East-southeast. When I say enormous I mean it seemed like a large house with 2 car attached garage was flying over my head. As soon as my eyes flicked to it, It was directly over me. Although it was dark with no Moon, the craft was darker, like it absorbed light. Its hard to explain the shape. Like 5 or 6 or 7 black square boxes connected oddly, sort of like a 3 box rectangle with 2 other box protrusions on either side 1 front and 1 back, with a large orange circle in the center of each square 2/3rds the square size. The orange glow did not seem to be lights, but more like very hot orange glowing metal. There were no running lights what so ever. I got the impression it was much larger than I could actually see, and was not supposed to be able to see it, but the orange heat glow lit up just a small portion of the bottom of the craft which is all I really saw. Although the square and circles were symmetrical, the boxes seemed to be put together in an odd shape. I came home and drew it and painted it but I cant get it to look exactly like what I saw but you can at least get an idea. This craft did not seem aerodynamic in any way, yet it was flying super fast, Lear jet fast, although flying is the wrong word. More like it moved like a waterbug across the surface of water, or dragonfly like... kinda skiddering diagonally sideways.. It passed directly over me and shot off West Northwest. As it passed I flipped over on my stomach and elbows to get a better view and t disappeared over some trees that fast. The whole event lasted less than 30 seconds. Not a single sound came from it. The crickets kept on chirping. There was no wind. It was very calm. An odd thing seemed that maybe it was moving slowly or standing still until my eyes flicked to it, and it shot off straight over me. I do not know if it was watching me or was it just moving over when it saw me an decided to take off? I was kinda hidden by some steel playground equipment.. I have seen strange things in the sky before, but nothing even remotely close to this.I know what satellites look like. I know what the ISS space station looks like. I know what comets and asteroids and meteors look like. I own a 6&quot; Newtonian reflector telescope. I have been to military air shows before. I know what planes and helicopters and blimps are capable of. Although I have never seen swamp gas ignite I am pretty sure this was not that either!  I saw what I saw. As to who was driving that remains to be seen!  I have another sighting posted on here where I saw 3 black V triangles in the same schoolyard, which happened 11 years ago. I would like to add that looking back I think the sightings are connected, and from pictures I have seen I think they are the same type of craft that was over Phoenix Arizona in 1996 the same year, but in my case they were much much higher and therefore smaller. And there were 3 of them. Just my speculation but it seems to me as if these lights/boxes can move together like an F-16 wings retract and expand for higher speeds, but not for the same reasons. They move from V to more wide mouthed U and boomerang shapes, and now I think they can form any shape, maybe even come apart and move freely and then rejoin at different angles. Keep looking up!", "Strange faint blue lights in Selfridge Airbase areaWhile sitting on my front porch with my dog smoking a cigarette, I was looking up at the stars.I noticed that what looked like a star seemed to be moving. It was a faint blue circular light that seemed very high in altitude. It moved in a straight line, however it would come almost to a complete stop, then take off again with a huge burst of speed.At the end, it came to a sudden stop, then with a bright flash it took off again, but this time it left almost a nike-swoop shaped trail and seemed to speed off straight up. a few seconds later, the dot of light faded out.Since then, I have noticed similar objects on 2 separate occasions, however the objects maintained a constant speed and moved in straight lines. The first object moved from NNW to SSE. the second moved from the East to the West, and the third moved from North to South", "8 flying objects sighted in SwitzerlandDear Sir or Madame  I am a Swiss student and I&apos;m writing to you in hope of some answers. At approximately 12 o&apos;clock in the night from Saturday, the 15th September to Sunday, the 16th September my friend and I saw 7 or 8 dull glowing objects in the sky above 9470 Buchs, Switzerland ( 47&deg; 10&apos; 0&quot; N, 9&deg; 27&apos; 59.99&quot; E) .  They were flying a perfect V-formation for about a second and changed to a straight line, while the outer two objects were swerving from left to right (almost touching the next objects in the row) at a remarkable speed, without the merest break at each turning point. Following characteristics of the objects exclude the possibility of them being normal aircrafts, balloons or animals:  -          The speed of them (about the speed of a military jet flying one kilometre above us), the covered roughly 100&deg; of sky in about four seconds. Because there were now clouds what so ever and we could merely see the dull glowing lights of the objects it was impossible to tell the height. - They emitted no sound at all, despite flying directly over us  -          The way the outer two objects were swerving  -          There was no wind that night  -          The fact that they glowed  -          The size of them (about three millimetres in diameter)  -          The light always stayed the same: it neither blinked nor changed in brightness (not as bright as that of a passenger aircraft), each object had one light  Neither the Swiss army nor the Swiss Aviation Control is aware of anything, nor could anyone else give us an explanation of what we saw that night. Can you tell us what kind of crafts we saw?  Thank you for giving us a serious answer!

The &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; I saw was the color of a light bulb and larger than a star or any airplane lights. Originally, I thought it was a reflection in the window, but as I got a closer look from several angles, including outside, it was definitely in the sky. It stayed in relatively the same spot for at least 45 minutes (possibly more, I fell asleep), with slow and subtle movements upwards and side to side. It did not change color, no moving lights, and no beams &ndash; just a white glowing orb. It was definitely not an airplane tower, but who&rsquo;s to say it wasn&rsquo;t a weather balloon or a new lab experiment.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was massive, at least 150&apos; wide. As it flew right over my head i was unable to define it, as if it were &apos;cloaked&apos; in some way, and was a moving mass of &apos;darkness&apos; against the clear night sky. It was definitley a triangular shape. The engine was like nothing i have ever heard before, like the sound of giant blowers or fans. It had a flashing red beacon in the front and two very bright clear lights, one on each side., however they did not illuminate the ground at all.

We were traveling through some rolling hills when all of a sudden a bright flash in the sky caught my eye.  I focused my attention to the area and then I was able to see many objects in the sky. The objects seemed to be of diamond shape, but completely flat, so just imagine a 2-d diamond.  It was metallic in color as it reflected the sunlight extremely well when the horizontal plane was perpindicular to the ground. I immeadeately told my friend about what I was obeseving and told him to focus his attention towards that airspace, but he was not able to observe them. I remembered that I had been wearing my polarized sunglasses so I took them off so he could have a look, and lo and behold he could see them too. This was the case for a minute or two but when we grew closer we were able to observe them with the naked eye. The objects movement was so calculated, it was most reminiscent to a group of sardines swimming in the ocean, in that they all were oreinted in the same direction and turning and interacting with one another with crazy precision. It was funny because my friend and I had been keeping ourselves entertained by sharing mostly everything that we have heard/seen about ufo&apos;s from coast2coast and various other surces and BAM! who would have known that we would be able to observe something so awesome as what we saw.", "Two oblong objects flying in formation near Orlando International AirportI was driving home from the office about 10:45am on 09/14/07. I was on SR-417 when I happened to glace out and up out of the drivers side window. I saw two objects flying in formation, one slightly behind and to the left of the lead craft.It was clear with scattered cumulous clouds. What struck me most was the brightness of the craft, brighter and whiter than the clouds they flew in front of.At first I thought it was two jetliners, but I know that commercial liners do not fly in formation and also because there were no visible vertical stabilizers on these two craft. Plus their shape appeared to be like a 2x4 board.They were flying north to south, but could not estimate the altitude, although they seemed quit big and close.About this time there was a Southwest Airliner heading north out of Orlando International Airport. The objects were bigger than the commercial jet. They seemed to pass over the airliner, but I can&apos;t say if they were actually over the plane, it just looked like it from my perspective.As the airliner passed, the trailing object did a 90 degree turn to the right although I couldn&apos;t actually see it turn, it just went from going south to going west without any sign of deceleration, but it did seem to pick up speed and move rapidly away.By the time I got my vehicle pulled over to the side of the road the objects were gone.", "Fast moving oval object very bright orange hovered then flew offI saw a bright orange oval flying in a straight line coming from the West and heading East, I thought it was a satelite until it stopped moving.

I saw a green and a red light hovering above the highway.  They did not move at all.  I first saw them from probably 0.5 miles away.  It caught me as being very strange that there would be some craft hovering above the highway.  There was no white light or spotlight - just the green and red lights.  As I approached it, I turned off my radio and opened my window - wondering if it was a helicopter.  However I did not hear any noise other than the usual highway traffic noise.  I would estimate it was about 150 - 200 feet above the highway.  As I passed under it, I could not make out any detail other than the lights.

From our vantage point it appeared to be above the Siegen Lane area however it was most likely over the Gulf. The mass was over the size of several airplanes in my opinion. While we were observing, it broke into 4 separate pieces that appeared to be the size of an airplane. Now to put some size reference on what I mean by &quot;the size of an airplane&quot;, when you look up into the sky and see a jet flying overhead at the highest point you have seen one, then you understand what I mean by &quot;the size of an airplane&quot;. Unfortunately we did not think to whip out our cell phones and take a picture, we were in awe of what we were seeing. I have yet to see anything on this in the news. We did not see any other streaks across the sky that may have given us the thought that it was just a meteor shower.", "UFO sited at Minnehaha Creek in Minneapokis MinnesotaWe were watching the stars at Minnehaha Creek.

I then looked up at the sky, I was facing east. I saw traveling from North to South what seemed to be 2 pretty big pinkish red round &quot; lights&quot;  traveling. One was in front and the second one seemed to be following the first one. The second object was behind and to the right of the lead object. The were too low to be airplanes and made no sound at all. I clearly saw the two objects long enough to see that they were not everyday craft. They seemed to be exactly the same size and seemed to travel at the exact same speed. They flew into or behind a cloud and I lost sight of them. I continued to look to see if I could find where they went but to no avail. About 2 minutes after I saw these pinkish red &quot;lights&quot; that seemed to come from the north, I heard and saw an airplane fly in the same direction but the airplane turned to the east too soon to follow the path that these objects had taken.

It was a hazy sky last night with large grey clouds moving to the north.  The first time we saw the light, it was a bright light moving at a high rate of speed high in the sky over Canyon Lake.  It was moving north to southwest.  There was a large grey cloud in front of it, so at first we thought it was a shooting star.After the cloud moved, we saw the light would move from North to Southwest, back to North and then it would move from North to Northeast stopping at certain points, then go back to the Southwest.  It was a cycle that never stopped.We then thought that it might have been a strobe of light from the ground like the large lights they put in a parking lot to attract attention, but we never saw any strobe of light from the ground up.  This light pattern was high up in the sky and it would change it&rsquo;s interval&rsquo;s of speed, but never changing the pattern that it took.We have a telescope, but due to the rate of speed and the distance that it would travel, we could not capture it.  We did not have a camera or a video to take any picture of this.We decided to go to bed, but opened our curtains to watch from our bed.

All of a sudden we heard a really, really faint breeze sound. I don&rsquo;t know how we both heard it since it was so faint.    We both looked up and saw a traingle shape object moving northwest. It wasn&rsquo;t very high in the air. I would say maybe a 1-1/2 neighborhood block up in the air. I couldn&rsquo;t begin to tell you how big it was. It was made up of small faint lights. I don&rsquo;t remember seeing the third part of the triangle. Just the &ldquo;V&rdquo; shape. It was made up of maybe 7 or 8 lights on each side.  We pretty much ran inside and told his parents what we saw and then came out later and did not see it again.  About 7 years later I was living in dallas and saw a show that Larry king was doing in area 52 with a bunch of UFO experts. He was broadcasting from the desert. I was really freaked out to see that one of the sightings that they were showing was an exact description of what I saw.

As I was setting up my tripod in my solarium which faces southeast over Lake Ontario in Etobicoke, I looked up at the moon which was very &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; and noticed something &ldquo;black&rdquo; on the face of the moon. I asked my husband if he could see it from the livingroom where he was sitting and he said yes he could. I reached for his camera which was closest to me and had a 100-400mm lens on it to get a good look. I was amazed at what I saw! At the top of the moon but closer to the right side rather than the middle, there appeared to be a black pitchfork shaped object shooting downward toward the bottom of the moon leaving two stream vapour barrier in its trail. I was able to get about 5 shots in before the object reached the bottom of the moon and once leaving the light background of the moon it appears to be nothing more than a puff of black smoke. Upon reviewing the images I shot I realized that in one of the early shots I took of the moon the &ldquo;pitchfork shape&rdquo; was at the very edge of the moon prior to me being aware that it was there. At first I thought maybe this image was of a satellight that was set to record the eclipse but I have spoken to a few amature starwatchers and they agree that they have never seen anything like this.

We found ourselves looking at a cluster of stars that none of us could figure out which one it was and after several minutes the brightest stars in that group sailed across the sky in a fast straight line, stopped momentarily and then shot upwards and was gone.

After watching for a while, I noticed that the red light would only stay on for about 3-5 seconds or so and they would all be at about the same altitude.  They would appear 1 to 3 at a time and the interval of occurrence would be every 2-4 minutes. The lights started to appear somewhat more to west and closer in our direction.  This went on for about 20 minutes and then I noticed a horizontal line of lights appearing to the southwest of our location.  They started appearing at about 1-2 second intervals going from left to right.

I was staying at my aunt and uncle&rsquo;s home for a few months.  I don&rsquo;t remember the exact address, but know it was near West Point Academy.One night I went to see a movie with a friend.  The night was very clear, but extremely cold.  On our way back to the house (between 11:30-2:00 AM) we noticed a star-like round shaped object in the sky with a long red glow under.  We thought it was a star because the thing was not moving and was far away. After a few minutes, we realized that we were approaching the object, and that it was actually in our atmosphere, stationed in mid air.  The closer we were getting to the area, the less we could see the red glow, but the object remained lit (white light), and in the same place throughout the entire time.My friend became very agitated and began to drive very fast as we got closer.  I don&rsquo;t know how big this thing was, or how many feet high it was from the ground, but I do recall that the size was as big as a quarter (coin) from where we were.  It was a disk-shaped craft, but not flat. The top was round and all the bright white light was coming from there.  I rolled down the window and exposed my head out of the window to look up. The only sound we heard came from my friend&rsquo;s car engine, and not from the craft. I saw the round shape of the machine, and inside the circle it had a frame-like in the shape of an octagon.  I don&rsquo;t remember if the octagon was protruded, but do remember very well that inside the octagon were several tiny lights (yellow and some red) blinking very slowly.  I remember shouting at my friend to stop the car, and to please look at the craft, but he began to yell at me to get back in the car. He was driving very fast, and I pulled myself back inside the car only because my face was hurting from the cold air.  I was screaming from excitement and nerves, and could not believe that we saw the most incredible flying machine.  It was right up there, stationed in mid air, and we were so lucky to have had the opportunity to see something like that.  I remember being so mad at Michael for rushing away, but after few years realized that even though he was thirty years old at the time, he was dead scared and wanted to get away as fast as he could. I don&rsquo;t know if that UFO was man-made or extraterrestrial, but I have never seen anything like it in my whole life.  The duration of the entire sighting was about ten minutes, and the only reason why we lost sight of the craft was because we drove away.  The UFO never moved.  I must say that aside from seeing the craft, we didn&rsquo;t experience any other anomalies such as: electronic problems with the car; lost of time, etc&hellip; The next day I told my family what happened the night before, but my friend refused to talk about the subject.  I wanted to tell everyone about my experience, but decided not to do it since my family discouraged me from saying anything; stating that since I was nineteen years old I would probably be treated like a crazy person, or a charlatan trying to get attention.  I limited myself to discuss the subject only with my family and two other closed friends.  I have never again seen another UFO, and to tell you the truth I don&rsquo;t need to because what I saw was as real as the computer I have in front of me right now.Besides the fact that I am older and more comfortable talking about UFOs, the reason why I am reporting this sighting for the first time in twenty-seven years is that I really would like to find out if other people in Upstate NY, or any other place, have reported stationary UFO sightings with similar descriptions of the craft.  I have visited several websites on the subject, but haven&rsquo;t contacted anyone until now.   Another reason I have to share my experience with you is that I am overwhelmed by the amount of information disclosed from many reputable and honest people throughout the years.  It is definitely a fact that the media has been used, by those in power, as a tool for social control.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I&apos;m in to health food products, and a co-worker told me that there was one near my place of employment. She said that she believed it was a small store.  At 5:00 P.M., I left my job and started looking for the store. I figured that it would be nice to be able to purchase items like vitamins, etc. on my lunch hour. By the time you get off from work and travel to these little stores, they&apos;re closed.  I walked down the street slowly, looking on both sides of the avenue, trying to find the store.  Eventually, I came upon a small store that I figured had a good chance of being it.  The building above it was abrownstone that was boarded up.  I steped down the one or two steps and opened the door to the shop.  Almost as soon as I walked in, I had a feeling that this wasn&apos;t the best place.  There was a man there.  He was my height 5&quot;6&quot;, skinny, dark, but otherwise normal.  I have a very clear, loud voice, and because of my previous vocal instructions over time, somewhat loud.  I asked the man, whether he had whatever the herbal remedy was that I wanted.  He became very angry and said in a voice that was almost as loud as mine&quot;you got some nerve coming in here with all that attitude.&quot;  I immediately answered him with &quot;what the hell are you talking about atitude.  Without saying another word, He aimed his finger at my heart and something that I coiuldn&apos;t see hit me in the heart.  I have ben know for having a lot ot courage so me being me, I just stood there and stirred at him. Then he said, &quot;I could have just killed you.&quot; I then realized that I was in more danger than I realized. I also knew what I had accidentally come upon.  There was a conversation that followed where I sought of asked where he was from, but he only said that it was a long way from here.There was great emphysis on long. Every time he moved around the store, you never saw him move to another location, he just appeared at that spot. Some how, I was asleep and while still standing, I felt my feet being kind of numb.  I had been standing in that same spot for a couple of hours. When I finally got up the nerve to say that I was leaving, he said&quot; we are leaving tomorrow to. That would have been Wednesday. I walked to the door, and as I looked around he said, &quot;when you get home tonight I want you to say xxxxxxx.  I didn&apos;t say it then and I won&apos;t say it now.  As far as I am concerned, that could have been some password the he could have used to take me aboard his space ship.  As I placed my hans on the door, his face blurred and changed to what he really looked like.  He was still my height, very dark, but his eyes were large but that skin around the eyes reminded me of a crocodile.  Ther was a thin yellow line running from one corner of the eye to the other. And he laughed out loud. He surely wasn&apos;t pretty. I really wanted to ask more questions, but thought better of it.  On Thursday, the day after he said they were leaving, I walked down to that store, near the curb.  I wanted to see if there was anybody there.  Would you believe, the place looked as though no one had ever been there.   It was empty. I rode past on the bus ther other day, and the place had been undergoing renovations.It&apos;s now a nice looking brownstone with a store.  I&apos;d like to know who rented it before.  The things that I saw him do, couldn&apos;t have been done by anyone other than an alien.  I&apos;m now actually glad that I had the experience.  It told me what I suspected all along, that we are living with these people and cannot tell the difference. When I saw how he just changed his appearance within one or two seconds, I was surprized, to say the least. This really happened in 1989.  I was sought of afraid to mention it because I didn&apos;t know whether or not I should.

This happened within a few seconds and a few more seconds later it happened again a bit farther down the road.  We drove to try to get a better look but we could find them.  There wasn&rsquo;t a jet stream or anything.  We thought it was some sort of military aircraft but after doing some research online I decided that if it was a military aircraft then it is top secret and not publically acknowledged.

This is the first such encounter with UFOs and am quite interested to get any information regarding UFOs or UFO sightings.", "Bright red oval shaped object with blurred edges rapidly crossed the night sky from east to west.A strange red oval shape which was somewhat blurry around the edges, travelled in a straight trajectory from east to west at 2315hrs.  The object moved very quickly in the direct opposite direction of the 5 or 7 satelites we had previously observed that night.  The object completely crossed the sky in about 8-9 seconds leaving no visible trail behind it.", "My friends and I were standing in a street when we noticed a bright blueish/white light 20 ft in the air that caused a power outage.The three of us were stanging in the middle of 60th street.  A road that cuts our small town in half.  Only about 7 houses on each side.  (Middle of nowhere town)  WE are all about the same age, middle teens.  We were just standing there when we looked towards the end of town directly over the road there was this brilliant flash of blue/whitish light, only a few meters above ground.  About 5 seconds after the light presented itself, there was a shake in the air, a boom, but it wasnt loud, but it was strong.  I felt it hit my chest like a box of rocks it was so strong.  The power went out in the entire town.  A few car alarms sounded and were going off.  One of the street lights exploded and the light ambers floated to the ground.  For about 10 seconds the blue/whitish light was the only light we could see.  It didnt illuminate the entire town.  But it was sorta outside of town, but still directly over the road.  The power then returned and the light disappeared as teh street were lit up by street lights again.  My name is Alex Nadelhoffer.  I&apos;am 17 years old.  My number is 1 262 ((number deleted)).  I&apos;am interested to hear someone elses view point on what I might have experienced.  It wasnt rained or storming out either that night So it wasnt lightning.  I was wondering if you could relate this to any other recent reports and if my details are similar to theirs.

Traveled East, then turned South until was no longer visible.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))", "High altitude bright light changing color and intensity and a dim low saucer shape  over SE Macomb County .This was the second sighting of a similar craft from three days earlier.  I had just bought a new telescope on the 14th and was star gazing at about 10 pm.  There were two passerby&apos;s at about 10:20 who saw the high altitude craft. I was outside setting up my new telescope since it was a very clear night and my new telescope&apos;s laser sight was sighted in and ready for use. I first sat down for a smoke then I saw the ufo. It appears to be similar to the last high altitude one I saw and it was the same approximate time, except that this one circled counterclockwise at least three times over the course of the viewing. The circlular flight path was probably at least 5 - 10 miles round, probably more like 20-30 miles. I saw the object when it was at the high altitude to the east through a telescope for a second, the shape looked almost like two D&apos;s piggybacking and was slight bit greenish tint to the light. I saw stars go by right next to the light on all sides so the craft appeared to be only as big as the light. I was surprised to see it appeared as though there were no other dimension to the craft other than the light itself.  When I view planes with a telescope or binoculars at night, they have a gray area where the lights arent and you can see stars get blocked by other parts of the craft not lit. This was not that way at all. Airplane lights also light up part of the fuselage which was not evident on this craft. I heard nothing in the way of aircraft noises, no jet engines, propeller noises or helicopter noises.  F-16&apos;s from Selfridge always make a roar when flying around. Two people came walking by, a man and a woman, and they were pointing at what I was looking at. We met up in my side yard and watched together for a couple of minutes. It was dim then got kind of bright white, then dimmed when I turned my back to get my telescope (wanted to see it again while it was brighter) then the passerbys said that the object dimmed to red and then to off and disappeared to the East over Saint Clair Shores. The walkers both said there was no way that was a plane. The male walker said that he thought the craft looked to be almost in orbit, or much higher than commercial craft. The female walker was telling me that she saw the same kind of light show from craft recently and slugged her companion in the shoulder for telling her that her sighting, which he did not see, was a sattelite.  On this night, the man admitted that this couldnt be a sattelite or an aircraft. All three of us were mildly excited about the UFO, and the couple walked on after about 20 seconds of the craft not being visible. As the walkers left a couple of minutes later I saw the craft come back again from the north heading southbound then turned to the east then north again, this circlular flight path was the smallest of the night and the craft was the lowest it had been to this point. When it got to direct north of my position it disappeared behind trees. Then about 20 seconds after that I saw a white shape, very dimly lit that looked saucer shaped and it looked about the size of a private jet, maybe a little bigger. This was to the Northwest which I had not seen anything in this area before. This time it was much closer but much dimmer and the craft&apos;s surface was all the same dim lit greenish but mostly white color. The object was at only a few thousand feet altitude, looked kind of like the letter D resting on its back and it shot east at incredible speed with non-linear accelleration. The acceleration kind of bounced (hard to describe) then disappeared behind some trees. The wind was from the West at gusts to 20mph, but this object went fast against the wind and the movement looked unreal. At very first glance it appeared almost to be a white balloon in the dark, but the movement was so unorthodox and against the wind and the speed at the end of the acceleration was too high for anything manmade I am aware of. I am guessing that the craft was the same craft in both instances, one higher than the other, but I do not know for sure. For one thing it appeared to go from a double D to a single D (no pun intended)shape, but in the last closest sighting, the color was similar, just far less intense. This portion of the sighting was quite wierd and so beyond my experience that I still have a hard time admitting what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.  PD))", "White light, moving in different directions/speeds and stopped in the night/morning sky.I was driving home from work traveling North-West.  The road is full of curves, so my direction would change a bit, but my house is North-West of my employer.  I got off work at 05:30 AM.  As I was driving home, I noticed 3 lights, that looked just like stars all in a strait line at an angle.  I never saw this before in this part of the sky.  I was trying to look as I was driving, but it was difficult.  I only live 5 minutes from work.  When I arrived home, I went to my back yard and looked for the three stars.  They had moved to a triangle formation, but were in about the same location in the sky.  I did not see them move.  They were very tiny, and looked as if they were small stars.  The light from them was bright white.  Then as I was watching them, just sitting still, to my right was one that was traveling towards the others.  It looked exactly like the other three, except that this one was moving and I didn&apos;t whiteness the others moving except that I noticed that they had changed formation from the last time I seen them.  This one continued to move until it was close to the others, then stopped.  I tripped my motion halogen light on the side of my house by accident, and it lit up so bright that it was difficult to see, so I walked further out back.  It was also early in the morning, so the sky had lightened some.  I could still see the lights, but they were not as bright.  Then the one that was moving before, began to move again.  There was no sound.  It was as if it were very far above me.  It would move steady, then shoot at a small angle, then slow back down and move steady, then shoot at a small angle as if it were trying to zig zag, but continued to travel in the same direction that it was when it would slow a bit and travel steady.  In a matter of about 5 minutes, it traveled from my right hand side, all the way to my left hand side to where I couldn&apos;t see it anymore as it moved with the curvature of the atmosphere and disappeared.  It had no blinking lights like an airplane, ! but was bright white, like a small star.  I was facing south when I saw the lights.  It traveled from the South-West to the South-East.  The others just stayed in position.  After about another 5 minutes watching them not do anything and turning my head to try and find the one that had moved and disappeared, I went in the house and woke my wife to tell her what had happened.  I then went back outside to see if they were still there, but the sun had come up and it was too light out.  I couldn&apos;t see them anymore.  I do not drink, nor do I do any drugs.  I am mentally sane.  I am not into comic books, or a star wars/star trek fan.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I have seen shooting stars before many times, and this was not one of them.", "I saw a rectangular shaped object on the western horizon glowing orange I saw a jet intercepting the object and then abruptly turn away from it.the object disappeared.  There was no normal Commercial Plane Traffic after this for atleast 20 minutes.Normally the skys are full of aircraft during this time.", "Returning from vacation I saw a flourescent green object fall from the sky.About 2 to 2 and a half hours into my drive to New Jersey from Fort Pierce, Fla. I noticed a bright green object fall from about a mile above the earth.  It appeared to glow a flourescent green and descend rather rapidly, leaving behind a trail of green light.  I am not sure of the size of the object, nor how far away from my location it was.((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor?

I thought to myself, cool a shooting star, except when it came into view in front of my windshield, it had no tail. Just a glowing sphere like object with no sound. I thought for something to be moving that fast it would have a loud sonic boom. It was traveling north at an extreme rate of speed. Probably well over 1000 mph, and then it went over the horizon. This lasted no more than one second. I thought to myself there is no way I just saw what I think I saw, maybe it was an just an airplane.I was within a half of a mile of the airport, so I drove by it to see if there was a plane on the runway. When I got there, I remembered that McCollum Field or Cobb County Airport only has one runway running East and West, no North and South runway. I pulled up the airports&rsquo; website and they are not even opened from midnight though six in the morning. I have seen hundreds of shooting stars before and I know what they look like. My house is across the street from the airport, so I have a good idea of what comes in and out of it.I have never believed in UFO&rsquo;s or sophisticated intelligent life outside of Earth, but whatever I saw tonight was definitely not from around here.

Within a couple minutes the &ldquo;star&rdquo; began sporadically moving, stopping in the east sky. The sun was just coming up but had not yet impaired my vision. It immediately became clear that the object was no longer star-shaped, but more V-shaped. It was white, like a wisp of cloud. I watched for about 20 minutes as it appeared to alternately thrash about, then float. After those 20 minutes  it&rsquo;s movements stabilized and it moved toward the east and gradually upward.

I&apos;m an amateur astronomer/sky watcher and had a pair of 16X Nikons. I noticed a rather bright &quot;star&quot; moving from the NW to the SE. I watched it for @3 seconds and it disappeared. Then 3-4 seconds later it reappeared, still traveling in the same direction. I got the binoculars on it and it appeared simply as one of the brighter stars, in motion and with a constant glow. It repeated this twice, on the last &quot;illumination&quot; it came to a dead stop, increased in brightness @ 4X, remained at this maximum illumination for @ 2 seconds, and disappeared. That&apos;s it. As I said, this object appeared as nothing more than a moving star, a rather common sighting of terrestrial origins. It was not moving exceptionally fast, it was the on/off of the &quot;light&quot; and it&apos;s finale that I found unusual. As for altitude I can&apos;t speculate beyond that, though not in what would be called space, it was MUCH higher than conventional civilian/commercial aircraft operate at.

There were four red spheres about one meter in diameter hovering over the back yard of a home on the street we were driving on.  They looked like they were big lights on a pole, but when we slowed down to look at them they rose higher into the air and went into a formation with one about a 100 feet above the ground with the other three just over the tree tops.  We followed them as they went out to the boulevard and began flying lower and in a seemingly systematic pattern over the neighbourhood.  Another vehicle stopped on the street and was observing the red &quot;balls of light&quot; as well.  They continued slowly flying over the neighbourhood for about 15 or 20 minutes until they went up and over a hill and out of sight.
