["Similar craft spotted again. Second sighting within a week. Check my first reportThis was similar to my encounter a few days ago, only that each craft moved in completely different directions. The first one was a star-like looking object with a 1 second interval flash very similar to the fourth craft I saw a few days ago. It moved fairly slow from South to North. The second one was identical without a flash and moved from West to East. The third, identical appearance, except it moved freely wherever it wanted. It started from the South and strayed towards the Northwest zigzagging a few times. This time my girlfriend was with me as opposed to my last encounter. She witnessed 2 of the 3 craft. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s still continuing because I saw three within 10 minutes.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Meteorologist Tony Zaleski of the National Weather Service in Chanhassen says the white object appears to be higher than the white, whispy cirrus clouds, which means it&apos;s probably higher than 30,000 feet. Although the object looked like it might be rotating, it doesn&apos;t appear to be going anywhere. Zaleski says that probably would rule out a satellite. Patrick Hogan at the Metropolitan Airports Commission says folks in the tower at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport thought it might be a weather balloon. But Zaleski says if that&apos;s true, the Weather Service didn&apos;t release it. The Federal Aviation Administration hasn&apos;t returned calls about the mysterious object.((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the Twin Cities area.  At first, we thought the object might be a balloon, launched from Canada, as part of the MANTRA scientific project, but the balloon had not yet been launched on August 19.

At first glance I thought it was a firefly caught in the illumination of a distant street light, but then I realized that there was no light in the direction I was looking. What convinced me that it was a craft of some sort in particular was seeing the other 2 lights that were clearly planes of some sort with the red and blue wing lights flashing that were flying around the edge of the storm.  In comparison to those this light was just a single solid orb that seemed further into the heart of the storm.  It moved around for about a minute and then dipped towards the ground where my view was obscured by a neighbors house.

I have never seen anything that fast in the sky...I mean, it was RIDICULOUSLY fast.  The light was bright red.  If I hadn&apos;t been looking directly at it, I would have never seen it...it was at least as fast as a shooting star.

We (the work crew) was camped out about seven or eight miles in from the road, up in the mountains.

I went out to the edge of the meadow, to where my tent was pitched, to watch the stars for a while before crashing myself...

I stepped outside as well and he pointed out an object in the sky.  It was extremely bright, low on the western horizon and large.  It appeared to be hovering not too far from us.  At first we thought it was possibly a helicopter because we could hear the sound of one approaching but we realized it was not coming from the light but an actual helicopter heading towards the light itself.  This helicopter departed the scene after a red light seemed to dart out from the light itself.  At least 6 military jets were circling the light at a much higher altitude, keeping a good distance between it and them.  The light hovered still for about 10 minutes and then moved very quickly to the right before continuing to hover.  My 8 year old son came out to see what we were staring at and shouted &quot;It&apos;s a spaceship!&quot;.  I told him that I didn&apos;t know what it was but it was definitely odd.  Two other neighbors were outside and appeared to be watching it as well. We were still debating whether or not it was a search helicopter because it certainly did not seem like one.  There was a strobing effect to the light in an alternating yellow/green pattern.  We realized that it was moving once again, this time away from us, due west.  Although it was diminishing in size, the brightness of the object stayed constant and at the same altitude.  At that point, we realized that what we were looking at was not the headlight of a helicopter at all. We watched it until we could see it no more because houses obstructed the view.  When it departed, the military entourage departed as well and it was a normal quiet Gallup, NM evening once again. The last sight that we had of it, it seemed to blink red once.  The rest of the time, it was just an extremely bright white light in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at the dramatically twinkling star, that would have been visible in the southwest sky on the time and date indicated by the witness.

At first I thought it was an aircraft but then realized there was no sound and if it were landing lights on an aircraft at say airliner cruzing altitudes it would not have been as bright as it was.  The light was moving at a steady pace (like an airliner) when it suddenly dissapered and then reapered on the western horizon just a moment later (3 seconds, entirely too fast to be an airplane) this time the light had stopped moving.  it stayed at its present spot for about three minutes and then it appered to start climbing straight up. (not going east to west or north to south just straight up)  the light was getting smaller as it climbed untill it looked like a faint distant star and moved at an amazing speed back to the eastern horizon and disapered.

To the north west there was a small object that looked like an airplane or a star at first glance, but when we watched it, it stayed in one spot, sometimes moving from side to side quickly, but back to its same spot again.  When we looked at it through the binoulars you could clearly see red, blue and green lights moving in a circle around the object.  They looked like Christmas lights, they were so colourful and brilliant.  The object looked like a sort of triangle, big at the top and skinnier towards the bottom.  We watched for about 40 mins and then it faded off, getting farther away, then reappearing for a second and then completely gone.

I have reported this type of event several times over the past month.  Once again, I was looking east from my back patio.  The sky was mostly blue with a few patchy areas of high clouds.  I see the starlike object again, like a small point of light; through binoculars it looks like a whitish sphere.  I am an avid skywatcher and am very adept at spotting tiny objects in the sky; no one else would have likely seen this unless they&apos;d been deliberately looking closely.  In fact between trying to find it in the binocs (my arms get tired holding the binocs up) and looking with naked eye, it was not easy to keep track of; yet it remained very nearly stationary for about 2 minutes.  As I was looking at it through binoculars, it very quickly took off moving to the south/southeast.  I did not take my eyes off it until it went past the line of my roof, which took roughly 15 to 20 seconds.  So from stationary to very rapidly moving, yet again -- as reported earlier in the month. I was not going to report the following but since I&apos;m submitting something, about a half-hour prior to the white sphere sighting of today, I also saw a metallic red sphere, also seemingly motionless and very high in the sky (hard to notice).  Could not tell through binocs whether it was a red mylar balloon or what; but I lost sight of it and couldn&apos;t find it again after just a minute or two.  Four minutes later, at 1.32 PM, I saw an aircraft fly overhead and over the area of the sky in which I&apos;d seen the red sphere: in the direction of DIA (to the northeast).  Some aircraft today have been leaving short contrails, others have not. This was leaving a contrail, two streams rather farther apart than a normal aircraft; I looked through binoculars and what I saw took me by surprise.  This was some sort of military craft I&apos;m sure; a dull gray, flattened triangle.  There was no fuselage; it was just a large gray wing, much wider than long, with the shorter point of the triangle in the direction of flight.  The sound was similar to a regular jet, although it did seem to rumble a bit longer than I would have expected as it disappeared in the distance.  I got a good look at it; it was definitely no ordinary airplane or jet.", "My husband and I went to the &quot;flats&quot; in Cleveland (restaurants and club scene that line both sides of the Cuyahaga River...Left Bank and Right Bank.

As we stood looking, I looked up and noticed a white fuzzy light above us traveling in an oval shaped pattern, and each time it revolved at the right end it sort of &quot;flashed&quot; slightly and without stopping, continued it&apos;s revolution.  I mentioned it to my husband as it looked to be part of the low cloud coverage (it was very cloudy that evening)....or &quot;above&quot; and in the cloud itself.  He thought it was caused by party/search lights, but there was no line of light source to this moving light.  I watched it circle above me, and it appeared to cover about 60 feet from where I stood...I do not know how low it was..and that is strange because the clouds were low, but...it was as high as the cloud....I am a skywatcher, and it just gets me that hardly anyone looks up at the sky.  As we proceeded to walk to the right bank, the &quot;light&quot; followed us.  We crossed a bridge, we walked across a very long empty parking lot....still above us.

When we decided to back track and walk back to our car (same distance), it did the same thing.  My husband just ignored it, and that was a little weird...I thought maybe he just did not want to know any more about it....I decided to stop looking at it.  I never mentioned it to anyone at the club because they would probably laugh at me....but when we were on the &quot;dock&quot; patio...the people out there were just dancing or drinking or talking and not paying attention.  It seemed strange that no one would look up...anyway...I cannot figure this one out...My rational mind is trying to reason it out...but this light had an intelligence about it.

I live in western New York near the shore of Lake Ontario and this is a common sight on warm, sunny days.My wife was with me and I commented to her that it looked awfully high.  At about this time the object disappeared behind a small cirrus cloud.  I then knew it was not a buzzard and ran into the house a got binoculars.  By the time I got back outside the object was directly above me.My initial thought looking at it with the glasses was that it was a bald eagle because the color was right and had what appeared to be a white head.  After watching it make a few circles I could see that it was a circular craft and when it banked with top facing sun there was a bright metalic shine like stainless steel.  It traveled slowly across the sky from west to east continualy making circles.After five minutes it was east at about forty degrees to horizon and approaching solid cloud cover.I wondered if it was still visible without the binoculars and attemped to locate it without them.Just as I spotted it, it suddenly changed direction, looping north over the lake and headed west at blazing speed.  I said to my wife &quot;look at that sucker go&quot; and just that quick it was gone.  Went in house and checked time, 12:10 PM. Object&apos;s shape:  Circular with portion missing, like a clock face with portion between 5 and 7 cut away. This missing section extended to center of craft and always faced to the outside of the loops it was flying.  It looped counterclockwise. Object&apos;s size:  Hard to determine not knowing its altitude.  I checked local weather information on the internet and clould cover in region was listed at 20,000 feet.  It was above the clouds. As stated before I thought it was a turkey buzzard soaring. Color:  Brownish to light black on bottom.  Top portion visible only when banked facing sun was very shiny, like polished stainless steel.  At certain points in the loop it shone like a mirror reflecting sunshine. My conclusion:  I think this craft was purposely drawing attention to it by its pecuilar motion.  If it had been traveling in straight flight I would not have noticed it.  Anyone looking to the west as it approached could not have missed seeing it.", "Multipul &quot;blinkers&quot; with red ,blue and white strobing lights, across the sky. only one circle shaped.07/16/04. from dusk till dawn the ufo&apos;s w/blinking red,blue and white lights were across the sky.The lights looked just like the L.E.D. lights used on the Texas st. trooper cruiser.very vivid and could be seen clearly all night. Some appeared to be docked @ one location,the others wre roaming across the sky at will. They were all exactly the same in dimentions and appearance. From due east at 3:00am a single ufo appeared,roughly 060 degrees magnetic. this one was huge when compared to the blinkers.AT first, I thought it was a weather balloon. This one rose in the sky to maybe 45 degrees,Blinked off and on twice very slowly. IT sat still a few seconds and started changeing color. From white to plum to orange and back to white with a pea green ring around it that looked hot.Almost like steam rising from it. It appeared in that area of the sky untill daylight and no longer visable. The object was very active spinning and changing color. On a few occasions it looked as if its size (overall) was changing. still circular, but smaller or bigger.At daylight all the ufo&apos;s we saw that night just kept doing the same thing until the sun was too bright and they could no longer be seen with naked eye. Several of the observers have been watching the blinkers everynight from 070704  to present. This was the fist time any of this group had seen the big circular object. Tonight,07/16/04 I stood at the ready again but the sky was too cloudy.", "circular, multi-colored, flat objectit was about 1:15 in the morning and me and my friends were about to go to sleep whenever my dad came told us to come outside because he had something he wanted us to look at. he sat us down and let us look through binoculars at this circular object that seemed to be stationary in the sky. it had distinct features such as red, orange, blue, and yellow lights around it. it was moving very fast in short motions right then left then up a little and then would become stationary again. it looked really close. we were stayin at our camp out on the amite river right by lake marapaus in east ascension parish right by I40. there were many sightings there and we didnt know what it was. around 6 o&apos;clock we went outside and it was still there. right before the sun came up it looked like there were a white light in the middle of the craft and then just shot up into the sky so fast you could barely see it. there were at least 3 of them but the one that stood out the most was extremely close and it seemed to be the biggest of them.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been looking at Sirius.

(This would be an South-North/NorthEast movement for me. There is a house across the street and a treeline. There are some power lines but I would say from my second floor window, it looked to be about 50-75 feet higher than the treeline. I have heard of some reports in the area of lights or mysterious obkects in the sky. I would say that it was a very bright silver metallic color and moved about 50 mph to me.

I am slow in reporting this, but after seeing the info concerning the objects(spheres of light)sighted in Mexico, I felt compelled to write about what I had witnessed.The night/early morning of my sighting was the night we invaded Iraq. I had been on the computer most of the night talking with friends and following links about what was happening world wide. I was upset about the war,and at about 1:30 I finally turned the computer off and walked out onto my back deck, which faces directly South. As I stood there breathing in the cool night air, I was looking up at the sky, just thinking about the war and such. Over to my right,Southwest, at about 50 degrees, I saw a trail(pieces)of fire shooting off to my right into the night sky. My first thought, someone is shooting off a flare of some sort? (I live in the country miles from town and city lights)...then directly in front of me 90 degrees, between two large leafless oak trees, Two side by side orbs or spheres of light came on...they just seemed to turn on....if you held two 24&quot; peices of circular paper at arms length, that was how large they appeared in the sky. They seemed very close, or were extremely large. I have seen planes with their landing lights come over before, but, these spheres of light were nothing like that. They were perfectly spaced(like headlights)...the light was a pale white/greenish yellow, a non color really...and there was no illumination coming from the light...I stood there just staring at them, wondering how long would they last,what were they...they were not moving, there was no sound coming from them...then just as quietly as they had turned on, they turned off. Fading to the blackness of the sky. I stood there for maybe 10 minutes or more to see if something else might happen. Nothing did. The next day I asked a friend who was in the military if he had ever heard of government flares of that sort, he told me no, he never had.Thank you for letting me post this. B.", "Very odd Clouds behaving uncloudlikeThursday 8th July 2004. Mazarron, Murcia, Spain. Between 13.45 and 14.00. Hot day, temperatures in high 20&amp;#8217;s C, light breeze, enough to stir the leaves, clear blue skies. No clouds to the north, east or south, Clouds forming to the south west, up and over the distant hills, and moving to the west. These hills start at about four miles south, and run down the coast southward. Walking the dog up the road, in a northwest direction I noticed a bright white cloud ahead. It caught my notice, as there were no other clouds visible in the sky.I walked to within 150 yards of the end of this road, where at the end there are a line of trees, all about 40 to 50 feet high. This cloud seemed to be very close behind the trees and low. Half of it was below the top quarter of the trees, the remainder in clear view. It was swirling like clouds do, changing shape and forming tails that broke off into small pieces of cloud, move away, and seemed to go back into the main cloud. Then the cloud seemed to evaporate a little and re build itsself again. I watched for two or so minutes, and it disappeared totally. I turned back to home, but glanced back about 15 seconds later and the cloud was back again in the same spot.On reaching home, I took my binoculars and went up onto the roof of the block of apartments. I estimate the deck to be about 65 feet high.There are three blocks in a row all of about the same size from the roof you can only see the roof of the next block. There sure enough was the cloud, but it must have been higher than it&amp;#8217;s original position as it appeared to be a few feel higher then the top of the roof of the next block.Photo !. Shows the roof from where I first observed it, point A on the map, behind the left of the two chimney like stacks, and extending midway between the two. It was doing as I previously described, shrinking, fading enlarging and disappearing. It did not drift in any direction, but remained in roughly the same spot, suddenly to vanish completely.There were no other clouds in the sky remember. Suddenly a round cloud, appeared over the top of the hill to the west, a mile from here, marked B on the map, in line with the two palm trees in the centre of the photograph. It was about half an inch across, remained stationary there for about a minute, then vanished.The cloud at point A reappeared within seconds of this.The cloud evaporated again, and the round cloud appeared over the same hill slightly to the right and lower than before. It changed shape, ending up seeming to stand on end in a curved line, and just vanished.It reappeared over the hills at point C on the map, over the end of the line of hills three miles away to the north, remaining stationary. It did not appear to change shape, and seemed a little bigger than when it was closer.I then noticed a large cloud appearing from behind the line of hills to the north, in direct line with the round cloud. It came slowly in a straight line, stopping a distance away from the round cloud, point D on the map. Neither moved as I watched for about a minute. When I glanced back in the to centre of the valley to my amazement there were ten or more small clouds over various parts to the west of the valley, some below and some above the top line of the hills to the north. These cloudlets changed shapes, evaporated or grew larger, some starting with a small dot of white, and developing into small clouds about the size of my little finger. The cloud in the original position (A) was back there.Photo B. Is taken from the point I moved back too, to get out of the sun. I was able to see points C and D, and across the valley to the east. I became aware of a large cloud coming over the hills to the east, eight miles or more from here, the highest hill to the right of the photograph, and it slowly came in a straight line across the middle of the valley, followed by an identical cloud some 15 seconds later, on the course as the first. They were travelling at the same speed. The first one at its closest point was between me and the hills to the north east, and there was about two inches of sky between its bottom edge and the tops of the hills. It seemed to be about four inches long. It stopped at a point just before the cream wall in the photograph. Both of them stopped, at points E and F on the map, and began to evaporate, and I looked at the two other clouds at C and D and they too were fading.There was not a cloud to be seen. After a few minutes the original cloud re appeared.I had to leave at this point. Sighting lasted 25 mins. On the roof At 18.00 hours I had to go out, and the cloud was once again over the trees at the end of the road. I did not have time to observe it, and it was gone when I returned an hour later. There were no other clouds in the sky anywhere.I have drawn the clouds as best I can. They were like no clouds I have ever seen, in formation, movement across the sky and lack of movement within itsself. This area is semi arid, with the valley floor covered with plastic greenhouses, but no industry. I checked for a fire as the possible source of the clouds, but there were none. I Thought maybe the local climate could have caused this effect, however this is unlikely, as we have had a week of similar weather conditions, some days with clouds, all of them very high in the sky, and all of them behaving as one would expect clouds to behave. They were unlike any clouds I have ever seen, (both from above and below  clouds). I have a map and three location photographs.

I was camping with my brother and his two sons. It was their first campout. We stayed up until about 00:00 8/14/04. Between the hours of 00:00 and 03:00 I had a strange dream.I have alot of strange dreams, nothing new. I dream of a red-ish light shinning from outside the adirondak and a high pitch pentrating noise associated with it. The light and sound were paralising me and forcing me to sleep. I dreamed I was fighting to stay awake, trying to get to my pistol. I dreamed I had the pistol in my sleeping bag. At three in the morning I awoke and heard owls. I looked for my pistol in my sleeping bag were I was sure I had put it.It was however outside the bag were I had left it when I went to sleep. I said to my brother, &quot;Are You Awake?&quot; He said Yes. I said &quot;Do you hear those owls?&quot; He said,&quot;They sound like little kids playing.&quot; We were all awake, each one of us. At 0300 in the morning. I got up and put more wood on the fire with the help of my younger nephew. At 0335 we all tried to go back to sleep, but the kids kept screwing around. So my brother got up at 0410, and we all got up.I knew I&apos;d had a few wierd dreams and told about them, but I held back the dream of the paralizing light. I didn&apos;t want to scare the kids. I knew it was an alien encounter kind of a dream. What was really strange, what prompted me to send this e-mail, and what has me thinking about this whole campout, is what my brother said that morning. He said that &quot;Sometime after we went to sleep, after 00:00, he had looked out of the adirondack and the woods were all lit-up like a full moon. He describe how the leaves on the trees had reflected the moonlight. Well there was barely a moon on the night of 8/13/04, with the new moon on 8/16/04.

As we were lying on our backs observing the night sky, one of the scouts points to the northeast and said &quot;hey look Sputnik&quot;. Sure enought moving at what seemed a slow rate of speed was a light in the night sky (it would have looked like a star if it had not been moving). As the light moved from the northeast to the southwest, another scout shouted look there&apos;s another one. Looking to the southwest we saw a second light which appeared to be a copy of the first moving from the southwest to the northeast on a collision couse with the first.  Although they were very far apart and moving slow, over the next 20 to 30 min.s they had come within approximatly an inch of one another. Then a flash of light occurred between the two objects and the one on the right coming from the southwest disappeared and the one from the northeast continued it&apos;s southwestern flight until it disappeared some time later.

He said that he saw it but it looked very small from where he was, as i was heading in the direction it was in. The light seemed to move across the sky as i looked at it, but as odd as it sounds, i couldnt quite tell what direction it was moving in. The light seemed to hover and move vertical down slowly then back up. I faintly remember the light fading from its normal white to a sort of red and back again. I came to a parking lot of a resteraunt and pulled over and got out and called my dad for some reason to tell him about it.

At approximately 10:50 PM, we stopped along the side of the highway to videotape the objects when we noticed that they had broken their formation.  The three objects which were traveling in a &quot;V&quot; formation were now only two.  I got some really good detailed footage of the two objects since the digital camera I was using has 240X digital zoom. As I focused in on one object to get more detail, the other one took off. What happened next I failed to get on video  but we also saw what appeared to be a rectangular shaped ship.  (Or a portion of a ship which was siver or gray but it was only a partial view)  For those star trek fans out there it appeared to have a holodeck look to it.  Like when you can see a portion of the holodeck when a majority of it still held the particular hologram it was projecting.  It was also masked behind what looked like clouds.  This occured for a few seconds then it too dissapeared.  A few seconds later the last ship also appeared to vanish. This ocurred about 10:52PM PST.

This was at 11:02PM PST, we pulled over again to video the objects in which all three were back but in different formation all together. Two of the objects were side by side and the third was now quite a distance from the others. We continued to capture the event until 11:04PM PST when we finally got back to the drive to Phoenix. I managed to get some great footage of the sighting and am amazed at the detail of the objects captured.  They changed not only dimension during our filming but also it seemed that they changed in composition.  What appeared to be a fireball one second changed to a flashing orb like object to finally almost a gaseous compostion, in which you can see it is definately a rounded object but also that their is definate light and that they are traveling in a circular motion.", "Bright Triangle Accompanied by 3 jets.2nd Submission because date was wrong it should be 08/11/04  My husband and I witnessed a very large bright light (larger than Venus in am)moving moderately from North East to South West. It was accompanied by 3 blinking red lights which we decided were jets because we could hear their engines. The jets did not stay in any formation with it but moved around craft. When it was directly overhead we realized that it was a triangle shape.  After it reached a certain point South West of us it apparently turned (trees were in our way) and began to head in a West to East direction. At that time we lost sight of it.", "Triangular UFO witnessed over Kelowna B.C.At about 2:30 am over Rutland Kelowna, a triangular UFO was witnessed flying in an Eastward direction. It had six lights on the bottom, 3 yellowish ones in the center that formed a triangle as well. 1 red one at the top point and 2 blue ones at the bottom points. It also had 1 white light at the back that was flashing. As it neared the 3 witnesses they could hear a hover like sound, which no plane could ever make. It wasn&apos;t going very fast at all, way too slow for any plane to go. It wasn&apos;t very high in the sky either. Again at 3:30 am they witnessed it again but going in the opposite direct(Westward) but it was higher in the sky this time.", "The 4 objects moved very rapidly from east to west, then dissappeared.We were camping at Spicer Reservour just below Bear Valley, CA with another couple.  My friend and I decided to go fishing in his small boat about 0700.  We motored out across the lake to begin trolling.  After a while his motor stopped running.  As he was fixing his fishing pole, I began to hear a faint Jet engine sound approaching.  Because I am a pilot and work in aviation, I always look up to indentify aircraft.  The sound was approaching from the east and behind me.  I looked and followed the sound but saw nothing.  I continued until the sound was overhead.  This is when I saw the ball shapped objects side by side.  They were probably 1,000 ft AGL, moving at maybe 200 to 250 KTS or faster.  They were aircraft aluminum in color.  They all moved independently of each other and appeared to be trying to stay side by side at the same speed.  My friend then looked but did not see them.  He did hear the sound.  They continued to the west for about 1 more second, then dissapeared", "Flash in the sky in Plainfield, ILI was driving home from a friends house when I took a wrong turn down a farm road.  I turned around and continued driving.  I noticed that all of the sudden it got brighter everywhere.  I looked up at the sky to see a flash that engulfed my entire field of vision.  It looked like a lighting strike but the sky was totally clear and there was no bolt.  It was just a flash centered in one area of the sky.

There are a lot of military aircraft in the area, so it seems like I&apos;m always looking up. I watched the cloud, nothing came out.? Bear in mind, I was driving,probably about 30 mph, so I had to keep one eye on the road. Usually military, and some commercial aircraft,I would have heard, but I heard nothing. I pulled over. I watched the cloud for ten minutes. Nothing came out. I wear glasses,so I&apos;m not above saying I could have been mistaken. It just seemed so clear. The sky was clear with white clouds on a blue sky. What I call a Simpson sky. I don&apos; have the ability to judge the distance of a cloud, but if I had to guess I would guess ten miles away. I just came directly in and entered &quot;ufo&quot;on my computer to see if maybe someone else saw it.", "Objects in the sky give terrific light show!!!This started as a small white light blip in the sky, north of the city.  As it came closer, the lights changed color and started to splinter off into different pieces, going in different directions.  It was night time so the night sky gave a good background for the many colors.  We looked through a telescope at these objects as they flew in many different directions, and found that they were actually huge round objects with lights going off and on all the way around them.  This show lasted aproximately 2 hours.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.

I could see this clearly from my yard. There was one above the trees and one in the middle, one in the sky over the big one that was low. The one overhead blinked red lights. The others were dim, but would blink whitish, green, lights. There were also two in the sky looking west from my back yard. They are bright with blue, red, and green lights mixed with white. They hovered there for about 1 hour and then dissappeared. There were planes flying around them for a while, I just wondered if maybe they saw them? Or why if they couldn&apos;t. My sons friend was sleeping over and I woke him and my son to see the object that was bright over the hills.

I saw an silver disk hoovering about 3 1/8 of my hands held up with the bottom of my hand equal to the breakers on the shore. It was about 100 feet in distance from the shore out across the water in the Eastern not very cloudy blue sky. The object appeared to be 4 1/2 fingers thick , held vertically, and tapered down to a left sharp edged saucer and also on the right side tapered down to a right sharp edged saucer sort of like when you put two china plates with the tops on top of each other held horizontally only thicker in the middle.I only saw one saucer flying off in a south-easterly direction slowly at first then gaining speed.The time it took to leave was to count to 18 taking normal counts not in a hurry and by the twenty &amp; the twenty-third count it was gone into thin air way off South-east of myself and a fellow witness.I said to him, &quot;Did you see that?,&quot;Or am I crazy!&quot; Then he replied, &quot; No youre not crazy cause I saw it too ,dont worry about it.&quot;", "round fuzzy light finally seen through binocularsI have reported these before but got a good look at them through 20x50 binoculars. from a distance they look like bright circles with a halo around them but as of tonight i saw two within 5 minutes of eachother. one was far to fast to see. the second i caught for about 5 seconds through the binoculars.it came from the south to southeast, fast but not zipping to much. it was sort of triangular shaped which surprised me, almost like a glowing paper airplane with pointed up wings. i finally lost it as it zipped and zagged and dissappeared. the whole thing lasted for about 10 seconds. i have my neighbors looking at them also. one of my neighbors is in search and rescue and has served in the navy for 12 years and never saw anything at sea or out like this. i love tracking sattellites and have loved astronomy since i was a boy. i cannot explain these things in the night sky yet. i will keep watching.", "I am a business consultant with an MBA currently on vacation, renting a beach house on the Connecticut shore. My 14-yr-old nephew and my 18 yr-old babysitter saw UFOs first. I arrived home with my 22 yr-old niece at about 10:30 pm on 8/25 and they were excited, having seen about 10 &quot;sparkling&quot; objects flying in the sky above Long Island Sound. As I spoke with them about it, several more appeared in the sky, and by midnight we had seen approximately 40 of them. They would fly from over the ocean to inland, all in the same direction, approx. SE to NE. Several of these objects would fly in triangle or trapazoid patterns and looked to deliberately fly close and then closely cross each other&apos;s flight paths. At times, they looked like they might crash. Two flew very low over our heads and we could see the bottom of one. It looked like a triangle with a light at each point. When the objects flew over, a low flying helicopter appeared and at first appeared to follow one of the objects, but then contiuned straight on its path, away from the object. During this 2 hour period, there was a very low &quot;planet&quot; sitting over the water. It was motionless, large, shiny and sparkled red, blue, green and white. At 11:50, it stopped sparkling, dimmed and flew off in the direction of the other objects. None of these objects made any noise - all were completely silent. The next night we sat out at 10:15 pm to see if we&apos;d see them again and did. We saw approximately 30 &quot;sparklers&quot; flying in the same direction as the previous night and behaving the same way as had the others. We also sat out last night and saw approximately 10 &quot;sparklers&quot; - same MO. I contacted an Air Force office in New Haven (a number I received from 411) and they said there were no bases in CT, Montauk was not being used (closest military base to us, although it was closed decades ago), they were not flying over Madison, Ct and the objects &quot;were not ours.&quot;  We will sit out tonight to see if any more of these strange objects appear. Post Script: Also: On the second night, a large bright white object appeared low in the sky over the water, arced directly down towards the water and disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness on several occasions, and she sounds sincere and credible to us.  We do not know what the witnesses observed.

I observed another airliner come into my view, going the opposite direction from my plane. I had a very clear view of the plane for a few seconds as we passed each other. I was surprised to see a completely separate, smaller metallic aircraft positioned just under the commercial jet at the rear section. I have never seen any other aircraft with this craft&apos;s design. Its design revealed an obviously high level of precision, with no visible windows, and some sort of short, swept back wingspan. The craft appeared to be drafting the larger airliner, and very capably flying along with the highest part of its fuselage and tail area approximately 3 feet from the bottom of the airliner. The craft appeared to be a light brownish gold color. This is first report I have filed with this information.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))In response to your questions:The jet above the craft in question was a large commercial airliner. It was definitely not a USAF plane, and there was clear daylight between the two crafts. I&apos;m guesstimating that the unidentified craft was approximately 20&apos; to 25&apos; in length, and about 6&apos; vertical height at its thickest point. Its outline from the side view could be described as a hard edged, horizontal teardrop.

School had just started about a month ago, it was a Sunday evening sometime between 9 to 10 pm. Three freind&apos;s and myself where playing on some large sandpile&apos;s that the county had put beside the highway on the southeast corner of town getting ready to oil the blacktop. The four of us where trying to enjoy the last few minute&apos;s of our weekend before having to go back to school the next day, by playing a game of war by throwing small dirt clod&apos;s at eachother as we ran around and over the sandpile hiding and trying to get into a good position to throw a clod at someone.I was somewhere on the south end of the pile&apos;s, ((name #1 deleted)) and ((name #2)) where on the west side and ((name #3 deleted)) was on the east. We where all having a good time when suddenly Kyle stood up and pointed to the west and said what is that, (and got hit by sevral clod&apos;s) I stopped and looked to the west and noticed two redish&#x5C;orange light&apos;s in the sky. Ed and Randy looked too and we all ran over the sandpile to the east side where Kyle was and all got down on our stomach&apos;s where we could just see over the top and watched the light&apos;s come closer. After a minute or two we got up and moved to the south side of the pile&apos;s and stood next to the highway to where we could get a better view of what we where seeing. As they came closer the two light&apos;s that we where watching took shape. The redish&#x5C;orange round light&apos;s turned as they came closer to us a kind of arrowhead shape, but with rounded end instead of coming to a sharp point&apos;s. The closest shape I&apos;ve seen to the shape of these thing&apos;s are the shape of the starfleet insigna pin&apos;s on the uniform&apos;s of the crew of the old Star Trek tv show. As we where watching the two craft come closer Kyle again spotted another craft that was coming behind the other two and a little lower. It was quite clear by now that these where not just light&apos;s but some type of craft. All three craft where travling from west to east in a straight line and maybe some 500 or 600 feet up by my best guess. Just to the north are two big grain elevator&apos;s and flour mill where  Hudson Cream Flour is made  and our town is known for stand. And I would say that if these craft where traveling in line with the elevator&apos;s they would of had to move up in altitude or fly around them they where that low. The first craft was traveling in a line that would take it on a path some hundred feet north of us, the second craft was right behind and to the south of the first and the third craft was about a quarter mile behind the first two and maybe a hunderd feet lower but in line with the first two. As the first two got close to the w! estern edge of town the third craft that was behind the first two sped up and caught up to the first two to where it was some fifty feet and right in line behind the first one. As I said they where arrowhead shaped and a redish&#x5C;orange in color, and they pulsated bright and then dimmer slowly, and you could see that the shape of them seemed to be a solid redish&#x5C;orange but made of light, then extending outward&apos;s was a lighter dimmer corona of light ray&apos;s coming out from the more soild core. You could&apos;nt see a edge  or the hull of what would be a solid body to the craft, just light as if the where made of light only. There where no door&apos;s window&apos;s or seam&apos;s to the shape, nothing that you could see that would help you in being able to say what was the front back top bottom of them other than there overall shape and the direction of there flight, with the point narrow end pointed to the east in the direction of travel. The craft where some onehunderd feet long, fifty feet wide at the widest and some twentyfive feet tall, from my best guess. As they pasted over there was no sound at all from them, but you could kind of feel the pulsing in the center of your chest as they grew brighter and then dimmed. As the craft passed the last one being the lowest was so close that I could of thrown a dirtclod and hit it if I would of thought to. The night of the sighting was a calm clear summer eaving, the sun was just a dim  glow on the western horizon, the star&apos;s where out and no cloud&apos;s or wind at all.When the craft where first sighted by Kyle the first two where about a mile west of town and some twohunderd feet north of the highway that run&apos;s west&#x5C;east threw the south end of town. After they passed over head we watched them travle east of town some two and a half to three mile&apos;s. The total lenght of time of the sighting was about twenty minute&apos;s or so. They flew very slowly, from watching plane&apos;s mainly crop duster&apos;s that flew over the feild&apos;s when I was a kid and later in life seeing hot air ballon&apos;s fly, I now know that I have never seen any type of craft that fly&apos;s move so slowly. Not plane&apos;s, hotair balloon&apos;s, or even toy ballon&apos;s move this slowly, maybe a helicopter in a slow foward hover could but not without making a lot of noise and generating a lot of wind. And when the craft got to the far east of there flight path they all three at the same time kind of turned there nose&apos;s northward and uppward to the northeast very slowly and just took off at a very hi rate of speed to where they just where gone in less than a second in a streak of light. And one strange thing about the way they moved as they made there turn, they did&apos;nt make a banking turn like a plane would dipping one wing and moving in a arc changing there direction of travel and position together to make the turn. These craft moved from some center point moving there nose&apos;s to the north and uppward to the northeast, but there direction of travel continued straight eastward it was most strange and unlike any aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen make a turn while in flight. And just when the nose of the craft finnished the move to the northeast to change corse for a new direction of flight they just accelerated very fast in a streak of light until in less than a second they where lost in the star&apos;s in the sky.We all stood there for less than a minute and without saying anything to eachother just turned and went to our home&apos;s. The next day after school we all came together and walked with eachother not talking for a short time when Kyle said what was it we saw last night, and I remeber Ed replying, they said we wasn&apos;t suppost to talk about it. And we all seperated and went our own way to go home. And we never talked about it again.It was not until year&apos;s later when I was in my early twenty&apos;s that I even remebered or thought about this sighting until after I reading a book on ufo&apos;s for something differnt to read. Before reading the book I never had any intrest in ufo&apos;s or anything that was outside the norm? And now year&apos;s later I wonder about what we saw that night and I wander even more about who Ed was talking about when he said they said that we wasn&apos;t suppost to talk about it.All of this in this statement is the truth as best I am able to rember. And I belive that it was a real event that I shared with three freind&apos;s in a small Kansas town one summer eaving. What was it we saw and who they where that  Ed eluded to I have no ideal. But after much reading on the subject of ufo&apos;s and alien&apos;s and remebering other sighting&apos;s and thing&apos;s that happened to us a kid&apos;s I can&apos;t  help but to think that maybe they are here and sometime&apos;s visit small town&apos;s in Kansas for whatever reason..((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

The caller identified himself as a retired 72 YOA Duluth Georgia businessman. He stated that he and his &quot;date&quot; had witnessed an unusual event in 1949, but he had not reported the incident to anyone due to being temporarily AWOL from the Air Force in order to go on the outing.  Witness stated that it was either the spring or fall of 1949 and he was in the U.S. Air Force, attending a military training school, and was overdue because of his date. He and his friend were in MARION ALABAMA (Perry County, west central Alabama) near her farmhouse home. The weather was nice and mild, and they were standing under a tree in the front yard. She suddenly observed something in the sky behind him and pointed it out. He looked and they both observed several ROUND, AERIAL, BLACK ORBS in the far distance. They were in what he described as a diamond formation, appearing back-lit, seeming to make them black, and about the size of an ASPIRIN held at arms length. He recalled there being FOUR ROUND OBJECTS/ORBS, perhaps 15 degrees above the horizon. As they watched, said orbs DOVE DOWN toward the horizon and vanished. Event duration was much less than a minute, perhaps just moments, and occurred at what he recalled was about 3:00-4:00PM.  Witness DID NOT notice any unusual physiological or psychological effects, nor any influence on his watch or other devices.  This witness is obviously intelligent, educated and well spoken, and seemed very forthright and serious during the telephone interview. His recounting of the event remained CONSISTENT as FOCUS was applied to several areas of his experience.  While a field investigation into such a BRIEF event so REMOTE in time is not feasible, this report is being documented for HISTORICAL PURPOSES. Efforts will be made to locate similar accounts in that general area and time frame. That part of Alabama is rural today, and was MORE SO in 1949, being just SW of the massive Talladega National Forest.

I got my wife out of bed. By the time she came to the kitchen, which was only a few mins, it had moved further away and at a slightly different angle, making it impossible to see it as 5 lights. Rather, by this time it was just one bright light. I called 911 and 3 policemen came to the house. They saw the light in the sky, which I photographed by the time they arrived.

I was wearing sunglasses but still could not make out its exact shape. My best guess was that it looked like three bright shiny baloons or spheres connected together that seemed to reflect suns light or emit bright white light. The baloons or speres of light seemed to change shapes. It took the shape of a triangle and then change to form a cylinder shape. Two minutes passed and the object seemed to quickly ascend high in the atmosphere and appeared to look like a bright star and climbing much higher and going east south east and getting harder to see.

I saw movement, looked like just another star, but moving. This object had to be way up there, it was a size of a small star. No blinking lights, no color, just looked like every other star up there, except it moved, and moved and stopped ever so often. I followed this movement , thinking it was a satlite ( which I have seen, they move in a straight line, and also look like a normal star, I see these often when I camp in the rockies) but the movement was all over, not supper fast, but the speed would decrease and increase, or even just stop. So this object, I followed, and then another one caught me eye, its the movement of these objects that catches your eye. Now there are two objects, I watched the two objects fly, and stop, fly and stop. Again no flashing lights, WAY to high up to be a plane, the movement is something i&apos;ve never seen ever in my life! I watched till the two objects flew behind a high cloud thin cloud that was over partially over downtown. When I camp , the view of the stars is clear, but downtown there is light pollution. I took this into consideration, but the MOVEMENT , the stopping, the different speeds. I&apos;m very skeptical person, dont buy into this hollywood, saucer, green little men thing. But what I saw last night had me a bit worried. Maybe other people saw this event, but again, its not obvious just looking up at the stars. I was watching the sky for serveral minutes before I saw movement and the objects. No noise, no beams, nothing of that nature, they were the size of small stars, very high up, and the same color of the surrounding stars ( probably due to them being so high up, that the sun reflects back just like the stars).", "Two objects appearing as plantets in photos from the moon etc., appear in place of a white cloud in the north west sky, well after sunsAfter sunset, towards the northwest, against a backdrop of rain storm, a white cloud stayed white long after the sun disappeared, and after sunset.  I wathced the cloud, begining as a little puff, horizontal but very white, it began to drift down towards the earth and divided into two forks, which I thought might be a tornado.  This is why I took the photo.    I took the snapshot on my digital camera, stepping out the back door.  You can see the 8 foot board fence, which gives an idea of elevation of the objects in the sky.    When I downloaded the photo, the cloud is not apparent, but these two objects are visible.  I did not see them, they must have been obscured by the wispy white cloud, but I don&apos;t see how.  They did not appear to move, the cloud eventually disappeared or disappated.", "Four bright cigar-shaped objects held their position high above the Cascades, side by side, for at least 40 minutes.I work as a litigation paralegal for a law firm on the east side of the upper floors of the Bank of America Tower in downtown Seattle. On Monday, August 9, 2004, at about 3 minutes past 8 a.m., I observed from one of the attorney&apos;s office windows 3 small gleaming objects that seemingly were reflecting the sun&apos;s light, located at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. The objects appeared to be either directly over the Cascade Range or to the east of the Cascade Range. These three objects were cigar-shaped and hovered in a straight line, side by side like three dashes, and remained in that position for several minutes. I did not detect any movement from the objects, and I asked two other paralegals to come look. None of us had a camera or camcorder. We located a pair of binoculars and I was the first to look.  I observed that the objects were gray/silver metallic in nature and I think that I am correct in saying that they were reflecting the sun, and thus appeared bright.  The object on the far right moved upwards slightly, and as it moved in those one or two seconds, it did not gleam.  I suspect it was at such an angle as to not reflect the sunlight.  As it took its new position slightly above and diagonally to the right of the others, a fourth gleaming object came out from behind the object on the far left, and lined up with the other objects. It looked similar to these dashes:    _ _ _ -  I asked the paralegal with me if she had just seen what had happened.  She said, &quot;Do you mean that the one on the right blinked and a fourth one came out on the left?&quot;  She took a turn looking with the binoculars. The objects just held the same position.  By now, it was approximately 8:25 a.m. Although none of us were able to continually watch (I, for one, had a noon filing to prepare for the court), one paralegal and I were able to see these objects in their same pattern until at least 8:40.  With the sun changing position, the reflection disappeared, and it was difficult to see the objects anymore.  I cannot say exactly when the objects were no longer there.  By 9 a.m., I could not find them.", "UFO over Long IslandThere was a bright light in the sky. At first I thought it was a jet but realized that it was not moving. I got my video camera and attached it to a tripod and began to video tape with a 360 X zoom lens. What I saw was amazing. It was round and appeared to have the landscape of a planet. There was a green corona around the outer edge of the circle with a black band that went across the circle horizantlly. The obeject also appeared to be pulsating.

The object at its distance would be as bright as a garage flood light about 50 ft away. It seems to stay low to the horizon, and a variably slow straight heading.  This is now the 4th occurence I have had so far.  There are only 2 quirks about this I have noticed.  I am now keeping notes of when i see it and what it does.  Then i noticed tonite, that the moon was out, waxing crescent.  The last time i saw it, the moon was at half phase.  The last thing was that soon after I observe the object, a plane or chopper of some type, appears from the direction of our local airport which is southwest of here.  Once that plane is airborne and climbing, the object begins immediately, almost, move in the opposite direction of the plane, until I lose sight of it in a treeline or building height.  Tonite however, the craft was about a ruler and ahalf away from the first plane following(holding a ruler to the sky), then two more planes or choppers(they had a distinct red light on each) joined in, but the object was too far ahead and they seemed to give up and turn due south.  The object still headed into the west, until i lost it in the treeline.  I happen to catch this object when i step out into my balcony for a smoke.  The last thing which i doubt is possible, i took my office sized(3inch) laser pointer with me the third time i saw this object(early last week) and pointed where i thought wsa directly at the object and it suddenly sped up, moving at a constant distance until it disappeared in the trees once again.  Although when i first see the object its moving away from the same location in the horizon each time, which is in between two towers of sorts with 3 red lights each.  The space between is where i first observed the object last month, and i believe i saw it lift from the ground(horizon at that distance), and continually head west as all the other times.  I am 26 yrs old and originally from New Jersey.  I am in the field of Security and i also do some work from home.  I am a deeply studied person in UFO&apos;s and phenomenon.  I believe i was in sound mind each of the times I have seen this lit object.  The color of the light that this object is would be a pale yello, leaning towards white, and sometimes will seem to pulsate.

I was at summer school for p.e.2 to get ahead. My ex-girlfriend,my friend, and I were walking out into the school courtyard during a lunch break; as alway the p.e. class was given a few minute early before break to clean up and so we snuck out early to the yard. During our walk, I meation how cloudy and moody the sky look and as we look we saw a strange object hovering in the sky.We laugh and joke about the idea of it being an alien space craft but all of us knew for sure it was an u.f.o. and so we didnt dismiss the idea of it being a party plate or a fisbee caught in an updraft. It flew in a strange way. It hover and shake. It was high in the sky, so it couldn&apos;t thrown up. Also, it was a greyish and brownish color. I don&apos;t know what it is but it didn&apos;t seem to care about us or have any signs of intelligence.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Very clear bi-convex disc instantly reverses direction at 15&apos; from observers.While slowly driving east through a residential area in route to a restaurant for a late dinner, my wife (who has a very responsible position in the US space program and is an experienced amateur astronomer who has ground her own telescope mirrors, etc.)and I (thousands of hours experience-in-the-field with sophisticated cameras and electronic instruments tracking anomalous aerial objects and investigating AAO reports)were astonished when a very clear bi-convex disc (about 6&quot; in diameter and about 1.5&quot; thick) with interesting surface details visible, suddenly appeared very low above the wet street (it had been raining and a few drops were still falling, but the air was neither misty nor foggy)and moved across the street traveling at a 90-degree angle from the curb.  The street was wet, but there was no standing or pooled water in the area, no lightening, and very little wind at that time. The object did not appear to be self-luminous (which was probably good, because we could see surface details that could have been concealed by lights) but was very well lighted not only by my car&apos;s headlights but by a street light which was directly above the general area. The bi-convex disc (a color illustration is provided, but it only shows the object edge-on)looked to be made of maybe some hybrid type material that reminded me of nothing so much as tan rock with light gray coloration on the flat top of the disc, which disc also has a flange on both sides, but a flat bottom.  The flange on the top was thicker than that on the bottom. On both the top and bottom flanges, one could see distinct and slightly inset grooves, evenly spaced like approximately 1/8-inch successive layers of a geological substrate, as if the thing were either constructed in layers or else had some kind of coils (one above the other)upon or just beneath the surface! I have pretty effectively illustrated these in the rendering provided, but have not attempted to illustrate the peripheral planes of successive small, dark &apos;dots&apos; that actually looked somewhat recessed, in various planes around the thing.  The reason I have not tried to render those dots in the illustration is because I am not absolutely sure whether those recessed dots were between the recessed peripheral grooves (which are illustrated) or actually within them.  I think the later was the case, but just am not sure,  because it all happened so fast. Anyhow, once the disc (which traveled only about 1/4 to 1/2 inch above the street in a most wonderfully smooth gliding motion resembling an ice hockey puck sliding on ice) came to what may have been the exact middle of the street, and without slowing down (just as the &apos;textbook&apos; UFO), it immediately was suddenly going the same speed in the opposite direction(!), taking it right back across in front of our car (which was stopped or nearly stopped at that point)for a second-chance view. When the bi-convex disc reached the curb (at the same place it had suddenly appeared), it just as suddenly vanished right before our eyes!  So, I accelerated up to the nearby intersection, made a fast U turn, and went back, to see if we could see the thing again, or some trace of it, but nothing was found.  No cars with occupants were seen in the area just before, during, or just after the encounter,  but that is not surprising in that residential neighborhood on a rather rainy night. We heard no sound that we associated with the object.  We felt no electrical sensations or unusual heat or cold, either.  The car engine did not fail, and there was no missing time. The whole thing was so bizarre that we are still in wonderment about the nature of what was observed.  I do not expect to ever figure that one out.  Whatever it was, it just should not have been there. Was it flying?  Well, yes, incredibly smoothly and close to the street.  The thing showed no pitch, yaw, or roll, whatsoever.  It would not be so troubling had we not seen it so very clearly, in good lighting from our headlights and the street lamp. I refuse to believe that the thing was a government spy drone of any type, because I doubt we have technology that sophisticated, or even a spy drone that is disc shaped and only six inches in diameter. I later parked the car in the street and adjusted the position of a white six-inch  ruler laid on the street until it was the same observational elevation above the edge of my car&apos;s hood as the bi-convex disc had been, and the six-inch ruler looked the same angular width as the disc when at 15 feet from the car.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Ray Stanford, a noted UFO investigator, for submitting this report.

Believe the event happened around the second weekend in May, 1966, but I am just now reporting it.  You may verify the event as reported in the Chattanooga Times, approximately the second weekend in May, 1966. Attending a house party (hosted by the Jr. Optimist Club) with a group of high school juniors and seniors from Chattanooga, a group of us were sitting around a campfire in an outdoor clearing, with one girl playing the guitar and others of us sitting around the fire.  Adult chaperones were present.  In the background at a distance of about two to three hundred yards was a ridge; a dense forest in front of that, with a lake.  Looking up at the sky (unable to tell the direction), I noticed two egg shaped objects that appeared to be about the size of a harvest moon appearing just above the ridge, moving from left to right.  One object was slightly above and ahead of the other.  They appeared to be a silvery-white in color.  Both objects skirted the top of the ridge, keeping equi-distant with each other; traveling very fast.  Suddenly, both objects stopped, and made a 45 degree turn to the left and upward, racing up until they vanished out of sight.  Those of us who were facing the ridge were able to track the event in its entirety; the others turned and looked as soon as we shouted &quot;Look at that!&quot;  Needless to say, none of us were able to sleep that night, and talked of the event all night long.  Upon returning to Chattanooga, I noticed that The Chattanooga Times ran a short article in their paper referring to Unidentified Objects spotted near Mentone, Alabama. This event can be confirmed by that newspaper report that appeared in the Sunday edition, I believe, of the Chattanooga Times. Would like a reply, by e-mail, as to exact date of the article in the Times, if possible.  (I have moved away from Chattanoog).((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

I ran into my house and got my binoculars, when I got got back it was maneuvering erratically a little to the north. When I got a good look at it, it was a black triangle with a bright red line accross the back. It was wider than long, like a large hang-glider.  After about 30 seconds it stopped and rotated slowly in place one complete turn then shot off to the east like a bullet.  The sky was mostly clear and blue with a few puffy white clouds.  It looked to me to be as high as commercial air traffic which would have made it about the size of a 747.  I noticed no sound but I could hear a jet at about the same altitude a few seconds later moving in almost the same direction.

I was this in the sky in North Hollywood Ca. This happen during the early 1980&apos;s  In 2001, I lived in La Mesa California and resided in a 2 bedroom apt in a upstairs unit. I remember lying in my bedroom on the bed, and the room was brightly lit. I felt tired, and I asked my live-in boyfriend to go to a nearby taco shop for Mexican food. After he left I dosed off and feel asleep. The next thing know is my boyfriend returns and as he is entering my bedroom, he says very load &quot;wake up! The food is here&quot; as I opened my eyes I saw a gray like creature do a spin and disappear near my bedroom window. The first thought that ran through my mind was that after I feel asleep something was in the room with me. I didn&rsquo;t tell my boyfriend for fear that he would think I was nuts. So, I didn&apos;t a word to anyone about what I had seen. THE NEXT NIGHT: I had been on my computer most of the night. I then told my boyfriend that I was going to bed early, he stopped watching T.V and joined to go to bed. As we got into to bed I turned the lights off, but the room was lit from a light outside attached to the building. So, the bedroom wasn&apos;t completely dark. My boyfriend and I feel asleep after talking for a little while. In the middle of the night I woke up sweating, for some reason I was very hot. I got up from the bed and walked to my right to the corner of the room to wipe my face from sweat with one of the clean towels that I had in a laundry basket on the floor. As leaned down I grabbed the towel and wiped my face, and as I was wiping my face I notice something behind me that seemed to be small quickly run past me I turn to my left and looked to the floor and saw nothing. Then as I laid I dropped the towel, again I saw something moved. I turned to the right side of myself and looked toward the floor and saw nothing, and just as though I am seeing things. I notice something behind me to the left side. I quickly turn and looked and saw this small creature hovelling down to the floor. It had lizard type skin; it was mixed of colors of Black, dark green, dark gray. The little creature stood up and stretched his arms that had attached skin that appeared to be broken wings. The eyes were black and the feet looked liked hoof of a pig or horse. When the little creature aroused up it stood about 8 ft. tall, and it moved in a slow jerking move jerking manner. It stepped across the bed in one step, while it was stepped across the bed boyfriend woke up and tried to yell there was no sound he was only moving in the bed in fear. After the little creature stepped across the bed it turn toward me backing up it&apos;s back up away from the bed then it stopped with it&apos;s arm and body in a hunch, and sat still. I look at it and wonder how it be so small again, boyfriend was trying to turn on the bedroom light and hear him asking me &quot;what the HELL is that thing?&quot; I was speechless and never said a word because the small creature was still in the room looking straight through me. I look down at toward the floor to wonder where its long legs had gone. I notice that was another creature sitting next to it with its head hunched down to fit in the room. This creature was enormous in size. It had I long face with black eyes, it sat like a dog sitting straight up. I notice that it had two horns attached to its head that went straight back, it had the same colors as the little creature, but the feet were different. I so afraid because it was so BIG! That is when began to shake all over. Suddenly, I though about all of the people that said they were abducted and not believed. Then suddenly in a (psychic way) for a quick moment I saw a far away planet, where many humans were and not returned to earth. I was these many of the same type of creatures in a militant stance. They seemed to be angry, and then it all went away. I saw the two creatures standing in the room again. I thought of my children, and thought that I would never see them again. Suddenly I hear the large creature say with an angry tone &quot;LOOK AT THOSE HUMANS&quot;, that&apos;s is when I quickly jump onto the bed and buried my head into the blankets and began praying, I quickly yelled TURN ON THE LIGHT! I don&apos;t why I said that. My boyfriend said I&apos;m trying, I&apos;m trying it won&apos;t come on. Then suddenly the light comes on, and I jumped toward him, and we look at the direction of the creatures and they were gone. All of this seemed like it took place in 5 mins but it was really hours, because I ran out of the room to called my family and noticed the time and it was almost 5:00AM in the morning. I don&apos;t think that I have ever been that scared in my life. To this day I wonder if anyone else had seen anything like that. I have looked on the Internet and have never come across an event like my boyfriend&rsquo;s and mine.

However, the one that caught our attention was the one that was moving. At first, we thought it might be a plane. But then I realized that was imposible because it went from one end of the sky to the other in a matter of about 8 or 9 seconds then would come to a dead stop, change directions and traverse the sky again. The star seemed to be moving as if it were connecting dots, like in a coloring book. We noticed it first near the northwest horizon, then moving in a straight line it traveled directly above us and ended over in the Southeast, then it stopped and started again moving West, then it connected dots mainly overhead after that which made us wander if somehow it knew we were watching it.

I was driving westbound on M-14, an expressway in Southeastern Michigan. I have driven this expressway for the last 20 years (I am a serial commuter) and I know it like the back of my hand. It was dark out and as I rounded a corner I noticed a large, bright object just over the trees up ahead of me. As I got closer, I noticed that the light came from three large circles with a flashing orange circle in the middle. They were in a triangular pattern. The light was an extremely white, very intense light. I was the only car on the westbound side of the expressway so I slowed way down to around 10-15 mph, almost to a stop.The object was about 200 feet in the air, just past the Gotfredson Road exit (going westbound), on the south side and about 50 yards off the expressway. At first I couldn&rsquo;t see the structure that the circles of light were attached to but as I got closer and was more directly under it, I noticed that the lights were attached to a triangular shaped object. The only way I saw the structure was because it was slightly darker than the night sky. It had some depth but probably wasn&rsquo;t more than 30 feet deep. I thought it was odd that the lights did not throw any reflection up to the structure. The lights had no reflective properties at all. Even the ground below was not lit up by any light. With as bright as these lights were and how close it was to the ground, I couldn&rsquo;t understand why nothing was lit up.This thing was large. It was the size of a 747 or so, if a 747 could be triangular. The ends of the triangle were blunted, they were not sharp. The object made no noise. This particular section of the expressway has no development and is surrounded by crop fields and stands of woods. There is no lighting or large buildings. When I slowed down to a crawl, I noticed that this thing was staying stock-still and was making no noise. None. I watched the object for about two more minutes. It never moved. The only motion was the orange light blinking in the middle of the three white lights.", "Small flying &quot;metal Death Stars&quot;I was 12years old Flying on a PSA DC10. I was flying from Fresno to LA, I know it wasn&apos;t a dream  because I never sleep on flights. I&apos;m scared to fly, we were descending into Los Angeles When I noticed outside my window (near the Wing!) two metallic Balls. The 1st object was 20 times bigger then the other one, it was the size of a one car garage. The tiny one was as big as a medicine ball. It circled the big one like the rings of Saturn. They both moved in sink, they were going as fast as the airplane and at the same time seem to swivel in miniature circles (perfectly in sync).I gazed into the big one, it seem to gaze right back at me, it looked like the &quot;Death Star&quot; from Star Wars. It had a electronic boards imbedded in it&apos;s texture and it had a few lights, I think I remember both of them having tiny antennas. These objects seemed to be checking out the plane, the pilot had to of noticed. The Beverly Hills YMCA had reserved the airplane for Summer camp that year. We had just ended our trip to the Sierra Mountains. The plane was packed with little kids and a couple of staff. Everyone had been sleeping on the plane accept me and a 6year old next to me. I yelled to a counselor after I caught my breath, he was pissed because I had woke him. He yelled &quot;what now?&quot; Your going to get it. As he came down the isle he kept grumbling, I stared out the window, the UFO kept spinning very fast as the tiny one orbited it. He bent down to look while he stood over me. On my right was the UFO and on my left was the counselor, I watched is eye&apos;s start to meet with the window. I looked quick to my right, as the objects started to rip away faster then two blinks of an eye, they were gone and he was not convinced. I got in trouble that week for lying.

I saw it at 11:30 am. Over a time span of about 90 minutes, the object was witnessed by at least 30 people, including campus police officers, police cadets, teachers, staff and students of East Los Angeles College. One witness is a MUFON member. He told me to note that the oject was 265 degrees west. I would estimate the object&apos;s angular distance above the western horizon at 80 degrees. The object was seen through a single lens spy glass and through binoculars. My impression was that the object was a flat oval shape, reflective with a black coloration at the bottom that I took to be a shadow. It was parallel to the horizon, not moving. I phoned in a report to NUFORC at around 11:45 am. Shortly after, a second object was witnessed by about 10 people, including the police officers. The second object approached the first one, stopped, moved around a bit then &quot; took off &quot;. One witness said the second object disappeared.Campus police returned at around 1:15 pm and found the object again. About 6 people, including myself, looked at the object again through binoculars. This time the the object appeared tear-drop shaped, white and at a 90 degree angle to the horizon. It&apos;s angular distance above the western horizon had decreased to about 50 degrees. I took a digital picture in which a tiny white dot can be seen when you zoom in. My co-worker who had the original sighting starting at 8:45 am, and who found the object again at 11:30 am, returned that evening and located the object a third time at around 7:30 pm. Now the object was about 50 degrees above the eastern horizon! I took several digital pictures. The object appears as a tiny white dot. It seemed to slowly drift north. My co-worker will follow up with a report about what he witnessed between 8:45 am and 9:30 am, which was even more bizarre than the group sighting!", "Large Cigar shaped object very close.This is my 3rd report on this site. I seem to be one of those people who are fortunate (or maybe unfortunate?) to see these objects. I am not sure of the exact date, but my best guess is around March 1980. At that time I worked 2nd shift at a small shop in New Milford, Ct., but lived in Waterbury, Ct., maybe 30 miles away. I was driving home from work on Interstate 84 around 12:30 A.M.. It was a beautiful night. There was a very bright full moon, and it was perfectly clear. I had just passed though Southbury Ct.. There is a large hill as you come to the exit for Oxford, Ct. From this hill you can see Waterbury in the distance maybe 5-6 miles away.I was driving east, and I was coming down this hill. I looked to my left over the 4 lane highway. Just above the treeline on the other side of the highway I saw what you would first believe to be a blimp. This object was dark against the bright sky and I could see it clearly. It looked to be almost 100 feet long, and 15 feet high. It had no undercarriage of any kind, nor wings, or vertical/horizontal stabilizers as blimps usually have. It was round on each end. It really did not look like a blimp. It was too long and narrow. Most blimps I have ever seen are much fatter than this object was. It was maybe 150 feet to my left, and was flying VERY LOW. It did not look to be more than 30 feet above the trees that lined the highway. So it was maybe 60-75 feet above the ground. This object was going east just like me, but slightly faster. I was probably going 65 MPH, I estimate the object to be travelling at around 80 MPH. The first thing I did was roll down my window to see if I could hear it, but all I could hear was the wind blowing past my car. I left the window down so I could get a good look at it. Fortunately, there was no traffic at all, so I was able to take a pretty good look. What looked extremely strange and shocking about this object is that it had 3 large, perfectly round port-holes on it&apos;s underside. They looked exactly like the port-holes on a ship. They were windows. I could see inside this object. A blue light shined out of each port-hole downward into the trees. All I could see inside this object was blue light, but I am positive I could see into this object. Then, as the object gained on me, I could see another perfectly round port-hole on it&apos;s rear end. I could also see inside this window. But this port-hole was different. A green light shined out of this port-hole and out behind it. I was looking into this port-hole. But all I could see was green light inside the object. None of the lights were difficult to look at. Now, the object was starting to get pretty far ahead of me. Then it did something that amazed me. At the bottom of this long hill the highway curves sharply to the left (north). When this object came to the curve it made a smooth left turn. It was following the highway! That was a very strange thing to see. By now I was getting to the bottom of the hill myself and the object was getting pretty far away. I lost it in the glow coming up from Waterbury. There is one more thing I want to say. I know many people mistake common objects for UFO&apos;s. But I have thought about this object for many years, and do not believe I am mistaken. The ONLY object this remotely resembled would be a blimp. But I am sure it was not for several reasons. 1) It did not look like a blimp. I could see it clearly. It had no undercarriage for pilots, nor any wings, vertical or horizontal of any type. 2) It was quiet. I have seen the Goodyear Blimp and other blimps many times. They are quite loud. You can usually hear them many miles away. Even though I was driving, this object was so close I should have been able to hear it clearly. 3) It was too low. I cannot imagine anyone flying any aircraft just above the trees like this. Even if the military had some secret aircraft, I sincerely doubt they would fly it at such a dangerously low altitude. 4) It followed the highway. I guess an aircraft could follow a highway, but I can&apos;t imagine why. I made a picture of this object on my computer using Paint. I am not an artist, the colors are not right at all, but it will give you the idea. It was a pretty easy object to draw. You are welcome to use it if you wish, but please do not disclose my name or e-mail. Here is the link for my drawing:  http://imagebay.org/users/800/21727.bmp((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "A sudden extraordinary occurance in the sky...seeing at near range a ufo...traveling fast, low, horizontal as a ball and streak.I live in Lake Zurich IL about 15-20 miles north of O&apos;Hare Airport. The area also has several smaller airports. Given this location there are always planes in the sky...of varying size, propulsion, direction, height, color etc.  I have a Lab (dog) and walk him 4 times a day.  Our last walk of the day is between 10PM and 12PM.  While the dog takes himself for a walk, typically I check out the night sky...stars, falling/shooting stars, low flying and high flying planes.  I claim no particular knowledge or skill,  in making observations of atmospheric or man made airial objects.At about (I wasn&apos;t wearing a watch) 11:15PM...I was standing still just doing what I normally do...checking the position of the Big Dipper...noticing some distant moving lights in the sky, which always turn out to be aircraft lights. The sky was clear...visability very good. Having set the background, I was totally relaxed, and just observing the sky when a bright white light flashed across the sky in front of me. There was, by my judgment, a white...ball...that left a streak. It took that object one maybe two seconds to pass through my field of vision.  I had no time to turn my head..my eyes seemed to pick up a moving light not much before it was just to the right of the direction I was looking. My eyes just followed the white ball/streak till trees cut off my line of sight.  I just stood there, amazed, thinking (and still thinking)- what the hell did I see? And there was no sound that I could hear.Here are descriptive facts as my mind recorded them:  1) This ball and streak was traveling HORIZONTAL to the ground, moving north to south (direction of O Hare Airport), at a speed that I (former accountant) calculate very crudely (I&apos;m just trying to get a ball park idea of speed)...at a speed of 18,000 mph.2)Now the following is very difficult, because obviously I was not at all prepared for a special observation, and its longevity was very,very brief. I tried to guess at the height and distance it was from me.  Again, I am very familiar with aircraft flying at various altitudes and distances.  Nevertheless,this observation was difficult to nail down.  The altitude was low...and I  am perfectly aware of spacial illusions...and because of the size of the object and speed...all making me question each of my own conclusions.  I feel the object was surely under 5,000 feet, possibly under 1,000 feet and ...somewhere in that range.  And it did not seem very far away...here, as a very rough guess, I would say it was about 5- 10 miles away...just as a crude guess.3)  This bright white ball ( as near as I can tell) left a streak or tail that went back about 2-3 miles...but of course, if I&apos;m off in height and distance then my sense of distance for this streak would be distorted.In summary, this occurance was like seeing a shooting star, traveling low and horizontally, at an incredible speed.((ADDENDUM REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS))This is a supplemental report and inquiry.In my report filed yesterday 8/10/04 I failed to state the size of the UFO.My guesstimate would be -  about 10 feet.  Otherwise in reading case histories on this site I was shocked to note that many cases  involved circumstances much like I experienced.I have a few questions:  1)  For a very crude calculation of speed (i.e. how fast is &quot;fast&quot;?) I made a simple (and I know it&apos;s simple, really). Using my best judgment I estimated the distance that I saw the UFO cover at 5 miles (I had trees to my left and right...so my field of vison was narrowed). My estimate of duration was one to two seconds (and though it was a blink) it could have even been three seconds...but lets go with one second. So for this calculation the object was going 5 miles a second, then multiplying 5 miles times 60 seconds...we get 300 miles per minute, which is then multiplied by 60 minutes to the hour...and we&apos;re up to 18,000 mph.  Remember, this is a crude calculation (strictly to determine a &quot;ball park guess&quot;.  Now, if my sight duration was 2 seconds that would cut the guesstimated speed to 9,000 mph...3 seconds would bring the speed down to 6,000 mph.  This calculation alone is not enough.  If we had several such calculations, we might be able to draw some fairly good conclusions.  But by this conclusion I &quot;m pretty confident this object was going many times the speed of todays aircraft.2) After filing my initial form on this site, I called the FAA.  The man I spoke to was responsible for taking UFO sightings.  He was nice enough, but he questioned me like I was an pilot returning from a mission.  After all, I had a 1 -2 second experience that happened because I was casually looking at a small piece of the night sky.  Again, he was nice but he had edge of skepticism that I tolerated (after all under similar circumstances I might act the same ).  Toward the end of the conversation he asked if I ever saw a meteor?  I have seen many  a shooting star or falling star and I might have seen a meteor shower years ago.  I said that I don&apos;t think it was a meteor...and besides this object was going at a fast, constant speed, horizontally - parallel to the ground.  His answer was...just as you can point a gun in any direction...a meteor can go in any direction (...???).  I said I didn&apos;t know that. At this moment I don&apos;t believe that bit of information...I&apos;ll check it out.  Before ending the call, he was nice enough to tell me there was a sighting a half hour earlier in California.  And it was  possible one object could have been in both places that night.  3)Again, taking crude and possible numbers...30 minutes into 2100 miles equals 70 miles per minute...times 60 minutes...and that says  on a direct flight from LA to Chicago in 30 minutes the object was going 4,200 mph. Of course, the object might have gone to several places only to end up in Chicago.  If that were the case the calculation would be wrong and the speed much faster.  Anyway, based on what we have we know there is a possibility the object is doing it&apos;s traveling over the US at a speed of ...between 4,200 mph and 6,000 mph (or 9,000 mph, or 18,000 mph ). 4) FINALLY,  as already explained in the original submission, I&apos;m within the O&apos;Hare radar reach...is it possible to inquire of the FAA if the O&apos;Hare radar picked up a UFO on Monday night around 11:15pm? And if they would...would they tell the truth? Would an object streaking at a fantastic speed even show up...and if it did would they conclude it was just a &quot;bug&quot;?

I went back  to the building and again I changed my mind ,I was so young and who would beleive me  if by the time we got back there it would be gone.So I turned around and went back to the spot and watched the object, it was still there. I continued to look around for anyone to appear ,no one did and I finally left and went home.I got home about 15 min. later and woke my dad and told him what happened .He asked me if anyone else was around, I said no, so he said go to bed and forget it, no one would beleive me anyway.My father died in 1988 and he was right,no one ever has believed me.I have never since seen another craft like it.", "flying saucer hovering between trees in my backyard above the power line (recharging, perhaps?)I turn off my TV, FINALLY, and I&apos;m about to go to sleep, pulling up my blankets. And I see a bright light between these two trees. And I&apos;m like &quot;yeah whatever, an airplane.&quot; and then it stays in that SAME spot, and I&apos;m like..hmm..what is that. so I search in the dark for my glasses, and finally find them, and I put them on, and look back over, and it&apos;s still there. and I see little lights as well, and I thought well maybe it&apos;s just a glare. but then I see how clear they are. and okay, so there was one bigger and brighter light, and in a circle, there were little lights. So I jump up, whispering &quot;OH MY GOD! A FUCKING UFO!&quot; to myself. and I grab my camera, and by the time I turn it on and get it on the right setting, it&apos;s moved too far. but oh my gosh. I swear it was a UFO. and HOLY MOLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "We witnessed a red light that changed to a white light and then disappeared.Friday night July 2 we were on patrol for the citizen&apos;s patrol and about 11.30 pm we thought we saw a forest fire on top of the mountain on the north side of Sicamous. We drove around the block a few times to get our directions correct before we phoned it in. Then what we thought was a forest fire  turned into a very bright white light ,then it turned back to a red light that looked like a forest fire and then back again to a bright white light then lifted up into the sky and disappeared. Maggie Sproat", "Me and my uncle were gazing at planets and stars through his telescope. We decided to take a little break and just gaze at the stars for a moment. It was a good idea because we saw a couple of shooting stars. About 3 minutes later i noticed an extremely faint light around where i saw a falling star just moments ago. It was odd because it appeared to be extremely farther away farther than a satellite we just saw go bye. So we knew it couldnt be a satellite. It would flash rapidly and stop for 5-10 seconds then reappear. For the first 30 seconds i was watching it, it was stationary. Then it began to move at a pretty rapid speed across the sky. It made its way half way across the sky then and made a almost a complete u-turn and darted off in the other direction. That night it was crystal clear, clearer than it has been in a long while. And where he lives the is no light polution what so ever. We gaze at stars on a constant basis, but this is the first time we saw anything of the sort. It was a very dim flashing white light moving quitely, eratically, and misteriously across the sky. The funny part is, we saw no more shooting stars after that. The light the object emitted waz very faint and hazy to see", "I saw a light towards me that suddenly went the opposite direction, and fast. A plane would have had to turn aroundI was outside on our balcany watching the sunset. We live high up so we can see the lights of vancouver, and then I see a light sort of looked like a star really far to the north-east of Vancouver, and I see this light and I figured it was a plane, but it didint seem to be moving. When you look at a plane you see a blinking light, but this didint have any blinking lights. I knew it was facing me by the way the lights were but suddenly it goes through clouds that are directly behind it. A plane would have had to circle around so within one second I can see it again after it came out of the cloud and it was going faster then any plane ive ever seen it was hard to say what shape it was but if I had to guess I would say Teardrop. It was dark colored", "We were at Tullamarine airport in Melbourne waiting for a relatives flight from Queensland to arrive. I was filming aircraft taking off and landing with the kids. I was filming one aircraft taking off but lost track of it in viewfinder. I then noticed this circle light in top right of screen. It seemed to illuminate into a saucer shape and had 4 short beams coming from underneath it like a jet engine. My wife says it is probably the reflection of the lights of the window, but Im not so sure. I currently have video on miniDV tape so will need to convert to mpeg and send to you in due coursed.", "Zig-zagging star(?) over Seattle.At approximately 0045 this AM, while taking a break from my patrol duties, I looked up and noticed, what I thought was a bright star... moving. Continuing to watch, I braced myself against my patrol car to get a more stable point of perspective. The object had the brightness of a larger, bright star, when compared to the other stars that were visible, and, using other stars for points of reference, it was, ever-so-slightly zig-zagging, or tumbling as it headed toward the north-northwest. As it jogged about, its brightness remained constant. I watched until it went behind the clouds that were moving in over Seattle. There were no other lights that I could see on the object, and no con-trail. This thing must have been at or above the normal flight altitude that I regularly see airplanes at, and covered about thirty degrees of arc from the time I first noticed it until it went behind the clouds. No aircraft were in the area, which I thought was unusual as well.", "Round Reflective Object Veiwed in Rocklin, CA at Approx. 6:10pm on August 22On Sunday August 22 at approximately 6:10pm, 3 others and myself were sitting outside on my balcony. I was sitting facing northeast and as always, I searched the skies for anomalies. I noticed an object at approximately 60 degrees above the horizon. The object appeared to be circular and reflective. As I was watching the object, I was trying to figure out if it was a balloon or perhaps a star. I pointed the object out to the 3 other people I was with (we all adults late 30&rsquo;s to early 40&rsquo;s) and 2 out of the 3 others were able to see it. As I was watching this object for a 4-5 minute period, I also noticed another fainter object the right at about 30 degrees higher. The 2 others and myself were discussing what might this be (alternating looking at each other and back at the object) when out of my left peripheral vision I saw a reflective object move by at an accelerated speed. When I looked up to where I originally saw the object, the object was gone, as well as the fainter object. I am not sure if what I saw was the object itself moving swiftly by, or if it was something else like a translucent insect reflecting the sun light high up in the sky (I didn&rsquo;t get a good feel on the actual altitude)?  I am just wondering if anyone else saw this object and I will keep checking back to see if anyone else reports anything.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "Traveling along a main road on Ft Lewis I noticed from the north a air craft was traveling just above ground level about a half mile away.  The object picked up speed and seemed to gain altitude gradually flying east to west.  It continued to gain altitude and then banked south and flew off in the distance.  This all took place over about 3min.  The object did have blinking 3 blinking lights on it and it did make a steady rumbling sound.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "I was looking at the night sky and noticed a few stars dissapear then reappear. At first I thought it was a little strange and almost as soon as I finished the thought I noticed a black shape (Triangular) moving through the sky. The sky was clear of clouds that night so that is why I didn&apos;t see this object at first, plus the fact that the object seemed to make no noise. At first I wasn&apos;t really comprehending what I was seeing. As soon as I realized what it was I froze. I wanted to go get one of my other family members but for some reason I was unable to do anything more then to stare at it as it fly slowly overhead at about 700 to 1,000 ft. The  strangest thing about the object was that it was moving so slowly. If I had to guess the object&apos;s speed, I&apos;d say it was moving at about 50 to 75 mph(North to South). It was so black that if I hadn&apos;t noticed the stars dissapearing and reappearing then I probably would of never of noticed it. One more thing. This might sound stupid but the object appeared to have a circular window on the bottom side of it with light coming out of it.I didn&apos;t observe any type of activity in the window(if that was in fact a window and that was the bottom side of the object).Maybe it was a light on the bottom but it didn&apos;t seem to be.Until that night I never really believed if unexplained flying objects and while my knowledge may be limited in the area of terrestial flying objects I am sure that what I witnessed that night was an object that I can&apos;t explained and my thoughts sometimes go back to that night. I also believe that I witnessed see the same object one more time in march of 1998 after I returned to my home in Long Beach, Ca that event was so fast that it lasted less then 10 seconds. I caught a glimpse of it between some buildings when an object passed between the moon and me casting a shadow on me.I looked up because I didn&apos;t hear the helicopter that the police use flying over hear and there it was again.I have never seen the object again. I also cannot explain why I froze in place the first time I saw the object.All my senses were screaming at me to go get someone but I just stood there in utter amazment and shock. Go figure.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Immediately noticed an orange ball of light in the southeast night sky.  Wondered out loud &quot;What&apos;s that&quot;.  Two of us watch for about 5 seconds and ask eachother &quot;Is it bouncing&quot;.  We both look away and blink.  We look back to determine the following: 1.Based on my estimation of height and distance (not sure what these measurements would be, but it&apos;s low and not very far away), the object looks to be about the size of a large SUV or van.  2.If there was a sound to be heard, the conditions were perfect; clear skies, no wind, very calm.  However, we heard nothing.  3.It&apos;s moving from east to west.  4.Strangest of all, it appears to be &quot;bouncing&quot;.  That is, moving up and down with short, quick movements while horizontal speed is slow to stop. Speed changes are eratic. Almost seems like we&apos;re watching a living creature.  After about 1 minute, I removed the window screen and climbed out onto the garage roof for the best possible view.  Watched object continue west (again, bouncing with variable rate of speed) for another 2 minutes until it became obscured by neighborhood trees.  I&apos;ll add here that I am an avid sky watcher and am quite familiar with aircraft types and air traffic patterns.  This one just didn&apos;t match up with anything I&apos;d seen before.", "Two Bright Objects above San Antonio, Texas.After listening to COASTTOCOASTAM, I went to get a shower and after taking my shower I headed to bed.  I have a routine of looking out my window when I go to bed and this time as I look outside into the eastern sky, I notice a bright light?  At first I thought it was the moon?  But I looked to my right at a southeastern direction and there was the moon.  Then I thought it was a star and as I was about to look away I saw a small ariel vehicle approach this bright light in the sky from the north and it position it&apos;s self to the right of this bright object?  The small ariel vehicle did not have that blinking red light that most heliocopter or airplanes have under it&apos;s belly.  This smaller ariel vehicle had a pulsing motion to it?  After viewing the video tape of what I saw early this morning till the sun started coming up, I saw that this bright image had a dark middle area with multiple rings moving out from it&apos;s center?  At the time, I was seeing this I was having a severe headache from a strange humming sound in my ears that was louder then normal?  I have contacted some of the local news stations to ask if anyone reported this sighting in the A.M. hours and only one station NEWS4 KMOL said that there were a few reports.  I told them that I recorded this sighting and all the news stations want my recording but I told them that I will give them an answer later.  I believe I started seeing this object about 5:00 A.M. but did not start filming till 5:30 and my camcorder shows an ending time of 6:20 A.M. but I stop filming because the sun was coming up and I was very tired and wanted to get some sleep.  But the object was still there as the sun started coming up but the best view was against a dark sky.", "Bright light moving and fading to dark, like high altitude rocket thruster, seen briefly near Cassiopea.While stargazing on said night with friend, friend went inside for few minutes.  We had been gazing at Casseopia, and a light in that direction caught my eye.  A few degrees SW of the &quot;center&quot; of Casseopia, it had not been there moments before.  It was a little brighter than Mars had been at its closest approach to Earth, but white.  Startled to see a &quot;planet&quot; where one shouldn&apos;t be, I observed the light begin to slowly fade after 4 or 5 seconds, making me wonder if I had happened to observe a nova.  I desperately wanted my friend to get back out there!  The light then began to make a slow arc of a few degrees, counter-clockwise, continuing to fade until it stopped moving/faded from view after about 10 seconds.  Maybe terrestrial, but sure looked like a high altitude rocket thrust...any reports of U.S. tests?", "Bizarre omega-shaped tube of vapor, four degrees high (4 moons), while blue and white helicopter circlesHi Peter,  It was nice talking to you earlier, despite the necessary haste because of your impending trip to Denver, etc. Don&apos;t you think maybe the potentially leading term &quot;craft&quot; should be left out of your reporting form?  What my wife and I saw this morning was something other than a &quot;craft&quot;, I suspect, yet it was quite bizarre.  It involved a &apos;something&apos; shaped exactly like a vertically oriented Greek letter omega, complete with the small &apos;wing&apos; out to each side at the bottom.  The &apos;thing&apos; seemed composed of a very solid-looking tube with pointed ends that was of a bright white, opaque-looking, and highly coherent &apos;vapor&apos; (or something else). It subtended about four full moons or two degrees in height (somewhat less in width), as measured objectively by my wife using fingers at arm&apos;s length, and by me, independently. The Omega-like thing hovered at about 42 degrees elevation in our north-northwestern sky while a brand-new-looking (very clean, bright paint) blue and white helicopter circled several times between us and it at only a couple of hundred feet (maybe 300-400 maximum) just to the east and southeast of the &apos;thing&apos;, until the thing suddenly began to disintegrate or dissolve as a white vapor that was quickly carried away to the east on low-level winds that were the same as at ground level. Then, the helicopter flew off. It was the extraordinarily noise of the low-level, circling (in a N-S oval) helicopter (that had just flown into the area) that caused my wife and me to look up in its direction and, as a result, see the bizarre omega-shaped thing hovering what seemed, subjectively, no more that a thousand feet to the northwest of the elliptical path of the helicopter. The helicopter departed once the &apos;omega&apos; began to disintegrate, after having completed several traverses of its elliptical path. I have subsequently learned the identity of the helicopter and the name of its pilot, plus the phone number were I should be able to reach him early in the morning (Saturday). Anything I learn from the pilot will be relayed to you. I would stress that this definitely was not a jet aircraft&apos;s condensation wake, nor was it an ordinary low-level cloud, by any stretch of the imagination.  Whatever it might have been, it gave the impression of being of artificial, and at least to us, anomalous in origin. We live just inside the northern edge of the Washington, D.C. Beltway (I 495), and a short drive west of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland. I ran inside to get the camera but could not locate it, so I ran back out while my wife (who had watched in the interim of my absence)went in and found the camera and came back outside with it.  By that time, the object had disintegrated, with the residue drifting east.  I took several photos of the vapor drifting east along with small clouds and trees for reference, in order to show that the residue was drifting on the lower-level wind and not with the atmosphere higher up where jets fly. The observation was not frightening, but it seemed quite bizarre, that impression enhanced by the elliptically circling helicopter just to the omega&apos;s east and southeast, and only while the object was there.  It will be interesting to learn whether the pilot saw the phenomenon, and I have learned the pilot was &quot;on a photo mission&quot;, so he might even have gotten photos.  I shall not hold my breath, though, because the pilot and anyone else aboard may have been distracted downward because it was a photo mission. If not the observed phenomenon, I wonder what they were trying to photograph in that area.  The photo objective may have been something prosaic, however, although I can&apos;t help but hope they saw the phenomenon and took photos. Within six minutes after the observation, I checked the ELF magnetic environment with one of our instruments, but found nothing magnetically anomalous in the monitored range. I would judge, subjectively, that the vertically oriented (at least from our view, and seemingly relative to the ground) &apos;omega&apos; was located approximately over the intersection of the northern side of the D.C. Beltway (I 495) with I 95, going north and south toward and from Baltimore. It was so windy this morning that I am confident the &apos;omega&apos; was not &apos;skywriting&apos;, and, furthermore, being just north of D.C. within its beltway, we are in a highly FLIGHT CONTROLLED zone. A skywriting aircraft would have been attacked by the Air Force, immediately.  Furthermore, sky writing would not have hovered in the sky, as did this phenomenon before its &apos;disintegration&apos;. I hope no one tries to read anything into the fact that the phenomenon was omega-shaped, even though I could think of some political commentary.  :)", "Spinning dome shaped object hovering in sky with red tint &amp;pulsing white light.ME AND MY ROOMMATE OBSERVED A DOME SHAPED OBJECT HOVERING IN THE SKY, IT MADE NO SOUND AND HAD A RED TONE OF COLOR TO IT. IT ALSO HAD A WHITE PULSATING LIGHT EMANATING FROM IT. IT WAS SPINNING RAPIDLY YET IT WASN&apos;T MOVING MUCH,AFTER ABOUT TEN MINUTES IT SLOWLY BEGAN MOVING AWAY FROM US. DURING THIS TIME WE NOTICED AIRCRAFT SCRAMBLING FROM THE LEMOORE NAVAL BASE TOWARDS THE OBJECT. WITHIN THE NEXT TEN MINUTES WE LOST SIGHT OF IT.", "On the morning of september 11, 2001 I seen a huge bright light. It looked like a light from a jet plane. The light appeared over the Ocean north, north-east and was very low over the water. There were no other boats or planes in the area that I could see, but it was still dark at this time in the morning. I immediately got a bad feeling about the light when it did not move like an aircraft it hovered over the ocean. I wanted to think it was a hellicopter, but the light was so big, so bright and low to the water. I have seen several hellicopters from the medical flight copters, life guard, coast guard to some aircraft choppers that come out of Jacksonville Navy base, and this was like none I had ever seen. I know there is a military copter that can hover but it has a forceful airflow beneath it and it makes a great deal of noise. I believe if it was that type of aircraft, I could of heard the sound or seen water being forced up from the ocean, but it did neither. When I made a turn off A1A onto state road 100 (going west) the light moved over the ocean to the side of my car just above the tree line and stayed directly to the side of my car past I-95 through the city of Bunnell about ten miles from where I turned off A1A. In Bunnell state road 100 turns to the north north-west and when I made this turn it again aligned up with the right side of my car, and fallowed me again. I lost sight of it behind some trees about 3 miles after the turn. Given the events of that day I did nothing to follow up on it. But, about three weeks later while driving home I heard the Rush Limbaugh show and he mentioned seeing a huge bright light in the sky about 1/2 hour after I first seen the light. He, I believe, lives about 6 hours by car south of where I live. I wrote into his show, but never got a reply. And, until I found the UFO reporting center, I never mentioned it to anyone else, but would love to know what it was I saw and if anyone else seen the same light.", "A bright light hovering in the sky, closes into itself, then takes off at an incredible speed.I live in an area less than a mile from the old Dow Air Force Base, the site now houses Bangor International Airport. It was at night, in a little patch of woods known as Brown Woods Trail. My boyfriend and myself were in the woods, no flashlights, just darkness, when we came to a clearing. Coming over the treetops and moving towards us was a bright light. We thought it must be a helicopter as we are less than a mile from the airport. The light just hovered there, making no noise what so ever. As soon as I pointed at it and mentioned it being there, the light seemed to close into itself until it was just a pinpoint of light and then took off straight up at an incredible speed. I don&apos;t believe we have the kind of technology it would require to travel at such speeds.  Two months previously, in the same general area I experienced the exact same thing.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "bright light in eastern sky above treelineEarly this morning (3:33 exactly) I witnessed a very bright light in the sky. I was looking out of a window in our house which looks out onto the eastern/south-eastern portion of sky, because I had noticed an unusually bright light in the sky through the blinds. My first thought was that it was an airplane heading in our direction, as we do experience airplanes and helicopters flying over and over this section of sky on a frequent basis, but this light did not seem to move from it&apos;s position at all. I would say it was similar to seeing Venus at it&apos;s brightest from our home in Colorado recently, only in the East, instead of the West, and much brighter and definitely bigger. It was just above the line of trees which grow a couple of houses away.I know the exact time, because I was awakened out of a peaceful sleep by a very loud, sudden impact noise (like the sound of a stomp on the roof, or a big door slamming closed) and immediately heard a low-flying airplane approaching, it zoomed directly past our southern facing bedroom window, low enough that I could see it&apos;s lights, going from the west to the east. I looked at the clock and it read 3:33. this is when I went into the ajoining room, sat down in a chair at our computer, and witnessed the light through the window. I was up for little more than a half-hour, all the while keeping a loose eye on this light, which in all this time, never moved from it&apos;s position. Just before going back to bed, I looked out of the eastern-facing window once more, and noticed for the first time that the light was flashing, or twinkling somewhat like a star would do, but this object was much larger than any star I&apos;ve ever seen in the sky! In fact, I have never seen anything like this before at all. Around 4:00 I retucked the kids into bed, and went to my own bedroom. Out of curiosity, before lying down myself, I looked out the southern-facing window of our bedroom, to see if I could spot this light, and I just barely could. It was as bright as ever, and still seemed to be in the same position. I have no clue as to how long it had been there before I saw it, or how long it stayed after I went to bed, but I did not sleep well after that.This morning, it was all I could think about, so I immediately got online, and have searched for a couple hours for anything showing the star/planet configuration for last night and today, with no luck. finally I decided to come here, and see if anyone else has reported seeing anything similar. I am sure others must have seen the same object. Perhaps it was something easily explained. My ear will be glued to Coast to Coast tonight, though, in the hopes of hearing someone else&apos;s report.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object the witnesses were looking may have been Venus.

It appeared almost overhead, but shifted about 60 to 70 degrees above the western horizon, low enough to be easily seen.  As an object it seemed a bit large, or a bit close, say 1000 to 3000 feet altitude, and made no noise. The object did not seem to rotate much about its own axis.  Visually, it had a squarish, or four lobed appearance, like a diamond shape, with a larger sphere in the middle.  This was evident when it was at its closest, when I first glanced up and saw it.  It was startlingly large.  I observed it for nearly 5 minutes from overhead to losing it behind a house roof. Two pictures are either attached or sent separately by email, Pict5704.jpg (optical zoom 10x) and Pict5708.jpg (4x additional digital zoom, 40x total).

Although it had occurred some 20 years ago I feel it is significant enough to mention.  He stated that while he was in a rooming house he got to know a man there that always seemed to be disturbed about something.  He also appeared to show a great deal of anxiety. One day while my friend and the man were talking the man admitted that there was a time in his life when he was normal as any other average person.  It all changed one day while he was hunting in the Watchung Mountains region.  While he was in the woods he encountered a creature that he described as being &quot;not from this world&quot;.  It frightened him significantly.  He yelled at the creature to leave.  When the creature did not he tried to shoot at it with his gun.  However, the gun jammed.  This terrified him even more.  The man became upset during this part of the conversation and did not want to talk about the experience anymore. Since much time had passed my friend has lost contact with the man.I have known my friend for some time and do know him well.  I have always found him to be a honest, level headed, and straight forward person.  He believes the man to be credible.

We were driving back from Los Angeles, CA to my home in San Jose, CA and were on the I-5 near the Firebaugh area. I knew I was here since my GPS in my car showed me that area. Suddenly there was heavy fog which almost made me not see the road and I slowed down a bit, after the fog somewhat cleared, I saw two lights like the headlights of a car going alongside my car in my window. First I thought it might be a reflection but there was no other cars around me for miles that I could see. I took my window down to see more closely. It seemed like a glider of some sort so my first thought was that maybe its some sort of radar device which the government uses to check speeds of vehicles on the highways or a helicopter. But it none of those. Then it glided down really smoothly and quite beautifully almost touching the ground giving me an idea it was landing. I was looking ahead and looking at it at the same time and slowed my car a bit also. Being honest, at that point I was a little scared as the object without landing just took off again and went over in front of me over the highway across and it cast two lights in the field. The lights were just like ordinary white lights throughout but the object seemed like it was spinning. It stood in the field for about 5-10 seconds casting those lights in a triangulated fashion really beautifully. The object suddenly turned from there and came straight for my car, the lights from it were really bright, almost blinding; at which point I was getting paranoid that whatever it was going to hit my car. But it came on the top of my car and was gone! Yes it was just gone, disappeared totally. I also looked into my back mirror but there was nothing there except absolute darkness. I took the next exit for the gas station and a little while later an SUV stopped from which a lady emerged and I tried to ask her if she saw something. But I guess it was the time of the night, I saw the look in her eyes which was telling me I&apos;m some kind of weirdo...I was yelling for my friends to wake up as they were sleeping but they confirmed to me later they did see some kind of light as at that point they had woken up. I do not know what to make out of it but I know what I saw and it lasted for a good minute or maybe more. It was just a beautiful object, what it was I think I&apos;ll never know but what I saw I&apos;ll never be able to forget.", "A Disk/cigar shaped object ,100m in lenght , bright orange to silver in colour, splits into 2 craft then reforms as one.We had been having some spectacular sunsets leading up to my recent sighting. This is my sixth to date. I was watching the sun set at 5pm. It had just set below the horizon and the sky was another painted masterpiece! Looking west from my house I can see the golf course and Airport on the hill. I suddenly noticed what I though at first was a meteor just right of the airport about 500m. It looked like a fireball. This object was hovering at tree level. When I realised that this was no meteor I grabbed my binoculars for a better look. Apon viewing the craft I was literally numb with shock. Then an amazing adrenalin rush took over.  The craft was huge. I estimate about 80/100m in length. It was shaped like a saucer but more cigar shaped. It was fluctuating between a whitish silver and the most amazing intense orange. Almost like a colour that I have never seen before (if that makes sense). It also had this strange shimmering effect, abit like heatwaves on the road. This part is hard to explain...... The craft appeared to be surrounded by what looked like a cloud.  The only way to explain it is to say, to me, it was a hole or a tear in space-time-reality and this object had sorta popped in for a look! I found this really hard to comprehend. I winessed something they don&apos;t teach us in science. The object suddenly began to move very slowly to the north still above tree level. About 10 minutes into the sighting the craft split into 2 objects. The both remained side by side for about 30 seconds and then joined as one again. I witnessed to object for about 15-20 minutes all up before it drifted behind a mountain and I lost sight of it. During the sighting I called a friend who has a video camera. Unfortunately due to the geography he couldn&apos;t see the craft. I have spoken to several people including a helicopter pilot who was working at the airport that day, but no one saw it. During the sighting I also observed 2 small aircraft fly near the object and land at the airport. I also got this sensation that it was showing itself to me, and me only!", "Ship flies into lakeThe ship looked like a jellyfish, a circle with long tentacles hanging from the bottom.  Sighting was on the North Beach of Bear Lake, a remote mountain lake.  Ship passed over the top of our pickup truck and into the lake.

At aproximately 2:47am while waiting for our camp fire to die down an object which was brilliant white light no strobes or sound could be seen or heard, Flew from a southernly direction over to our right and ahead of us to the north over some trees where it then proceeded to circle the area. The object could be seen as it passed behind the trees. It then dotted to the right along the trees Rising just above the tree line and then back to the south where it turned and then headed east and out of view. It then came back into view from the east and again ahead of us just over some trees. We could see the object kind of circling behind the trees before it dissapeared. Note: when the object was flying it looked as if it were skipping like a light being turned on then off then back on again made it look like dots being drawn in the sky. earlier in the evening it was overcast but the sky was clear at this point during the sighting. I did grab my video camera but so far I can&apos;t really see anything on it but static and our own voices.It looked saucer shaped but with a small flat section around what seemed like the back of it.", "Bright light moving at constant speedI was looking at stars on a clear night when I spotted an object that was just a spec of light moving in a straight line from directly above to the Northwest.  It was not moving very fast, so I thought it was a satellite.  It did not blink or twinkle.  It suddenly began growing in magnitude and got so bright it left a retinal burn that lasted a little while, maybe 5 minutes.  It kept moving without sound, never picking up speed or stopping, but soon faded into the dark.  I have no way to tell how high it was, but suspect it to have been very high, possibly in space.  This experience was quite humbling.  I waited a while to see if there were any more, but there were not, and it did not return.", "Very close view of oval/disk shaped craft in the spring of 1964On a clear spring night before the leaves returned to the trees in 1964 (April I think) just after sunset, my girl friend and I were in the front yard of my parents house with my reflector telescope. The location was Valley Station, Kentucky, about &frac34; mile east of Pond Creek on a lightly traveled road with houses and fields.  We were checking out the moon and stars. I tried to sight in a large yellow star directly above us but I just could not get the proper angle, so I shifted the scope to a bright star more along the horizon to the southeast. I was adjusting the focus, with one eye on the eyepiece, and the other eye looking at the ground. My friend started yelling, &quot;Look&quot; and at the same time I noticed the ground started to take on a yellow glow.  I looked up and there was an oval shaped glowing and humming craft above us. The craft was about 50 foot by 40 foot and about 15 foot tall at the peak of the center.  It was hovering about 15 feet above the tree top, approximately 100 feet above the ground and slightly to the south of us about 10 feet. It was somewhat elongated (left to right) and the outer edge of the craft was beveled or rounded and had 3 windows along the edge I saw, and the orientation of the craft did not change very much so I don&rsquo;t know what the other side looked like. The windows were about 1.5 foot wide by 1 foot tall and they were somewhat oval shaped with a bluish white florescent glow inside, but I could only see slightly inside and saw nothing other than a white overhead. There were some sort of recessed/level red lights around it.  We could feel the heat from the craft, no smell other than heat, and as the very low hum rose in pitch, the glow changed from dark yellow to a golden color.  There appeared to be some sort of burnt crusty material on the under surface that was a slightly darker glow. As the hum rose in pitch the craft glowed golden, and then slowly moved about 300 feet to the south over a field. A bright spotlight came out of the bottom of the craft and it scanned the hills from east to the north and stopping directly on us.  The light was of the intensity of a carbon arc search light even thought the light housing was about football size. After the light shown directly on us for about 5 seconds it turned off and the light was retracted inside. The hum then increased rapidly in pitch, the glow was almost white, and the craft raised and move to the west at an ever increasing speed. As it approached the creek something that looked like a chunk of the crusty material from the bottom fell (nobody could find anything) near the creek. As it moved rapidly off to the west in a straight line, it abruptly changed course about 30 degrees to the northwest and faded off into the distance at an incredible speed. Total time: 6 to 7 minutes. From the time it started to move to the west were screaming for my family to come out and see it but they were too late.  We gave my family all the details and I drew a picture of it.  The next day my Aunt, who was visiting one of my uncles at a nearby house, told my mom she saw it too. The one thing about this that still sticks in my mind was the exit. As it changed course, it reminded me the way a stick looks when you put it into a bucket of water, how the image appears to bend. I have not told many about this, because I didn&rsquo;t want to be ridiculed.  I am getting old now and thought this may be useful to someone.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The reason I&apos;ve decided to actually contact someone about this is that I have had memories of this incident that have haunted me for over 40 years that I was never quite sure was real or a dream.  That is, until I mentioned it to my father almost 10 years ago (he died in 1996) and he said it really happened.  I wanted to investigate it then, but was sidetracked.  Then yesterday, my younger sister and I were discussing some childhood memories and she asked me, &quot;What was that about ufo&apos;s at our school?&quot;  I knew it was time to ask someone who could actually find information and probably others who remember this incident. It happened sometime between March 1966 and June 1967.  I was attending Opa Locka Elementary School in the northernmost part of Miami, Florida.  It was either the end of my 5th grade (66) or during the 6th grade (66-67).This is the memory I have:  Around noon, the police and alot of military (probably National Guard) came and evacuated the school.  There were alot of people standing around watching, but I just remember being escorted from the school because, (I saw this myself) 3 UFO&apos;s were hovering over the school yard.  It&apos;s funny that the actual UFO&apos;s are a blur to me, and the fact that we got to leave school early was the part that I remember being most excited about.  However, I remember seeing 3 objects, oblong but with 3 softly rounded sides shaped alot like a turnover, 1 long side with 2 shorter coming to a point in the center.  This was the shape from underneath not from the side.  They were metallic and very smooth and rounded.  I don&apos;t remember any sound coming from them.  There was one hovering over the Portable building, one over the woods just beside the school playgrounds, and one on the other side of the school.  I don&apos;t remember seeing that one, but for some reason, I know it was there.Is there anyone out there that remembers this or has any information?  Pictures would be fabulous.  I can&apos;t imagine that it wasn&apos;t in the Miami Herald.  I have no way to find it myself.  I am also really curious to see how they explained this one.  If my memory is correct, they hovered there for most of the evening.  I don&apos;t know how long or anything about their departure.  I really don&apos;t remember them arriving.  Just seeing them there when were escorted from the school property.  And now that I know my sister also remembers, I want answers.  Please help if you can. The military doesn&apos;t evacuate schools due to weather balloons.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Object was very large, very high, and very fast.I believed, initially, that it was one craft but at the end it may have actually been 3. On that particular night I had stayed up to see the ISS passover, it was due at 4:30 AM, and when I went out at 3:29 AM to have a cigarette, I was looking in the sky in the direction the ISS would be coming from, SSW and almost immediately saw 3 white lights in a triangular shape moving from that direction towards me. I looked inside at the clock, because I thought maybe I was mistaken as to the time, and saw that it was 3:30 AM. I came back to the railing and watched the 3 lights. 2 of the lights were on what I presumed was the front with one light trailing behind but centered on the other 2. There appeared to be about a 1/2 degree separation between the 2 lead lights and the other trailed about 1 to 1 1/2 degrees behind. The object appeared to be moving across the sky at about the same rate that the ISS appears to be moving whenever I see it. As I continued to watch it, I realized that it would be passing directly over my head. I noticed that any stars which it seemed to pass in front of would disappear until after it had passed that position in the sky. After a couple of minutes I further realized that the object was not getting any larger, as a plane would if it were approaching, which meant that it had to be extremely high for that to happen. I watch planes on a regular basis and even when they are flying at 20,000 to 30,000 feet I can still notice a change in size as they come closer. Therefore, whatever this was it had to be very, very large. I never heard any sound or saw any other lights on or around it. Just before it got over my head, one of the lead lights suddenly started pulling away from the other 2 at a tremendous rate which made me think that maybe this was not one craft but three. However, I remembered from earlier when it had passed in front of the stars that it had seemed to be solid. Now, suddenly, one of the lights was pulling away very quickly. At this point I had to question w! hether it was 1, 2 or 3 objects I was actually seeing and, if it was more than one object, then why did the stars get blotted out &quot;behind&quot; it. As it disappeared, I live on the second floor of a 3 story condo building, pass the edge of the roof, the light which had begun pulling away from the other 2 now had about a full degree of seperation from the light which it had earlier had only about a 1/2 degree of seperation from earlier, and the other lead light and trailing light had not changed position relative to one another. Since then I have been puzzling out in my mind how it could have blotted out the stars if it were actually 3 objects instead of one. My conclusion is that it must have been one object, but somehow maybe launched something that was at that one point, that it was extremely high flying (possibly suborbital or even in orbit), was travelling extremely fast for the altitude and was very large because if it was at an altitude of 100 miles up in orbit, it would have had to be miles long. I can hear jets fly over at altitudes up to about 40,000 feet so since I could not hear it it had to be at least that high, and at even 50,000 feet, given it&apos;s apparent size, it would have been thousands of feet long to take up that big a slice of sky.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "My husband had been sitting the computer in our den when he noticed rotating red, white and blue lights in our back yard.  It was a hot, dark summer night and the windows were open.  He did not hear any sound and although he looked up into the night sky to see where the lights were coming from, he could not see anything.  He came to bed and woke me up saying, &quot;Look out the window and tell me what you see.&quot;  I had to put my eyeglasses on to see.  I got on my knees and looked one of two windows that overlook our back yard.  I could see the rotating lights.  The lights moved continuously from one side to the other along our neighbors fence.  They also ran perfectly between two sheds in our back yard.  The lights stayed inside the space between the sheds and only shone on the tall picket fence.  My first thought was that the police were in his yard shining their lights but his fence pickets are close together so that much light would not be able to shine on our side of his fence like they were.  I then looked out a third window in our bedroom which looks over our driveway onto the main road near our home hoping to see a police car or a fire truck.  I saw nothing.  My heart was pounding and I was curious as to what was causing these lights to shine in our back yard.  I then walked into our son&apos;s bedroom in the front of the house.  His room has two windows, one over the driveway and one in the front overlooking the entire front yard.  I pulled up the blinds and looked from left to right seeing absolutely no police or fire trucks.  What was going on?  I was getting scared now.  I walked to the other side of our home into the dining room.  The windows in the dining room face the front yard and the side yard facing our next door neighbor.  It was pitch black outside.  Although we have trees surrounding our home we can still see moonshine if the moon is up.  I have never checked any almanac to see what cycle the moon was in on July 18, 1997 but I bet there was no moonlight.  It was pitch!  I saw no police or fire trucks.  I cannot imagine what other vehicle could be emitting these lights except a police car or a fire truck.  No other lights that I know of rotate like the kind on top of a police car and these lights were closer to that type of fast rotation but they were faster.  So now the only place I could go to get a last look would be into the den where my husband had originally seen the lights.  Mind you, he never told me what he saw ... he only told me to look up from the bed I had been sleeping in and tell him what I saw!  When I got to the sliding doors, I was afraid.  I froze!  By this time I had been thinking about where these lights could be coming from and since I had not seen or heard anything from the opened windows that would give me a single clue as to where these lights were coming.  The only logical idea I could come up with was, &quot;What if there is a burglar in our yard with some sort of &quot;spectacular&quot; flashlight or something along those lines?&quot;  &quot;What if this burglar sees me in the den?&quot;  &quot;He might see me seeing him and I live here ... I was so scared.&quot;  I could not open the sliding door to enter the den to look out those windows.  Instead I walked back to our bedroom.  I asked my husband if he thought maybe we had left the light in the sunroom on ... maybe we had left the light and the fan on.&quot;  I wondered out loud if that would make the lights in the back yard.  I was grasping at straws, I admit that now but then I was just trying to figure out every conceivable idea that might make some sense.  I asked him if he wanted to go downstairs with me to check the sunroom.  He did not want to go.  So, I just kneeled on the bed and strained my eyes and ears to hear anything.  I may have kneeled that way for another ten minutes and then the lights just stopped.  I waited to hear crunching sounds on the ground and there was not a single sound of any kind.  I lay down and my heart was pounding out of my chest.  We eventually went to sleep.  In the morning I went downstairs to open the curtains to the sunroom to see if the lights and ceiling fan were on.  They were off!  I walked into the room and went right up to the glass windows which run from the ceiling to the floor to see if there were any footprints in the grass.  It&apos;s a stretch but I wanted to look for any clue that might make the whole incident more &quot;earth bound&quot; than unidentified!  About a month after this event, I was reading the Eagle Tribune and in the Sound Off portion of the paper where folks can call in a question or voice an opinion, I read a short story where a caller wanted to know if anyone had noticied the rotating lights that were shining for about an hour one night over the dump in Derry.  I have never seen or heard anything else about these lights in this area.  We never told our neighbors or called the local authorities to report.  That was seven years ago just this past Sunday and I finally feel that enough time has elapsed that I can write about it.  It would be interesting to know if anyone else in Salem, NH has ever seen lights like this or had a similar experience.  Thanks!", "Observed what appeared to be a bright, slow satellite do a 180 degree turn.I was &quot;sky watching&quot; in my front yard in west Flagstaff around 2115 hours, Monday, July 5th, 2004.  I spotted five satellites in less than five minutes.  All exhibited the &quot;basic&quot; characteristics of satellites regarding speed, distance, and size. Soon after spotting the last one of these, I noticed another coming from the south and moving towards the area of the night sky near the &quot;handle&quot; of the Big Dipper constellation.  I immediately tried sighting it through my binoculars (10x50) using the normal technique of aiming in &quot;front&quot; of the object (ahead of it along its apparent trajectory), assuming it had a straight line trajectory as satellites do.  I noticed also that it seemed slightly brighter than the other satellites I&apos;d seen that evening (about twice as bright) and that it was moving about 1/3 to 1/2 less than the speed of the previously spotted satellites. I couldn&apos;t see it through my binoculars, and lowered them.  I could see it easily with the naked eye however, yet each time I lifted the binoculars to the area where it should have been travelling, I couldn&apos;t find it.  I kept lowering the binoculars, recapturing it with my unaided eyesight, then lifting the binoculars again, only to lose sight of the object.  After four or five attempts, I gave up trying to spot it with the binoculars and just &quot;eyeballed&quot; it. Then I discovered why the object was hard to track.  As it was travelling toward the north, it was also turning slightly to the right (east).  When the object reached the point in the sky where its apparent position was between the two outermost stars which make up the &quot;handle&quot; of the Big Dipper, it began a slow but tighter turn toward the east.  It completed this turn after a course change of about 180 degrees, and then continued heading back toward the south.  The object completed this 180 degree turn when it reached the point in the sky where its apparent position placed it in between the four stars which make up the &quot;scoop&quot; or dipper part of the Big Dipper.  Thus, the apparent diameter of this 180 curve ascribed by this object was the apparent distance from in between the first and second stars of the Big Dipper&apos;s handle to the middle of the Big Dipper&apos;s scoop. There was no sound associated with this object. I&apos;ve never seen a satellite do that before... or, was it a satellite?", "4 objects sighted within a period of one hour. Looked like faint moving stars. (Not satellites). Fourth object was flashing.It&apos;s still continuing. 3 of them looked like satellites, but no satellites were crossing Atlanta at the time. In other words, they appeared to be faint moving stars. The fourth one was flashing. The first sighting was in one specific area but the other three were relatively in the same area. The last sighting(fourth one) was around 10:35pm Eastern Standard. They appeared to move from South to North.", "Four bright lights with blinking light in the middle seen over Cornilius PassI witnessed this strange thing over 4 years ago, but I didn&apos;t tell anyone until just recently about what I saw.  I am a 50 year old woman and didn&apos;t want my family to think I was crazy.  It wasn&apos;t until I mentioned it to someone I know about my experience that they told me that they also had seen a UFO in the same area.  This is what happen to me.  I was driving home over Cornilius Pass in Portland heading to my home in Scappoose, Or.  I had been over at my parents home in Portland.  As I neared Cornilius Pass just before a corner I saw 4 large lights in each corner of this object with a blinking red light in the middle, hanging above the Pine trees.  There was no noice even though I was with in 150 feet of it.  The lights were very bright yet my car was not lit up by the lights.  I would say that the lights were at least 30 feet from light to light.  My first thought was that something was going to crash on the other side of the trees.  As I got closer and went around the corner in the road to the other side of the trees, I looked to see if something had crashed.  I didn&apos;t see anything at all.  I suddenly got a feeling of dread.  I knew I had seen something I couldn&apos;t explain.  I continued down the road through Cornilius Pass Road.  Which is dark and not too many house are there, I kept looking through the trees to see if I could see it again.  I wanted to stop on the road and look better but I was by myself and the road has no shoulders or driveways to pull into.  About 1 1/2 miles from where I first saw the lights I saw through the trees a V shaped row of lights now hovering above the hill on the other side of where I was driving. I would say there was about three to four lights on each side of the V with one light in the front middle.  There was also a spot light coming down from either the front of the V or just behind the V.  It was spot lighting the ground below.  After seeing that I hit the peddle to the car and got out of there.  It was probably a year ago that I mentioned it to! a friend of my daughters what I saw.  She told me that she has seen a dish shaped UFO following her on the same road.  This has happen to her twice.  I am sorry but I could not tell its shape because the lights were so bright but I can tell you it was big.  I grew up with my dad who was a pilot and have seen many different kinds of planes and helicopters but I have never seen anything like this.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was spinning and wobbling as it moved slowly across the sky.  It was also flipping over and over as it went.  The sun reflected off it as it flipped.  We watched it for about 2-3 minutes as it went from west to east and disappeared behind the tree line.", "Lighted Object shooting straight up in the sky makes TV go haywireIt was about 2:30 in the morning and my tv (non cable channels) kept getting very fuzzy off and on, this was happening all night and as I was watching tv out of the corner of my eye I saw something outside when I first saw it it seemed like there was different colors on it but when I ran to my window I only saw yellow lights, three of them in a row with the middle one a little bit lower than the other two.It was making a loud staticy, hummming noise, hard to explain. It was going straight up, not on a slant like airplanes, and I called all the airports in my area there were no airplanes out at that time.

The object was bouncing up and down, not flying in a straight line. The light was constant and there was not a flasing light like you would see on a plane. The object also stopped for just a second, then started to fly faster.", "Several lights spotted along I-5, maybe helicopters but they flew low over crops, changed their light set ups, and flew real radical.I was riding with a friend Friday night, driving from San Diego, California, to the San Jose area up near San Francisco. We were driving through the San Joanquin Valley area when I started to spot some lights in the sky off to the East side of the highway. What caught my attention was that I saw 4 white lights rise up, almost in a straight line, then angle off, turn, and seem to dim. Then the aircraft apparently turned to face the highway again and I saw the four lights level off and look real bright. It looked like a plane coming into land at an airport. I watched it land, but right after it came in close to the ground, it turned, and rose straight up off the ground again vertically. That&apos;s what made me think it was a helicopter. I thought it was strange and mentioned it to my friend. I looked back over my shoulder to watch it some more and it continued making odd ariel manuevers. We kept driving, however. I thought that would be it, but we kept driving, and further up, I spotted it again. This time I was able to point it out to my friend. Just like before, these lights made the same odd pattern. They rose up in a straight line, banks, and flew around over more crops. I don&apos;t know how many their were, but I spotted three at one time, so, I know it wasn&apos;t the same aircraft, and I saw at least one land. This luckily happened closer to the highway than the other lights and I could make out more. There was a flashing light at the top of the aircraft, which, everything about it seemed to say helicopter to me, but I couldn&apos;t see it&apos;s shape, just lights. When this helicopter landed, it was facing a vehicle that was parked in a field at the edge of some tall crop. The vehicle had lights on, maybe a door open with interior lights on as well, but I couldn&apos;t see anyone. The helicopter sat there on the ground for a bit, then lifted back up, circled, and then turned on a spotlight. It actually flashed across the highway for a moment as he began flying over the crops again. All this occurred between Kettleman City and Los Banos along the I-5. I saw more of this  towards Kettleman City than Los Banos. The number of lights and their frequency tapered off as we drove further north. Now, I know that these aren&apos;t exactly black triangles I&apos;m reporting and I&apos;m not native to that area, but this just seemed really odd to me. Is this normal for the San Joanquin Valley? It&apos;s just crops out there, no really large townsthat I could see. I find it hard to believe that each farmer out there has his own private helicopter to crop his fields with at night, and I doubt I watched a half dozen police helicopter look for someone. What did I see? Is there some explanation for this? Maybe someone who lives in the area can help me out.", "while headed north on route 522 i noticed a silver orb , at first I thought it was a high altidude ballon with a milar coteing . while I watched the &quot;ballon&quot; mad a quick move to the right and stopped then to the left and stopped.

They did not stay lit like the gunnery lights,(gunnery lights flare when they light up, stay a consistant brightness, then totally burn out...they don&apos;t keep lighting up over and over, again.)

It only moved about a foot in the sky and then disappeared without fading. It is totally clear here tonight. I said to myself what the hell was that?

The first cluster contained about five objects and the second cluster contained four objects. The first cluster was at a slightly higher elevation than the second. The objects in both clusters maintained a tight formation. Because of this, and the speed of the objects, neither witness felt that the objects were balloons. In fact, they had no idea what the objects were. Both witnesses are college educated. The weather at the time was clear with a few scattered clouds and no discernible wind.

PD))", "One thousand saucers observed telescopically crossing the sun over a ninety minute period.My sister, cousin, mother and I all were witness to an event where over one-thousand UFOs crossed the sun one bright summer day in New Orleans, Louisiana. (They were viewed telescopically as they crossed the sun&rsquo;s disk (details below). The day was a usual clear blue sky scorcher, and being an avid amateur astronomer, I spent much of the day and night just looking around the sky and keeping notes. It was 1971 and I was 13 years old. The summer was typically boring, and so I tried out my 2.5 inch refractor telescope given to me by my parents a couple of years earlier on sunspot observations; once again, I borrowed a chair from my mother&rsquo;s kitchen, and placed a leftover poster board (they were only white in those days) on the chair to accept the image from the telescope eyepiece. This way everyone could enjoy the huge image of the broiling sun at the same time as me and I could leisurely sit in the chair I had taken from my desk to make notes and sketch sunspots. This was the umpteenth time I had done this and so I was the only one watching when the event started, interest from the rest of my family having waned over the last many times I had performed this type of observation. After several hours of watching and sketching that June day in 1971, I noticed a small black dot cross from right to left across the sun&rsquo;s disk. Being experienced at seeing planes, birds, and insects fly by I was initially puzzled by this rather non-descript and slowly moving object. It took about 5 seconds to cross and was about 1/40 of the sun&rsquo;s apparent diameter on the poster board. This made the object about a half inch in length. My curiosity increased when a second object began crossing from the right just before the first one exited on the left side of the sun&rsquo;s disk. I immediately refocused the refractor to get the crossing object better focused, as it had a well defined gray annulus around the black center. Interestingly, the focus for the sun (essentially infinity) was the correct focus for the object! Before the second object exited the sun&rsquo;s disk to my left (after crossing about 4/5 of the sun&rsquo;s diameter), a third object entered from the right. Each of these objects were identical; they consisted of a black (matching the center of sunspots, essentially) lozenge shaped center, surrounded by a uniform thickness, very sharply defined gray annular ring. The lozenge length to width was about 3 to one, and the annular gray ring was slightly less than half the thickest (center) part of the black shadow. (In reviewing the sighting afterwards, I took a dish from my mother&apos;s cabinet and found that if one held the dish so that it was about 30 degrees from edge on, the projected shape roughly matched the objects I had sighted.)  The three objects all exhibited the same shimmering that the sun&rsquo;s disk and sunspots exhibited, indicating they were far enough up in the air (or out in space?) to be affected by the atmosphere in the same way stars twinkle. I was watching in the afternoon and so my refractor was angled about 45 degrees above horizontal to start with, and about an hour and a half later (after the last object had crossed), it was less than 30 degrees. After another half dozen or so had crossed the face of the sun and cast their shadows on my poster board, I had enough data to enable me to leave the scene and gather my family as witnesses. My cousin and sister were playing outside at the time (they were about three years and two years younger than me, respectively), and so I brought them to the telescope to see what was happening. Being only 10 and 11 years old, their interest waned after just three crossings, since the scenario remained identical; just prior to one object leaving the  disk to our left, another entered from our right, over and over. After less than a half minute, they went back to whatever they were doing before I coaxed them into watching &ldquo;that boring stuff Herbie does&rdquo;. I yelled for my mom to come see; we lived in one of those duplex shotgun houses in New Orleans; they were called shotgun houses because you could fire a weapon from the front room and it would go all the way through to the one bathroom at the rear without hitting any wall but going through the open doors of each of the four rooms (after the front room, the parent&rsquo;s bedroom, then the children&rsquo;s bedroom, then the living room, then the kitchen). It was easy to yell for her even though she was all the way back in the kitchen. Her reply was typical of when I asked her to come see something &ndash; whether through my microscope or telescope; a delaying action born of many observations of relatively boring (to her) objects. She said she was busy and would be there soon. I asked her to bring the camera (a box black and white) so I could photograph the sun&rsquo;s disk and these crossing objects, and again she said she&rsquo;d be there soon. After about an hour I had to relieve myself (one does drink fluids in New Orleans on a hot summer day!) and so I asked my sister to take over and watch if anything changes. I took the opportunity to implore my mother to come see again and after I returned to the refractor and the objects passing (my sister had already abandoned her post to go play again) she showed up without the camera, saying it had no film. She watched for about 30 seconds and then went back to the kitchen, apparently as uninterested in the whole thing as my sister and cousin; it didn&rsquo;t affect anything that day (or even for the conceivable future), and so I alone was left to the task of watching what I could only assume were alien visitors from space moving from one place to another in single file in their flying saucers. About 90 minutes after the procession started, it ended. Not as abruptly as it started, however. At first near the end there was no follower to the object exiting to the left side of the sun&rsquo;s disk where it should have been, but then another would show up timed as if there had been the &quot;missing&quot; object, and followed appropriately by the next object entering from the right as the prior object exited to the left. This occurred several times before no more objects entered or exited the sun&rsquo;s image. Altogether I estimated 1,080 (that&rsquo;s one-thousand and eighty, give or take) had passed between my 2.5 inch objective refractor telescope with Barlow lens and the sun. Near what was to be the middle of the event, or about 45 minutes into the procession - the density of crossing increased several times. At one point there were five objects &quot;on screen&quot; at the same time. A single object entered from the right, as usual when the prior object was nearing its exit to the left, when a pair of objects entered shortly after. The top object in this pair was in line with the boring procession as it had unfolded for the last three quarters of an hour, but the companion was below and to the rear, offset about half the length of one of these objects and down about the width in close proximity. When the single object had reached the spot where another object entered opposite it on the sun&rsquo;s face, another object did enter, and was followed almost immediately by another (fifth) object. This train of discs continued across, followed by four in line objects, and then the pattern returned to normal, with only two objects on the sun&apos;s face at any one time (until the end of the event, of course). Also during what was to be the middle of the event, I tried to detect the objects before and after they crossed the sun proper, by moving my telescope just off to either side of the sun and looking directly out into the clear blue sky. I saw nothing through the refractor (neither directly or cast on the poster board), nor did I see anything with the naked eye as I shielded my vision with my hand from direct sunlight. Were they ours or theirs? Earth made or made somewhere else? I don&rsquo;t know. However, subsequent to this observation, I read in a Charles Fort book that a Mexican astronomer by the name of Bonilla had witnessed a similar train of shadows in 1883. More recently, I have found several other astronomical sightings through the internet that resemble my 1971 event (though with far fewer numbers) and I have done some back of the envelope calculations using elementary trigonometry that shows the objects would have been about 100 feet in diameter if exo-atmospheric. Additionally, the difference in girth from a thin plate held at an angle and the thicker, lozenge shape of these objects I found could be explained if they had some thickness to them. There are other analyses and minor observations related to this event, but these are best left for a later time, as this e-mail has gotten way too big already!  If anyone else has heard of or seen such things, I would appreciate feedback.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It moved unlike anything I&apos;d ever seen before. After what seemed like an hour (although it was in reality only 5 minutes), it dissapeared in a zoom like manner.

A small plane that was flying north to south had caught my girlfriend&apos;s eye. As the plane passed she asked &quot;what is that white thing?&quot; When I looked up I saw what I first thought to be a white pelican. But on further observation the white object appeared to not have the black wing tips of a pelican and was not moving. I ran into the house and got my 20X50 binoculars for further investigan. I was back outside within 15 seconds and could no longer spot it with my eyes. She had kept her focus on it and pointed out the area it was in. When it was first spotted it was aprox. 75 deg. above the eastern horizon. The sky was clear and the setting sun was to our backs. When I arrived back it was now aprox. 60 deg. up and still towards the east. With the binoculars I now saw what appeared to be three brightly colored lights in a close, touching, triangle formation. The lights appeared to be one bright red, one bright orange and one faded white in color. The three seemed to rotate around the center point of the triangle formation. The rotation would cycle clockwise only to the point where the bottom left light would rotate into the top lights position then counter-clockwise back again. The top and right bottom lights would follow all together, top to bottom right and bottom right to bottom left position then back again. After aprox. 5-6 minutes the object could no longer be seen without the aid of the binoculars. I continued watching the object until it slowly disappeared at about 8:15PM. The object when it was last seen was aprox. 40 degs. up in the eastern sky.In talking with my girlfriend she stated that when she first saw it, it was behind the small plane and about half the size of that plane.We are regular sky watchers who enjoy bird watching during the day and &quot;space junk&quot; watching at night.

It was then we decided to do our firework.  I glanced over and saw a small white light slowly moving behind-through the trees, hovering back and forth.  We lit it off and got the heck out of dodge, passing by the field where the object was originally sighted.  Nothing.  Darkness.  Coming out of the forest I glanced back and saw that white light above the trees, moving quickly to the right and holding it&apos;s position there, rising as we moved further away.

My brother was the first to spot it. At first glance, it was hard to even see it, but over a period of about 5 to 10 minutes, it grew more intense. I yelled for my parents to come outside with the binoculars, and we each took turns looking at the apparent U.F.O. over the next several minutes. As I said, at first it was a dim light, but as it grew more intense, you could see through the binoculars that it had 3 lights in a triangular fashion that would appear, disappear, and reappear; almost as if it was rotating in a fixed position in the sky. It continued to do this until the craft departed, leaving a vapor trail, at an angle going upward and westward. Right before it disappeared for good, my brother was the one who had the binoculars at the time, and he claimed that the craft, or whatever it was seemed to morph and appeared as an iridescent disc, shining red, blue, green, and yellow, before zipping off. I am not sure if it was a coincidence, but at the moment that the craft disappeared, a jet flying at a lower altitude than the craft was flying across the sky in the same vicinity as the U.F.O.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "Bright objects seen for extended periods on cloudy night.Bright hovering lights, observed in front of some low hanging clouds. The brightest of the objects was low on NW of field of view, other objects were scattered in a sort of triangular/chevron pattern spanning from NW to SW. Would easily have been identified as stars if not for a couple of obvious problems. The brightest and 2nd brightest remained visible inside of and in front of a large cloud formation and cast a glow inside of their respective clouds (glow in front of and behind). The brightest one would grow dull to the naked eye to the point of dissapearing completely and then become as bright as a high powered flashlight pointed at the eye from perhaps a distance of yards (very hard to discribe). The @nd brightest object (when observed by binoculars) appeared to have a small faint red object fly from it at an amazing speed. This was also witnessed by 2 friends, one roused from sleep, and the other at his night job where the light pollution made it possible for him to only see the bright one. The shapes were difficult to determine as they were very indistinct. The largest reminded me of a cylinder and then at times as a trapazoidal object, the others were the same but smaller or perhaps farthur. The small faint red dot was only witnessed by myself through the binoculars.The bright object is also in the sky now (05:12 on the 25 clear sky conditions). A smaller color flashing object is also present to it&apos;s south closer to the horizon. When the object is at it&apos;s brightest it is unmistakably 3 dimensional. I live close to the border of the Miramar base and many things have been observed over the years. I am usually held to skepticism but my curiosity has made me search for some enlightenment. I have scoured the web trying to find an astronomical answer and cannot. I do not use any kinds of drugs but am an ardent night owl. I&apos;ve never reported anything at all and truly believe I&apos;ve seen something unusual and hope that other people can give me some insight. I have met others from this area with similar stories.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.  Ordinarily, we would have guessed that a sighting of a bright object might have been Venus, but Venus is not in the northwest sky at this hour.  PD))", "At Midnight, both my husband an I were outside gazing at stars when we noticed a large triangular object with a pattern of 5 lights. The lights were very dim, whitish-gray in color and likely would not be noticed other than the fact that we both asked if the other saw them. We heard no sound and saw only the one object. It was not translucent as it clearly blocked the stars above as it traveled across the sky.It traveled North to south until we lost sight of it 10-15 seconds after we spotted it. It&rsquo;s motion was stealth like and seemed to float.   I also noticed an unusually large number of falling stars throughout the evening approx 15 over a couple of hours. Whether this is related I do not know but thought it&rsquo;s worth mentioning.  I have attached a picture to better illustrate our sighting.

As a stargazer I looked across the sky to see what was up.  I saw a light that looked like a plane comming from the direction that planes usually fly from in my neck of the woods.  I noticed that this object was different.  It appeared to keep going up as to go into orbit.  There were no marker lights on this object, like the ones aircraft have.  I also noticed the object moving in stages.  It seemed to move a little, then it moved a bit more, as if it got a boost.  I don&apos;t think this was an alien craft but I do believe that it was something unusual.  I attempted to run inside and get my Tele Vue refractor telescope to get a better view.  I got the scope set up very quickly however, it was not quick enough.  The object was either to faint to see or was in orbit.  After being very frustrated I went inside to see if any orbiters have been launched today.  The only thing that is close in terms of a launch date is July 11th.  That is when Boeing is launching the AURA ozone layer data collecting orbiter from Vandenburg AFB in California.

I also like attempting to track satellites and orbiting booster rockets using my scopes&apos; electronic drive. The atmospheric conditions had steadily been getting worse all night and because my scope is somewhat labor intensive to set up, I decided not to bring it out after glancing Northwest and noticing a star flickering more than usual, typically a sure sign of turbulence in the air and generally poor &quot;seeing&quot;, also the scattered cloud cover was quickly changing to broken while moving from WSW to ENE.At that point, I noticed the &quot;star&quot; had some distinct red flashes mixed with some green and was quickly looking like one of the many commercial jets that overfly the area heading either N-S or S-N. I then began looking at the object closer and could clearly see multiple red lights and one green light and also that it looked to be at fairly high altitude but curiously, the object appeared to be motionless and looked to be between magnitude 0 and -1.Intrigued, I stood still and stared at it, comparing the distance of the lights laterally(about the width of my fist held out at arms length) to a nearby tree for approximatley 5 minutes during which time the object never moved. At that point, the object began to slowly move ENE, decreasing the distance to the edge of the tree by about 30% over a period of 20-25 seconds before stopping again.My thinking at that time was that this was most likely a helicopter but possibly a U.S Marine AV-8 Harrier in hover mode. However, what happened next left me absolutley stunned.The lights began slowly moving ENE(left to right) again but VERY rapidly increased to roughly 5 times the speed that I&apos;ve observed the International Space Station cross the sky and in about 2 seconds it disappeared behind the tree causing me to verbally exclaim &quot;Whoaaa..Ho Ho!!&quot; and blink several times.I then walked West out to the sidewalk and reaquired the object which had stopped again.I was extremely tempted by now to go inside and make an attempt to assemble my telescope, drag it out and get a good look at it but was worried that by the time I got it up and running the lights would have moved off or more likely be covered by the now increasing clouds but I had to get SOME sort of closer view besides the naked eye and after watching the lights in the new position for about 2min I decided to compromise and run into the house and grab binoculars, leaving my slippers where I had last been standing to aid in reaquirment. What I saw thru the binoculars was very clear even while holding them freehand.There were 3 very red lights in an arrowhead triangle &quot;V&quot; pattern, the point appeared to be facing ESE, directly between the 2 red lights on the &quot;short side&quot; of the triangle was a distinctly greenish-white light and in the center of the object was an orange light that was flashing on and off irratically. I then began walking North on the sidewalk about 25ft to two cars parked parallel in front of my house stepping between them and sitting on the bumper of one and resting my elbows on the trunk of the other to steady the image.I then noticed the area between the red lights was slightly but noticably darker than the surrounding sky and after about 8 min I witnessed the object &quot;yaw&quot; to my left and now point to about 170 deg. The yaw manuever took between 1-2sec.About a minute later, the orange light ceased flashing and stayed on solidly but then the red light on what I describe as the objects&apos; right(starboard) side(my left)began flashing rapidly at a rate of about 3 times per second for 7-10 seconds then up to nearly strobe light speed for 3-4 seconds then back to solid red for about 50sec and back to flashing.This went on for about 12min then all the lights stayed on solidly until clouds began obscuring them but just as the lights were about 70% obstructed, I again noticed they appeared to be flashing again, even thru the clouds until they were completely obscured.I&apos;m 39 and I have been seriously involved with astronomy for 7 years and am used to feilding questions about what someone &quot;saw&quot; from the public at starpartys and explaining what it was and why it appeared the way it did. I also have been heavily interested in all forms of aviation since the age of 9. I put this object thru every trial I could think of during the event, moving position to make sure it wasn&apos;t a reflection off telephone wires etc. This object was not, from my perspective, ANY kind of celestial body I know of or have ever witnessed before, including satellite de-orbits, Bolides or fireballs. This object was MOST DEFINATLEY inside the atmosphere and appeared to be solid. I would describe this event as having the highest &quot;Wow&quot; factor of my entire career looking skyward.

Since my brother and law and I had our children with us, we decided to stay outside to view a local fireworks display.  There were several neighbors doing the same in the vicinity.  After a few minutes of viewing I noticed one group of neighbors standing 10 feet away looking up in the opposite direction of the fireworks display.  I followed their line of sight and noticed two red points of light flickering in the sky.  What struck me at that moment is that these lights appeared to possess the same characteristics as the lights that I had seen on two previous occasions (single point, bright red, same intensity).  Both lights were located in roughly the same area as the single red light my family and I witnessed just after 12:00 AM New Years 2004 (I called several family members away from our party to witness that event) and a single red light I witnessed some time in the early morning hours of October 2003.  During the New Years sighting I watched a single red light slowly move from south to north and to nearly overhead where it then stopped and stayed stationary for 15-20 minutes.  The light subsequently disappeared.  During the October event I drove 3 miles west in an attempt to align myself directly under the light.  I did this in an effort to try to ascertain what exactly it was. I eventually positioned myself to what I perceived as being directly under it, but still could not make any real determination as to the type of aircraft I was observing.  It too then disappeared abruptly within 20-30 minutes of initial sighting.  July 4th&apos;s lights appeared stationary at about 75 degrees above the horizon west of our position. For the majority of the sighting there were two distinct lights approximately one fists distance from one another.  They appeared to remain equal distanced and didn&apos;t produce any sound.  Unlike the previous sightings these flickered. There were private aircraft in the area and on one occasion a small aircraft passed slightly east and under the lights as it continued on its the downwind leg for Gillespie (KSEE, small regional airport in the vicinity 2 miles north).  I would estimate the small aircraft was flying at 1000-1500 AGL.  These lights seemed much higher and both the small aircraft and unidentified lights were unaffected by one another&rsquo;s presence.  Some minutes later the north side light dimmed, flickered on and off in random pulses, almost like it was struggling to stay lit, then disappeared entirely.  The south side light continued to flicker for an additional 5 minutes and then it too disappeared.  The final light disappearance strangely coincided with the conclusion of the fireworks display. It seems too much of a coincidence that two of my observations occurred on holidays and during what most would consider the peak period of the holiday.  I live in a densely populated, brightly lit suburb in east San Diego.  I have 2 small regional airports within 15 miles, and MCAS Miramar is 10 miles northwest.  I have been on the MCAS Miramar air base several times and the installation has never struck me as a special projects installation.  It seems to me that any sort new platform testing from Miramar would be unlikely considering the base&apos;s proximity to greater San Diego.  Perhaps some type of new surveillance device related to homeland security?  The lights had to be noticed by many this time.", "Driving toward Toldeo Ohio around 7:30 pm, sun just beginning to set.  My girlfriend ((name deleted)) and I noticed a small cylindrical shaft of bright white slowly ascending in the sky before us.

After ascending for a few minutes the object simply faded away, though not within the cloud or behind any obstruction.  It simply dissolved.  Object left no trail.  A minute later a hellicopter flew out to roughly the same spot then turned and flew back in the direction it came.

Look at that!&quot; so I quick turned my head and observed a bright green light descending rapidly in a straight vertical line. The light faded before reaching the water, and travelled a distance of approximately 2 hand lengths with arm extended. It did not &quot;explode&quot; like a firework or a boat flare normally would.  There were no boats visible on the lake at the time, and it was too far over the water to have been a firework launched from the shore. We also did not hear any sound come from the object.

It came extreamly close to several stars that would have been blocked if the triangle would have been a perfect triangle, we were waiting to see if some of the object would block those, indicating a larger shape than the lights outlined, but this did not occur.  I am 48 years old ex-USAF electronics tech and the altitude was so high that the area inside the stars/lights appeared to be the same color as the space around it not darker as with a lower object.  I beleive this object should have been seen nationwide and could have been as large as several miles to several hundred miles across, if the altitude was 80+ miles to being in deep space.  It was if some thing took these stars and wanted to remove them from the sky, by sliding them off of the star map while no one was looking!

There was a lot of what I call &quot;heat lightning&quot; because it did not come down. In the middle of allof the lightning there was a red light pulsing in the clouds. One, two three, pause, one, two, pause, one two three so I knew it wasn&apos;t lightning and there are no TV, radio, or cell phone towers anywhere nearby, So I called my mother out to see it before it went away. She saw it and couldn&apos;t tell what it was either. Then it suddenly stopped pulsing and since it was above the cloud line disappeared. About a minute later the winds gusted up to about 60-70 MPH and some of our potted plants and plants in the garden started to snap so we started putting them in a protected area when almost directly above us the red pulsing started again. It was still above the clouds, but when it pulsed the shape was perfectly round and about 1/4 to a 1/2 mile across. The clouds were moving very quickly and the winds kept increasing but the object was stationary. It pulsed slowly three times and then stopped and dissapeared. As soon as it did the winds began to die down dramatically. We went inside and turned on a local TV channel and even though a news report was not on there was a small map in the corner of the screen showing which counties were under a severe thunderstorm alert.

I was about an hour or so from reaching moosejaw. With me was my mother, and two sisters. In the distance ahead, I could see what looked to be a fog or smoke. I asked my mother if she could see it as well, and she to saw it. I thought that It may be smoke from a brush fire. As the car entered the smoke, or fog, I noticed that there was no smell to it at all. I found that to be very strange. If It was smoke, you would have smelled it. All of sudden on the the left hand side of the road, in the ditch area, appeared what looked to a spinning fireball. The center of the ball was a darkish orange, the outer part of it was like a lighter orange, almost yellow. All of us seen it, and were very shocked by it&apos;s quick appearance. I was not to sure what to think about it. But my thoughts of wonder, soon turned to fear, when I noticed the ball was about two feet above the brush in the ditch. So including the depth of the ditch, this ball was hovering about six feet off the ground. There was no fire, just a hovering bright ball, letting off a myst of some sort. It wasn&apos;t a hard decision, to step on the gas, and get away from that area as quickly as possible. If that wasn&apos;t strange enough, what happened afterwards was beyond crazy. We had cleared the haze, or myst, what ever it was. In the distance behind me, I could see in my rear view mirror, two head lights. I remember thinking to myself, did they see what we just saw? The next thing I knew, the headlights were right at the back of the car. I thought again to myself, this guy is movin. So i moved as far to the right as I possibly could, to let him pass. Along side of my car, came a black semi trailer. No markings, with blacked out windows. This truck pulled in front of the car, and reduced it&apos;s speed so quickly, I had to slam on my breaks. I though maybe he had experianced some problems or something. So I went to pass him. he swerved right into the lane I was going to make the pass in, almost hitting the front of my car. When I reduced my speed and went back into the right hand lane, the truck did the exact same thing. Out of no where, from the top of the trailer, two lights appeared, they looked like what may be dock lights, that a semi driver may use to back into a bay. They were bright, and hurt the eyes. Then from the top and sides of the trailer, a unknown substance was being released towards the car. I remember not being able to see, and almost bringing the car to a complete stop. The substance cleared, and to my surprise, the trailer was right in front of me, with no more bright lights. I remember switching lanes, and speeding as fast as I could past the truck. I looked in the mirror, and saw the headlights behind me. When I took a second glance back. They were gone. We soon after pulled into the truck stop in Moosejaw. I remember getting out of the car, and waiting for the semi to come up the highway, it never did show. As I said at the start, we were an hour or so out of Moosejaw when this happened.

It was a full moon and I stepped out on my cement patio to feel the cool air. My dogs were up along the fence making their usual last leg lift before coming inside to sleep. They sleep inside because there are coyotes in the neighborhood. I live 15 miles north and a little east of town. It was bright out and while reaching for a chair I looked down on the white cement and noticed a shadow.  It was round.  I looked up and there was nothing up there to be its cause.  I looked on the roof -- perhaps a round object was up there that I didn&apos;t know about and it was casting a shadow down on the cement.  Nothing on the roof. I looked in the black Locust tree, maybe there was a round nest up there and it was casting a shadow. All I saw was the shape of the tree and a little light coming through branches. It was bright out and I looked up a little to the left of the only tree in my yard.  The moon was there a minute ago and it wasn&apos;t. There was no moon -- In the strangeness of the moment, I didn&apos;t put that piece into the puzzle until it was all over. I was not frightened.  I looked back down at the round shadow on the patio.  Still there and it was about ten feet in diameter.  I know because after the event I ran into the house and got a tape measure. But I&apos;m getting ahead of myself. Again I tried to find an overhead cause for the shadow on the patio and I was looking up and around and I noticed one of my dogs was watching something up in the sky.  Every so often he would jump into the air like he was trying to catch something. I walked around looking up and I walked into the shadow and watching my shadow emerge when I stepped back out. I stood quietly for maybe 45 seconds and I kept my eyes on it.  I watched the shadow as it started to move across the patio.  The one older dog, laying near my feet, jumped up and ran into the house and the other dog &quot;followed&quot; the shadow across the yard -- jumping up and down barking. I remember looking all around when it starte to move and I remember seeing the moon, and the shadow slowly moved off the patio down to the ground and the black circle moved slowly across the light colored sand.  I was walking behind it and I could see my shadow to my left - on the left side of the shadow.  The silent invisible round what-ever picked up speed, a perfect circle was right there to see and follow and I would have, but I was stopped by my fence.  I watched it grow larger as it slithered across the yard and into the street.  It was heading west north west.  And then my dog stopped barking and leaping into the air and the shadow that had been on my patio for no more than two or three minutes had moved up and away. Obviously when I first looked up at the full moon it wasn&apos;t there because the invisible round craft was between eleven and twelve o&apos;clock position in the night sky and it was blocking my direct line of sight.  It blocked the shape of the moon but the object in front of the moon gave itself away by casting a shadow on my patio.  And I think it was close, maybe 50- 80 feet over my head (?) and that is why my dog was leaping into the air trying to catch it --- it was close enough to his senses to &quot;leap up and catch.&quot;  I saw nothing but a round shadow on the ground and I saw nothing to be the cause. The sky looked bright and normal for a full moon out in the country.  No light pollution.   There was no sound except my dog barking and just one other thing.  When I went inside to get the tape measure, I noticed my five Koi were racing around their pond. As usual their covered porch, shades drawn, was in the dark and they should have been sleeping.  How did they know there was a noiseless invisible, shadow casting, intruder?

In the sky, slightly above Wilson Mountain, I observed an extremely bright white light, which appeared to be stationary.  The luminosity of this light was exceptional, and looked exactly like the white sparklers kids use on the 4th of July.  The light was radiating out from a central point, in brilliant sparkling rays, just like a sparkler.  The light also seemed to pulse a bit, getting bigger and brighter, and then dimmer and smaller.  I was almost transfixed by it, it was so  extraordinarily beautiful, and I did not want to leave my observation of it, but I did want a photograph, and so I went upstairs to get my camera and shoot from the outside balcony there. When I got upstairs the light was still there, but lower on the horizon, and closer to the top of the mountain.  My sense of it was that it would soon be gone, and I hurriedly grabbed my digital camera, went outside and observed it very close to the top of the mountain, and getting lower.  I took one shot, lowered my camera, and it was gone, so I do not know if I pressed the shutter in time, but my image is completely black, except for the wall of the balcony, which shows clearly.  This is unusual, because there was enough light in the sky so that the mountains should have been visible in the photo against the dawn sky,  but that area is completely black. Something else unusual is that I do take very many paranormal photographs in which I do not see the lights and shapes that appear in my photographs, but this time, I saw a mysterious light, and the landscape in the image is completely black.  There was no noise from the light.  I looked at the clock on my kitchen oven, and the time was exactly 5:00 a.m. This light was like nothing I have ever seen.  The color white was unparalled and pure, and it sparkled and radiated in such a way that it seemed to be intentionally wanting my attention.  That was the feeling I got from it, and I had a very hard time leaving it to go get my camera.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at Venus.

Military jets flying in the area.We were on a rafting trip and camped near Mule Creek Canyon at a place called the Rogue River Ranch.  There are no lights anywhere nearby so I was looking at stars with my binoculars.  We could hear military jets in the area as the echo was loud off the canyon walls.  I got back in my tent and was laying there looking out when I saw a large light in the sky above the tree line.  I could hear other campers say &quot;Did you see that?&quot;, so I jumped out of my tent with my binoculars.  The light was gone.  It had only lasted a few seconds.  But about a minute later a large round orange light came on suddenly just above the trees. It was the size of a nickel held at arm&apos;s length.  I looked at it through my binoculars and it was just a very bright light.  I couldn&apos;t make out any structure.  It disappeared after about 10 seconds.I could still hear a jet in the distance and followed the jet with my binoculars.  It was far away and many miles to the right of the light. All I could see was the red light on it&apos;s left wing as it made a huge sweeping turn to the left.The next morning people were talking about the lights and someone said he had seen three different lights within about ten minutes.  He thought it was the afterburner from the jets.  I don&apos;t know what afterburner would look like but for it to have been that big in the sky I would think the jet would have to be visible nearby with the binoculars.  The jet I saw was in a different part of the sky and very far away.", "Green bright light flashIn that day I was washing my car in my garden then i toke a short break,My mum and elder brother where next 2 me and we were trying 2 remove some old tree branches off the wall, when a stunning almost blinding green ray or some thing like a spot light crossed among us,for a while we kept quite?then we all looked at each other surprised of what had just happened?we knew there was nothing that could beam flash so bright in broad day light like that from above and so damn fast we couldnt even trace it in the sky?but an out of space object or some alian visetors.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

While travelling south on Interstate-5 in the central valley of California, at about 10:15 pm, we encountered the I-5 UFO phenomenon that has been reported to NUFORC several times since at least the year 2000.  It was a triangular aircraft flying a repetitive aerobatic pattern over the interstate and swooping down very low over traffic, creating a hazard to all who were driving.We saw it as we approached from 2 to 3 miles away, and were amazed at it&apos;s agility and audacity right from the start.  It occurred 28 miles north of Highway 198 at the intersection of I-5 and the overpass of Manning Avenue.  The aircraft&apos;s maneuvers were incredible, but not beyond human capability.  The craft flew a fast, distinct, unchanging pattern over the interstate and overpass, swooping down to an unbelievably low level over the freeway traffic.  We and every other vehicle around us slowed down to observe it, and once underneath it, we hoped we wouldn&apos;t get hit.  We drove past the overpass, which was remote and had no exit/entrance ramps and then parked on the shoulder about 100 yards south of it, right below the pattern that the aircraft was flying.  My wife and I tried hard to get a good look, but it was very dark; no moon and no city lights anywhere near us.The craft seemed to be triangular, yet not an equilateral triangle.  It was shaped more like a Vulcan bomber; the wings formed a wide delta, yet their leading edge intersected the fuselage well behind the nose.  I could not make out the profile of the nose, yet I could see the profile of a vertical tail fin.  The vertical height of the fuselage seemed thin, but not too thin for a human pilot.  It&apos;s lights were completely unconventional; no strobe, no red and green position lights, no navigation light.  It just had 3 big bright circular halogen white lights, about 12&quot;-18&quot; in diameter; one under the nose, and one at each wingtip.  The nose light would turn off and then turn back on.  They all shined down and forward about 45 degrees, and were built into the body; they weren&apos;t fixtures hanging down.  They put out an ambient glow onto the fuselage, which was a very pale tan or grey.  There were no other markings and no landing gear visible.  Unlike previous reports of this phenomenon to NUFORC, which described a silent craft, (and I don&apos;t discount them), this craft made a lot of noise.  In fact, it sounded like it had a single jet engine.  As it approached, it made a whining, hissing sound, which turned into a roar as it passed, yet not as loud or fast as a corporate or fighter jet.  The craft maintained a speed of about 80 to 100 mph throughout it&apos;s maneuvers.  A high-performance engine might explain how it made steep climbs and 90 degree banking turns without stalling or losing speed.It flew a repetitive kidney-bean shaped pattern above the freeway intersection with the overpass.  It dived down and flew 15&apos;-20&apos; above the I-5 traffic, climbed up, hung a U-turn, then dove down to the field on the east side of the interstate, and flew an amazing 2-3 feet above the ground for about 100 yards until it approached the embankment of the overpass, then pulled up and climbed at about 45 degrees without slowing down to about 200 feet above ground, hung a sharp U-turn banking at 90 degrees to the ground,then dove down again at the interstate, and repeated this pattern over and over.  Whether the pilot was an off-hours yahoo cropduster or an alien, he was out of his mind.  While parked on the shoulder, we watched the aircraft fly the pattern right over us several times before driving off (my 6 year-old daughter was getting scared).I wish I could provide a more definitive identification of the aircraft, but it was very dark that night and the craft was constantly making sharp moves: banking, climbing, and diving.  My best guess is that this was a powerful, unconventional, yet terrestrial airplane, but the pilot was performing maneuvers that weren&apos;t just bold, but crazy and malicious toward the traffic on I-5.  Everything about the aircraft&apos;s actions and lighting was illegal.I called the California Highway Patrol after driving away, and the dispatcher shrugged it off, saying, &quot;I&apos;ll put out a bulletin, but there&apos;s not much we can do.  You might want to try the FAA.&quot;  I&apos;ll forward this report to the FAA in the hopes that they might look into it, being that this incident constitutes crimes being committed with an aircraft.  Either this is some rogue cropduster that hasn&apos;t been caught yet, or this area along I-5 is definitely a UFO hotspot.((NUFORC Note:  High quality graphic of the flight path of the object above Interstate 5 is provided by the witness.

What is strange is that it didn&apos;t have any flashing lights like a plane. There is airplane traffic that does come from this direction at about this speed, but as they get closer you can see the nav lights.

Everyone there was of a rational mindset. In summary -- 8 of us saw something in the sky that we can&apos;t quite explain.  The idea of a balloon was (forgive the pun) floated but the object was far too stationary for that to be true.  Also, it should be noted that as the sun set, the object, suspended above the western horizon, remained consistently luminous -- a large white &quot;circloid&quot; with no noticable shading.

We were working on my computer there, so I had to connect it and get online when I got home. That&apos;s why it has been two and a half hours ago now. My friend lives in Wood River, Illinois and I decided to stop for gas in Highland. I took the exit onto Innerstate 70 headed east. I caught sight of this object to my right (south-east) as I reached the speed limit. I rolled down the passenger window to make sure I wasn&apos;t seeing a reflection or distortion in the glass. It looked the same. The object was illuminated in white light although it was somewhat dimmer than the full moon would be. It looked like a round tube standing on it&apos;s edge straight up and down. Like the core of a paper towel roll. Except this one had a ring that circled the entire object. Somewhat similar to the rings of Saturn if seen from beneath. The whole object was as big as a penny held at arm&apos;s length away and hovered 25 to 30 degrees off of the horizon. As I drove it seemed to float a little higher and lower in the sky but kept pace. I had my little camera with me so I decided to drive down to the next exit (Pokahontas) and pull off to try to get a picture. If nothing else but to prove something was actually there. I didn&apos;t want to stop on the innerstate on a late Saturday night/Sunday morning. The problem was it slowly started to fade away and by the time I got to the exit it was gone from view. I had my police scanner with me but no one I heard reported anything. Also I saw plenty of stars around so I don&apos;t think it was cloudy. After some rest I will attempt to send a drawing of what I saw. Hopefully it will be of help.

After about 3 or 4 minutes, I saw the original silver sphere moving the same direction (west) as I saw the day before.  I told my wife to come out and that it was back.  She saw it, I went in to get the binoculars to see it better.  She kept watch on it.  We both looked at it again magnified and it was silver and a sphere.  At that height, It was probably a little smaller than a jet flying at about 40,000 feet.  This time we didn&apos;t see any other objects like we did yesterday flying around it (see my report from yesterday). Then at once, it blinked out...gone.  There was no high cloud cover this time like there was the day before.  I still had the trees as a still reference.  I think the odds of seeing this thing twice in two days is really strange.

No bigger than the palm of a hand, we thought it was really interesting.

I watched it as it moved away from my position.  Then, after about 4 or 5 minutes, it went into a vertical climb at the same rate of speed.  I continued to watch for about one more minute until it disapeared into the cloud cover.  It made no noise and was not a recognizable craft.  It had no wings, lights, landing gear or propellers.  My closest explanation is that it was a 20 or 30 foot wide black balloon that travels at 60mph. At the risk of straining my credibility, I believe I saw this same object (or one very similar) three days prior, from my residence in south city Saint Louis at about 7:30 pm.  This object had the same shape and moved about 60mph in a South/southwestwardly direction.  I did not get as long a look at it before it moved behind some trees. I have never reported a UFO before.  I am almost 32, with a graduate degree and I have never taken drugs.  I am very used to seeing all kinds of aircraft in and around the city.

I was in Jr. High at the time of the event since i lived in Miami from 1972-1976 starting in the 5th grade so the 1975 approx date of numerous craft supports what i recall. My father was Director of ((deleted)) for the ((deleted/entertainment)) Company Headquartered in Miami Fl. He had bought a Morgan 25ft sailboat which he kept stored moored at a marinia on Key Biscayne Island (the same one President Nixon had his retreat on) We were all on my dad&apos;s boat to spend the night &amp; then to sail the next morning early due to tidal conditions i believe. That night present were myself(13), my brother(18) his best friend(18) my cousin from PA. who was attending the UofM(20) her roommate(unknown age) my mother(50) and my father(53)the boat only slept 5 internally so all the older kids were going to sleep outside on deck near the stern. I remember we were all sitting aft talking and it was dark, it&apos;s always darker when you are on the water and the miami skyline always twinkled and had an orange glow due to the city crime lights they used on the street lamps. Now we were all used to seeing the planes that buzzed the beach towing the makers and the tourist helo&apos;s that took ppl for joy rides and even the Goodyear blimp, but what we saw that night was most definetly not of this world.I don&apos;t recall who noticed it 1st, but we all got to watching a single light that seemed to move very slowly at 1st &amp; then stop, starting from the South Miami area and moved in the direction of North Miami/Hollywood, at 1st their was only 1, then 2 then 3, soon we had a hard time keeping count, these objects would start out white &amp; then change to orange and sometimes pulsing. At times their would be 7 in one area and another 3 in another spot further to the north. These objects would almost increase their radiating light intensity and then slowly almost fade  and in some cases just disappear only to reappear in a different location either north or south of their original position. We took turns looking at them thru binoculars, they were orange with a black hexogonal line pattern on them, but seemed not to have an outer edge due to the glow. I remember getting a frightening chill down my back while looking at them. As i recall, at the peak, there were upwards of 18 of these objects at one time, most centered in the area of the Miami International airport. The event lasted along time, i&apos;d say 20-30 mins at a minimum. During our experience, our flashlights would not work nor our radio, i also remember my dad pointing out how our magnetic compass was just wildly spinning. It was weird, all we could do was sit &amp; watch and i felt so small &amp; helpless. I also recall that the next day in the Miami Herald a story about them was printed because the airport had had to be shut down because these things interfeared with the landing of planes and that they had shown up on radar at the airport, i also remember my mother telling me that 2 fighter jets had been scrambled from Homestead Airforce base to intercept these objects (which i can only assume showed up on their radar) and that when the fighter jets got close, they all disappeared(which would explaine the end of our experience).I am ((in my forties)) now &amp; a father, i served in the U.S. Navy as an Operations Specialist ((technical field)) for almost 8 years and held a Secret clearance. I spent many months at sea looking at the night sky without man made interfearence and i have never seen anything like this remotely similar. These objects moved too fast for conventional means and were not man made objects, i&apos;ll take that to my grave. I to have also looked for similar accounts of this incident on the web, but have yet so far been unable to locate such info. I hope that my corroboration of seeing this event gives the other report on this the creedence it deserves.I swear on my family name and as a man that the above account is turthful &amp; honest to the best of my ability.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The earliest reports I heard were 9am in the morning and it was there until dark.I personally did not hear about it until around 6pm in the evening when a small blurb was mentioned on the radio. The object drifted slowly but not very far while under my observations and exhibited no unusual characteristics that one would expect if this were a high-altitude research balloon. The meteorologists from the local TV stations said that it was above the cirrus clouds indicating an altitude greater than 30,000.  This would make the object VERY big indeed. A local person with a high-powered telescope viewing it said it did indeed look like a balloon. Perhaps that would satisfy most people&apos;s questions, but how does an untethered balloon stay in basically the same position for at LEAST 12 hours in a row?  Especially in the Midwest where fronts are blowing through every few days?  Perhaps it was the center of a very slow moving low pressure system?

This light was bright, and it was hanging in the air in line with the 30 St Mary Axe building in the city. I am familiar with the daily and nightly flow of helicopters and planes in this area, and this light did not look like either one of those normal types of air traffic, which is why I took notice of it. I have lived in the same place for over 15 years, and I know the sky here. This light was was motionless and oddly colored, without strobes. I grabbed my telescope and took a look at it out of curiosity. At full magnification, it appeared to have three lobes in an equilateral triangle configuration, each one being an orange color. Whilst I viewed it, the three lights dimmed to nothing. The whole event lasted five minutes for me. From where I live (more or less Sloane Square), I can see the Post Office Tower, the London Eye and the top of 30 St Mary Axe, as well as the top of Canary Wharf, in that order from left to right. I could not tell precisely how far away it was, but I imagine that it must have been hanging over the city of London, judging by my familiarity with my telescopes zoom. From where I was observing, it was presenting at approximately 10deg above the horizon or less, at a guess, 5 times higher than 30 St Mary Axe. As for its size, all That I can say is that I distinctly saw three lobes at maximum magnification, which is 60X on a Bauch &amp; Lomb Discoverer Zoom Telescope.

It is about 300 yards straight in front of us but slightly higher, we can see its lights, like windows, or engines?

We knew that was a story because it sure wasn&apos;t floating now even though there was a small breeze. What&apos;s more it was the size of a bus not a weather balloon.Close to 1pm the object slowly moved straight upwards a little and then a little more. There was no noise but I felt the energy of it. It then moved very rapidly straight up to I guess maybe 1000 meters,slowed and then shot off at great speed straight up into the blue sky where it disappeared from sight.The powers-that-be kept pushing the weather balloon story which didn&apos;t fit the facts. I know of course that they can&apos;t say it&apos;s a flying saucer, else the whole country would go into a panic. I Think half the people believed the story and the other half, like me, knew it was a UFO.", "broken trangular patterned lightsI saw three craft which I assumed to be aircraft flying above and to the side of the football stadium.  I heard a friend who was sitting at the top of the stadium talking loudly and I looked in his direction.  My eyes were drawn above the top seats of the stadium, where I saw three craft flying in a V shaped formation.  I thought little of it since there is an Air Force base near the school and I have seen airplanes fly out of the base under cover of darkness and escorted by quiet helicopters before.  Later on I began asking people who are familiar with military aircraft if they had seen or were aware of the type of aircraft I had seen that night.  They all said no.  The craft were different than anything I had ever seen before in that they seemed to be flying at a speed and height comparable to a regular aircraft when approaching for landing, made absolutely no noise, and had lights which moved around the bottom of each craft in a broken triangular pattern.   The lights were white.  I saw no landing type lights in areas where I would expect wings to be.  I could not see a definite shape to the crafts, only the shape of the lights.  I am curious whether anyone else has seen aircraft similar to these/this, with lights in a broken triangular pattern on the bottom.  Do we have military aircraft with these types of lights?((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I live on the eastern edge of Reno, along the Virginia mountain range. A few commercial planes in the sky, as I&apos;m about two miles east of Reno Tahoe Intl Airport. But coming from the northwest was a strange thing. Two reddish blinking lights seemingly connected, but at a distance that would fit maybe four commercial planes between them. No sound, either with or following the pair of lights. I *think* I could make out dim stars between the lights, but I&apos;m not sure. It covered the sky at a lazy speed. (One commercial jet was at about 7,000 feet moving in for the landing loop they do from the south, and the jet was moving faster. Reno is at 4,500 feet elevation.)  This was a weird one. I guess it could&apos;ve been some sort of military jets flying at very high altitude in perfect time with each other, but if so I&apos;ve never seen such jets before. (We&apos;ve got a big Naval Air base about an hour away, and every now and then we see/hear a fighter jet over Reno.)  I watched it for the second half of the walk around our very long rural block, and stood outside my house watching as it disappeared over the Virginia range. It appeared to be *huge.* And, to clarify the direction in case anybody else saw this thing, it went from the northwest to the southeast. (Not a satellite -- we have a pretty clear sky here and enjoy watching the space station when it comes over our part of the world, especially in the summer when my family is out on the deck.) A pair of blinking aircraft-style lights, but very erratic in the flashing. I held my hand up and the distance between the lights was about four fingers wide.

He was sniffing the garbage cans &amp; such, as tomorrow is garbage day. I&apos;m sorry I didn&apos;t get a picture. It wouldn&apos;t have been much of a picture from our cheapo digital camera, but anyway it was headed over the mountains as I got back to the house. I&apos;ve seen one thing previously that might have been a &quot;UFO.&quot; That was about three-and-a-half years ago with my wife, driving up the 395 between L.A. and Tahoe.

Earlier today, I decided to take advantage of sunny conditions to go work outside, so I took my notebook computer out to the back patio and set it up. Although the day had started clear, thunderclouds started building up before noon. Much of the sky to the north was cloudy, but the sky to the south was clear. The stormclouds were well defined. There wasn&apos;t much overcast or haze, just stormcloud or clear blue sky. I need to take frequent breaks when working on the computer outside, because of glare on the display. So, at one point, I leaned back and looked straight up into the sky. I noticed that there was a very well defined thundercloud to the north, scattered cloud overhead and blue sky west and east. Directly overhead, there was what looked like a smoke ring, about the size of my thumbnail held at arm&apos;s length. It was perfectly circular and appeared to be swirling inward on itslelf. In the centre of the smoke ring was a grey dot or small circle. At first, the dot was almost as large as the area inside the smoke ring, about the size of a fingernail at arm&apos;s length.

In fact one of the points (it appeared as if it was the mother ship or so) was moving slower than the rest wish stopped moving suddenly till the slowest arrived close to them and  disappeared together in the sky.This happened in three minutes and what made this too serious that I was not alone my friend also noticed that minute by minute from the beginning.Note: I decided to inform you once I get your website on the net.

At first I thought it was someones spotlight, but suddenly realized that it was much larger as it broke into a beam of light projecting down into the city. I pulled over and got out to see what the heck this was all about and it was absolutely silent. No sound from the City, no barking dogs, not any noise.It was wierd, so quiet. I thought what can that be? Is it a large light that the carnivals used to use to shine a light beam up into the sky to attract people? As I studied this light, it rose above the horizon of the mountain top and I could see stars below it, so I know it was not a land based object. After a few minutes, it receded back to itself and vanished. All that remained in that location of the nite sky was a bit of fog looking stuff which slowly disipated. At that moment, all sound returned. The sounds of the city and freeway traffic far off, and closer was dog barking, lots of dogs barking all around at all the homesites in the foothills. The hair on my arms stood up and I chilled all over. After thinking more about what I saw, I realized that the size of that object was huge and the beam of light did not simply turn on and off, but projected (visually extended and retracted like a telescope ). Certainly not the speed of light. I am reporting this because I just ran across your site for the first time and never knew there was a place to report the incidence. I am having chill bumps just reliving the experience. What ever that thing was, it controlled sound and was silent itself.The light beam that it projected was a different light than I have ever seen, it was thick and intensly luminous even though it source had to have been at least two or more miles away.

Here is a video I took of it... www.kevinandtammy.net/video/ufo.asx  The video causes the object to appear smaller than it did to the naked eye.

Upon learning of the object and hearing that it may be a weather balloon, I phoned work to find out what the upper winds were doing.  From the mid levels up to 60,000ft the winds were steady out of the west at 60 knots.  Had the object in the sky been a balloon I would think it would have drifted in the direction of the wind.

She also claims that once it hit all the windows and car alarms were set off and they were momentarily blinded. Everyone in the neighborhood was scared and went back to thier homes to find out what was going on. They turned on the t.v. and radio; waited and to their suprise there was no news about what just had occured. Two days later people were calling in radio station to find out if anyone else had seen or heard what was going on. The people from the radio station &quot;Real Radio 104.1&quot; actually sent someone to investigate. They went to the location where people reported seeing and hearing the object fall from the sky. The military was there and so was Nasa. They also fenced up the hole that was in the ground . They also reported seeing Military Hummer going in and out.To my knowledge no reporter from newspapers or television have come to the site.

As it passed above me, where the sky was clear, craft rapidly de-cellerated at the same time changing shape (2 curved points appeared at opposite sides of craft during de-celleration). The craft made an S turn starting with a turn right, then left, then right again. As it made this last right turn, it rapidly accelerated out of sight travelling west.

I noticed that there were no other cars on Ramon at that time.

I pointed it out to three others, my son, daughter-in-law, and friend.  We watched it for about two minutes as it continued North.  It was travelling at about 4 to 5 times the speed of a jetliner and zig-zagged erratically from side to side.  It was brilliant, brighter than the stars and any other object in the sky.  It was not an aircraft. After it moved from view we saw a satellite pass overhead.  The satellite was a small fraction of the brightness of this object.  I have practiced law for 24 years.  The others with me were all between 30 and 50 years of age.

Just gliding (floating) side by side. They would slow down and speed up. And when one would get to far away from the other it would stop until the other one would catch up. Almost like they were attatched together by a string. I know they were pretty small because at that time a low flying jet passed by and they were about as big as its cockpit. This lasted a good while. But then I lost them in the clouds. Were they weather ballons or something else, I have no idea.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

As I got in the car, he asked me if I could see the odd lights in the sky from where I was in my front yard. I live out in the country, so I had to drive down my little road a ways to get past the trees. I looked over the western portion of the sky and saw two bright white lights and a smaller pulsating one that changed color. It was moving very, very slowly. At first I thought it was a military plane going from Altus AFB, OK to Fort Sill, OK as they are wont to do from time to time. But, you can hear those planes for miles and they usually fly in 3&apos;s. This object made no sound that I could hear. I was 1 mile off the main highway and I can assure you, it was dead still outside. I pulled over in the drive of a cow field and watched it. It moved like it was hovering over something. The two white lights would get dim and then insanely bright for no reason. The object got closer to me as I watched it. I could make out a triangle-type outline to it and noticed it had 3 white circular lights on each &quot;point&quot; of the triangle. It seemed to zig-zag in the sky very slowly and would &quot;hover&quot; or stop completely at times. By this time, I was a little scared and told my friend I was going to drive out to where he was so we could watch it together. As I was driving, it sped up some and when I arrived at my destination it had all but disappeared after a sudden burst of speed.

As I began to move away from the eye piece, so he could have another look, I saw 3 triangular objects move directly through the middle of my field of view toward the west.  With this telescope the moon almost fills the field of view.  With a bright and almost full moon as a background the objects appeared to be black.  They passed by the moon in about one second.  Right through the middle of the moon.  They seemed to be very far away from us.  But I can&apos;t be sure of that.  I immediately looked up with my naked eye but couldn&apos;t see anything.  No lights, nothing.  They seemed to be exactly the same distance from each other.  Similar to the way figher jets fly in formation.  I&apos;ll try to give an example of their size.  If you have a grapefruit, then take 3 peas (pretend they are triangular shaped peas) and make a triangle with them in the middle of the grapfruit and separate them by about 1/4 inch then you would understand the size and the relationship between the 3 objects that I saw through the telescope.

It was about 75 degrees from the horizon and moving from North to South.  I turned off my computer monitor, as it was the only light in the room, and stuck my head out the window to get a better look at the object as it passed nearly over my position.  The object was 3 or 4 times the size of a star and glowed dimly but steadily.  Unlike the many planes and helicopters that can be viewed from the sweeping views of my east-facing windows, this object had no blinking lights from any visible angle and made no sound. It did not twinkle, like a star and was far too large to be a satellite.  It was about 1/3 the size of my pinky nail held at arms length.  It did not really emit light, but rather had just a dim luminosity. The roundish shape of the object and its glow appeared the same as it approached my position from the north, passed over and continued on toward the south.  Before passing out of my line of sight to the south, the object made a sweeping curve toward the west appearing to gain elevation during the curve.

If you see what I am looking at, you will believe in UFO&apos;s&quot; but she did not bother to get up.

You can plainly see that they are in between the helicopter and traffic that was backed up from the accident on the ground.  You can also tell that they are traveling over at least 75 mph, because they are going faster that the traffic on the highway below.

We were to young, or naive, at the time to be overly concerned.  We were excited at first, curious and playful as we watched it move.  But our &quot;child&rsquo;s perception&quot; kicked in as we playfully skipped from streetlight to streetlight... and when dusk caused those streetlights to come on, we realized the object &quot;seemed&quot; to move with us (child&rsquo;s perception).  We then began to get frightened and ran from street light to streetlight until we got back to my Aunt&apos;s house, at which point we immediately told my Aunt that we had seen something.  As we talked we all saw the object through the kitchen window.  We all watched it until my Aunt became nervous and closed the drapes (about 5-7 minutes -- I cannot recall which direction the kitchen window faced, but I believe it may have been S.W. as I remember my aunt&apos;s back yard always having sun in the afternoons).  She then got each of us a piece of paper and pencils/crayons, put us in different rooms, and told us (including herself) to draw what we had seen.  When she gathered us all back in the kitchen and compared our drawings... they were all exactly alike.  My memory of the object isn&apos;t that clear these days, but I do remember the object having a domed upper portion, flat bottom, numerous lights of multiple colors circling the lower edge, that dimmed and brightened, but never went completely out.  The object also emitted an odd humming sound.  I&apos;m not sure why I&apos;ve chosen this time to finally report this incident; perhaps it is the sudden rash of &quot;ufo&quot; programming that has cycled back on to all the TV networks and book store shelves that has prompted me to take the chance of reporting it.

I thought that it might just be a planet that had come close to earth&apos;s orbit, since it was so big and colored kind of red like mars, but it was flickering. I slowed down to get a good look at it, but then I realized the object was moving! I really slowed down and pulled off to the side of the road where I sat and watched the object slowly float over me. I sat there trying to figure out what the object was exactly, as it really looked like someone lit a campfire and sent it into the air. The strange thing was that I could see something flapping in the wind on top of the fire. I really though that it might be a home-made hot air balloon(not one that anyone could travel in, more like the type where you get a large sack and light a fire under it and attach the fire in some sort of way. As the heat rises beneath the sack from the fire, the object begins to float and rises away), but the object was getting higher and higher and not running out of fuel. The object was about 1000 feet into the air when I first saw it. I got back in my car and drove home (less than 2 minutes away), but kept an eye on the object the whole way home. I pulled into my driveway and watched it. By this time, the object could have been 1500-2500 feet up. Here is the rather peculiar thing about the object though-- when it was extremely high, it sort of changed shape from being a firey orb to being a sort of elongated ember looking thing. You could tell the fire was dieing down because it changed from a yellow fire to looking like red burning embers, but very bright, but then it started shooting off red sparks/glowing balls. 2 of the glowing balls shot off even more smaller balls, and all of these glowing balls flew around rapidly.

Third incident among my group of friendsme and two of my friends were out at lowville park and we were watching shooting stars. I was tying my shoes when my friend saw a shooting star which he described as being very big and very bright.He pointed in the direction at which the object disapeared behind the tree line. We then noticed a glowing starlike object peaking thru the tree line. This object then slowly hovered higher above the tree line(about 1 thumb length) and hovered there.it slowly began moving left to right , and up and down. the object was a solid glowing light and appeared to have no flashing lights that a helicopter or a plane would have.We also noticed, now that adreniline had our night vision at max, a vapour trail that my friend said was the path of the &quot;shooting star&quot; that he saw. This trail was in a spiral shape. I tried calling my friend to get him out there with his video camera because we were watching it for a half hour and at this point the obect was stationary and appeared to be going nowhere.my friend said he had no tape for his camera, so i called a girl in hamilton who i knew had a camara.she too had no film but told me she could seefrom here balcony and that it was so bright she could only stare for so long.she also told me that her cat was out on the balcony crying with itz tail between itz legs. After that we followed this object and it appeared to be slowly moving towards lake ontario, and we continued watching it as it went higher andf higher.....finally at about 7:30 am, its was broad daylight and this object could still be seen going higher and higher into the sky until it disapeared. I have friends who have seen these objects on 2 seperate ocassions but i never believed them. they too saw them at lowville park.one of them guessed what time this happened to us because he too said that his animal ran into his room crawling and crying with itz tail between itz legs at the time that it passed over the city towards the lake. we also noticed various birds flying north in v patterns away from this obeject. this has led me to believe that whatever propels these spacecraft, it must give off a high pitched sound that only animals can detect, much like a dog whistle. I also believe they can be seen thoughout the month more than once and that there is a connection to these lights and lowville park because of the numerous sightings", "Two UFO&apos;s chase each other in Bronx, NYCIt occurred one night, the exact year , month and time are approximates, around 2-3 am and I went out to the front of my home to let my dog outside .

The lights were white in color, and in a V pattern.  I stood up because the lights were moving very fast, and I was going to loose sight of it.

As I watch trying to think what I was looking at, it moved straight to the west (right) without any wing tip or signal.  It was as if it was going forward then just moved to the right without stopping.  I just said what the hell, still trying to make something out of what I was seeing.  The lights then began going out as if the object had some thickness.  The problem with this I couldn&rsquo;t see the object.  This I can explain, after all it was very dark and if the object were black I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see it in the dark sky.  This incident only took a few seconds and the object moved very fast.

As I looked around through the scope, I could see animal eyes, deer, coyotes, rabits, etc., glowing in the dark from the IR light source.  Then I decided to look up into the moonless night sky.  I turned off the IR. Now and then I could see an airliner moving high overhead.  To idintify the airliner, I looked at it with the Starlight Scope (2.5 X) and then noticed I could see the flashing nav. light.  Without the scope it was difficult to see the flashing nav. light.A few minutes later, almost straight overhead I noticed another dot of light moving west.  When I examined this light there was no flashing nav. light.  At first I thought it was a satilite, however, the dot of light changed direction and proceeded somewhat south then east, then back west to a point about 50 degrees off the horizon. I constantly checked this dot with my Starlight Scope and still no flashing nav. light. The dot of light then remained locked in position with the stars and slowly dimmed out.

I was scared an asked my uncle if it was a plane, and he said no it had way to many lights to be a plane. I got really nervous and was shaking all over my heart was pounding so fast.

CST I noticed a very odd phenomenon  over Interstate 90/94 southbound between Poynette, WI and DeForest, WI.  My wife and I were driving home from central Wisconsin from a friends cottage.  No alcohol or drugs were consumed at the outing. It was a very clear night and the stars were very visible. My wife and I both noticed a bright white light in the sky.  She asked what it was and I responded jokingly, a UFO.  It was extremely bright and was composed of four lights in a row flying perpendicular to our line of travel.  At first we thought they must be landing lights on an airliner.  However the four lights in a row were not right.  Usually there is some separation between the lights. There was none.  Between us and the lights there was a microwave tower with a red light on it,  the lights appeared miles beyond the tower.  We passed the tower in about a quarter to half mile.  Then the lights started to descend.  I thought it might be a plane landing at the Dane county airport a few miles to the south.  But it wasn&apos;t turning toward the airport as it should have.  It proceeded straight across the highway about what initially looked to be about a quarter mile ahead of us.  It then came down very steeply and I though it was going to crash in the woods next to the highway.  Instead the lights dropped in intensity until it looked about the size of a flashlight.  It then winked out and appeared to land on the shoulder of the road directly to our right.  When it winked out it was the size of a computer keyboard and appeared to fly into the woods next to the road.  It was not a bird.  We could not stop as it was a crowded interstate and had a steep ditch next to the road.  We proceeded home to Madison and I filed this report.  It was definitely an Unconventional Flying Object.", "Disk Shaped Craft Hovering over Farm((name deleted/male)) sighting occurred during the summer of 1975 within a few miles of his home in Ramsey, MN (25 miles Northwest of Minneapolis.) He was 13 years old at the time and was on his way to the ((deleted)) Church with his two sisters around 6:30PM. As his oldest sister was driving North on Anoka County Road 5 they all noticed cars pulled over to the shoulder on each side of the road near the 167th Avenue NW intersection. Fearing an accident had occurred she slowed the vehicle down as they neared the intersection. However, to their surprise, no cars seemed to be damaged and the occupants of the parked vehicles were standing outside gazing up into the Western sky. Just about the time they passed the crossing, ((witness)) looked out his passenger window and saw what appeared to be a large disk shaped craft which he estimated to be around the size of 2 Rambler homes (250-300&apos; in diameter.) It appeared to be about a half mile away near a farm and estimated about 160&apos; in the air. He became very afraid and began screaming at his sister to turn around, get out of there and head back home. His sister obliged when they also saw the craft and turned around the vehicle. To his dismay however, they stopped the vehicle and got out to get a better look along with the 5-10 other vehicles now lining the shoulder. As they watched, the craft hovered for what seemed like 1-2 minutes and made no sound. Suddenly in an instant it moved about 2 miles South and stopped for a few more seconds before disappearing out of sight toward the Anoka area. After the object departed, ((name delted)) again begged his sisters to get back into the car and go home. They did and upon entering their house, told their parents the story. After calming ((witness))  down and discussing the object, the eldest sister called the Ramsey Police Department to see if any one had reported the sighting. The dispatcher confirmed that other callers had also reported seeing the unusual craft in the same area during the same time frame.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Its location being approximately 270 degrees mag. from our position, 10-15 degrees above the horizon, distance unknown but I would say at least 20 miles. After 30 seconds from the initial sighting the bright orange light started to move in a northerly direction and gain altitude while simultaneously separating in to two dimmer white lights. The lights stayed in this configuration for another 60 seconds. Its heading was aprox. 25 degrees mag. so the lights were getting closer to us during this time. We were driving at the time, making it difficult to determine speed of the lights.Never the less, they moved faster than commercial aircraft viewed at similar distances. At this time the two dimmer white lights converged and once again became a single bright orange light while continuing on same heading.  About 15-20 seconds later the light vanished.  Its last visual location was 340 degrees mag. from our location,  45 degrees above the horizon and still 10 miles distant. I can say, absolutely, as I&apos;ve been exposed to many commercial, military, and civilian aircraft during daylight as well as nighttime conditions, that I have never seen aircraft lights behave as these did.

Just before it reached the clouds it morphed instantly from a &apos;dome&apos; shape into a &apos;diamond wedge&apos; and seem to become more transparent, disappearing into the clouds all together.

Then I noticed it moving back and forth (the lights would get brighter and dimmer) and side to side.  I knew it wasn&apos;t a star, and it could not be an aircraft because the side to side movement was fast enough not to match any aircraft speeds.  As I continued to watch, an airplane off in the distance kinda near it went by, which it then fadded so that i could no longer see it.  Then it reappeared after the airplane past by it.  It continued to move back and forth, and side to side, and I lost track of the lights as it went closer down to the horizon where the trees obstructed my vision.  The erratic movement and the fading of a single light, (possible more than one light) also the duration of 30 minutes of which I observed, is what lead me to truely beleive that it was an UFO.

I awoke at 5:00 am on Wednesday, July 29, 2004.  I observed the large bright orb in the eastern sky over the San Jacinto Mountains that I have been observing over the past several days.  It only appears sometime between 3:00 and 5:00 am.

I continued to watch the sky and as I did, 3 more orbs approached (smaller than the two already in sight) and lined up vertically between the two larger colored orbs.  As I watched, the large white orb slowly ascended higher into the sky as well as the colored orbs.  I know they are ascending slowly because the mountains are my scale, they appear initially just over the mountain and as the hour goes by, they slowly ascend upwards until they disappear into the sky.

There were approximately 10-20 of us all around the area. It&apos;s been more than 10 years, so I&apos;ll do my best at decribing what I can remember. I only just found this site today (07/19/04). I was living in Sedona at the time, and my friends and I loved to go hiking whenever we could. We had heard many stories of UFO&apos;s, but most there had never witnessed any personally. A couple of my closest friends and I were inside the van which was parked at the top of Shnebley (sp?)or as close as we could get. There was a sort of pseudo rocky parking lot which we used as a &quot;base&quot;. I don&apos;t remember the exact time, but it was near dusk and I was inside the van with a few friends. All of a sudden someone pulled open the sliding door and screamed, &quot;you&apos;ve got to come see this....there are some strange things going on out here!&quot;  So, of course, we all piled out and walked to the end of the &quot;parking lot&quot;, looking towards the major rock formations directly across from us (I can&apos;t remember the name of the certain formation now). They were all pointing across the way to what looked like two black helicoptors which were looking like they were &quot;guarding&quot; either side of this strange rock formation. This is so hard to explain, I wish I could remember the name of the rock...you&apos;d know exactly how it was set up.WEll, just then, the middle flat front face of this rock formation all of a sudden disappeared while the black helicoptors just &quot;stood guard&quot; on either side of the &quot;cave&quot; and UFO&apos;s stared flying out of the new formed &quot;cave&quot;. The UFO&apos;s were fling very erraticly, hard to count or follow a certain one. They continued to zip about until all were out of the &quot;cave&quot;. Then in a flash they were here, then there, then zap! gone! no where to be seen! Then, the rock face closed back up and the black helicoptors waited a few minutes and took off. All of us were stunned, needless to say. We didn&apos;t know what to think and all of us had our own descriptions of what we saw, but we all agreed that we had witnessed something none of us could explain. All of us all felt an unnatural &quot;buzzing&quot; like a different frequency disturbing the area. During the next few months of living there, I encountered many sightings of black helicopters, strange stories of &quot;government men in black&quot; turning away hikers in certain areas and caves, and even a strange underground explosion, or earthquake, or something...(none who were with me ever heard anything in the news about an earthquake or explosion underground in the Sedona area). I still don&apos;t know exactly what we all saw, but it was definitely something all of us witnessed that we had never before imagined or could deny.", "The light chased us.It was a winter night in maybe the year 1973 or 74. There where four of us boy&apos;s out coon hunting in a group of tree&apos;s that has a boy scout camp in it call Camp Boonee. There was four of us hunting that night Ed, his younger brother Mike and Randy and myself we had I think 3 or 4 coondog&apos;s with us and where just getting into the hunt. We had ran the dog threw the wood&apos;s of Camp Boonee and where going to cross Hudson Rd and go to the east side of the road to another small group of tree&apos;s to hunt a bit. It was when we got some twenty to thirty feet to the edge of the road when a very bright white light came on up in the sky somewhere just above the tree top&apos;s. It was very bright and lit up the ground and the tree&apos;s cast shadow&apos;s on the ground and if you look right at the light it would hurt you&apos;r eye&apos;s to do so. Well this scared us all and we ran a way&apos;s westward back into the thicker part of the tree&apos;s for cover and when we did so the light went out. We all stoped in a group and where looking around to see where the light might of gone but could&apos;nt see it anymore. So we all continued west with the ideal of coming out on the west side of the tree&apos;s and then circle back to the east along the north side and come back to Hudson Rd then head back north on the road and go back to Hudson and go home. But as we got close to the west side of the tree&apos;s the light again came on above and in front of where we where, scaring us again and we all ran back into the thicker part of the tree&apos;s for cover once again. And while we all where running for cover the light went out and when we stop in the center of the tree&apos;s to take a look around we could&apos;nt see it. So we all just crouched down and waited a while looking and listening, trying to figure out where the light had gone. It was while we where all crouched down around this big old cottonwood tree looking around for this light we then saw it come on and shine down to the gound some few hundered feet to the south and east of where we where. Did it think m! aybe it had found us or maybe one of our dog&apos;s or some other animal? Well after about half a minute of so the light went out and we couldnt tell where it had gone. After setting there for maybe twenty or thirty minute&apos;s or so but what seemed to be all night we all got up and went threw the tree&apos;s to the north and east and then came to the road and fallowed it north back to town and all went to our home&apos;s. After thinking about this some year&apos;s later it is still a mystery to me. The light that shone down on us that night was very much brighter than any kind of spotlight that I have ever seen, it was almost as bright as if the sun was shining in just a small beam of light some fourty feet around when it struck the ground. It would hurt you&apos;r eye&apos;s to look right at it for very long. One might think that maybe it was some spotlight or bright flashlight from some other hunter&apos;s or some farmer looking to see who might be in there tree&apos;s, or even someone just playing a joke on some kid&apos;s in the night. But I don&apos;t think so, for Hudson is a very small town and we all know everyone and would know if someother hunter&apos;s would be out that night. And there is the fact of where the light had shown down from. It was well above the tree&apos;s coming down on a slant so that if a person was behind the light they would have to have some way to be up above the tree&apos;s and then move from one place to another all without being seen or heard, for all the while this was going on there was no sound from the light. It was a calm clear night with no wind at all. And the only sound&apos;s we heard that night was of ourself&apos;s runing threw the tree&apos;s and our out of breath voice&apos;s from the running and fear. And there is the ideal when I have told other&apos;s before about this and they sugest that maybe the light or who was shining the light where up on a tower or pole or something? But there are no towers or pole&apos;s for someone to be up on at all just the tree&apos;s. And on the west side where once the light came down from, beyond the tree&apos;s is just open feild&apos;s for mile&apos;s to the west and nothing that one could get up on to shine the light from. It was not a spotlight from any car or plane or helicopter, for there was no sound at all from any type of machine. Just a light that chased us. The time from when the light first shown down on us to the time where we all came out on the road to go home was maybe a little less than a hour I think but who know&apos;s for! shure it could of be much longer.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

In Septemebr of 2003 I was setting up my telescope to view Mars and noticed out of the corner of my eye something moving above the trees. I quickly turned and saw a craft, not a plane, bird, satellite, helicopter, or ballon. It was no more than 300 feet above me (a large 70 foot live oak tree is in my backyard that I used for reference) It was dark in color with a whitish canopy.  The craft was  2 or 3 times the trees height, and estimated to be about 75 feet across moving about 30-40 mph.  It flew above the tree and along the dividing line that separates my backyard and my neighbors backyard (my neighbors backyard abuts my backyard). The craft made no noise, had no lights, nor wings. Most decernible was a black circular bottom with a white circle on the outter edge of the botton disc, it reminded me of a &quot;white wall tire&apos; as it flew quitley from north to south on a straight trajectory.  Oddly enough there is a high voltage station and accompanying high voltage lines down from me on my street and hight voltage lines along the street behind me, the craft seen traveling along the backyards seemed to be driving right between the two streets where the lines are located perhaps &quot;absorbing the energgy field?..Is this craft some type of new military technology?

Objects were solid white approximatly the size of a small to medium star.  Objects maintained perfect formation but moved in jerky motion in unison. Stars could be seen between the objects maintaining that these were three separate craft.  Lead craft was the point of the triangle (opposite of triangular formation seen in New Jersey) . No noise (very quiet night!) One witness claims a beam was seen passing between the objects occasionally. Size and brightness was about that of the middle three stars of Cassiopia.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the objects were the three satellites that have been reported during August 2004.

Extremely frightening experience as i walked the perimeter of a field close to my house with the dog the object caught my eye, as i live right beside Glasgow airport here in Scotland my first thought was that this was just an aeroplane until i looked again, taking it in for about 1 minute until it flashed along the sky in a way that is hard to explain, it was there, then it was about 20 feet to the west, then another twenty and then it was gone. It wasn&apos;t a constant motion, it was like blinking. Im usually a rational person and have never believed in anything like alien life, nor am i religious in any way, but after thinking about this for a couple of hours i can&apos;t put any explanation to it. It was so close to me and so large. Tonight i&apos;m not going to sleep, too scared. My wife says she wants to believe me but she says she&apos;d have to see it for herself, but i know what i saw and this thing wasnt anything man made, the material it was made of looked like skin, its still vivid in my minds eye. ((name deleted)), Paisley, near Glasgow, Scotland.", "Very odd Flying-V object flew directly over me.This is the second report I have submitted to your site. My first report is dated 10/24/73. But I had seen something a few years before that. This sighting occured on July 4th, but I am not completely sure of the year. I was around 15 years old, which would have been 1969. At that time I lived in Jacksonville Beach, Fl. which is located on the Atlantic Ocean. Every year on the 4th of July my town would have a spectacular fireworks display, better than many large cities. They would shoot the fireworks out over the ocean. Huge crowds would gather every year, sometimes as many as 100,000 people. It was near dark and I went out in my driveway to look at the sky. If it was dark enough, I was going to walk down to the beach to see the display. The sun had either gone down or was behind the distant treeline, but it was still fairly light. As I was looking up I saw a very strange Flying-V object. It had 4 or 5 bright red flares on each side connected by what appeared to be narrow black tubes. It was flying the way you would expect a V shaped object would, with the point going first. The flares looked like the red flares you often see on the 4th of July that glow brightly and float down slowly. The little tubes were narrow and very black. It reminded me of Tinker-Toys when you connect those round wood shapes with the longer rods they provide you. This object was very low in the sky. I would estimate it was only 100 feet high at most. It flew directly over my head, heading due North. This object did not look large at all. I would estimate its wingspan at maybe 8-10 feet. Somehow it reminded me of a box-kite. It also made a &quot;sizzling&quot; sound, sort of like when you fry bacon. Also, faint wisps of black smoke were floating off the flares. I would estimate this object was traveling at 15-20 miles per hour. I could see it plain as day. At first I thought it was some sort of new firework that I had never seen before. But it was strange. I could not figure out what was making it move through the sky. It was not shooting fire out the back or anything like that. And the faint smoke coming from it was not shooting backward like a form of propulsion, but just floating away from the red flare balls. I continued to watch this object, expecting it to eventually descend. But it did not. It maintained a steady altitude and speed. That was what really got to me. It just kept on going. I knew no firework could do that. I continued to watch this object until it sailed out of sight to the north. I watched it for at least 2-3 minutes and it never did come down. Finally it grew so small and disappeared from my view. This object did not scare me like other objects I would see years later. It did not appear to be a craft that could be manned. It was just these balls and rods. It had no body to it at all. But it was under some type of control.", "I saw a metallic, saucer shaped,  buzzing and very visible saucer at a short distanceI was in Grade 12 or 19 at the time of the site.  Despite my young age, my mind was very lucid and clear.  No belief in UFO&apos;s or sightings prior to that or after the event took place.  Went out for a job on a track on a very clear night.  I heard a humming noise above me, looked above, and I saw a saucer. It was at a 60 degree angle from my position, i did not have to tilt back to look at it.  It was flat at the bottom, had a base, and capped at the top, sort of looked like a half circle.  Metallic in nature.  The lights were red and very bright, flashing on and off.  I could not determine if the base was spinning on it&apos;s axis or if i got confused by the flashing lights.  I had no time to get a camera but I&apos;m certain it was visible to other people.  It flew away into the horizon, gone from site.  It was definitely, metallic, saucer shaped, big, noisy and very visible.  A thundering jet flew over an hour later in the area. I report it now because I listened to Art Bell&apos;s show last night and listened to a similiar descriptive sighting.  I did an enormous amount of research on such a craft, told by experts no craft exists in operation.  I graduated from UofT in accounting and work as a financial analyst.", "noticed lights in the sky just above tree topsMY aunt and her 2 children and me were outside, and we noticed these lights they were square like around this disk shaped object. The lights went in a sequencial motion around this disk almost one would fade out and the other come on. My aunt told us to get in the car and we would follow it. We followed it for a while but the disk just all of a sudden dissapeared. The craft did not make any noise,and it moved in a zig zag movement but when it dissapeared it just took off. My aunt called the police and asked them if they had had any reports of any thing that night and they said it was probably a weather ballon. I know different.

THe sighting took place at about 10:15PM on Thursday, July 8th. About 30 minutes before the sighting, waiting in line in the car for the ferry, I noticed a helicopter moving in from the NE to the SE. I saw it and then it moved behind us and I could hear it for some time. A little bit later I was on the ferry in the car, which was parked at the very front of the ferry. I saw one helicopter who had 5 or so uncolored lights on. I also saw another object, that I could not discern as a helicopter or plane. It was too far away for me to tell its shape, but I could tell it was pointed. I thought it might be a small airplane. The unidentified object was directly in front of the ferry, and the helicopter was a ways to the left, moving to circle the area. The helicopter and unidentified object appeared to be at about the same height, and around the same speed, though the helicopter was farther away (I am terrible at estimating distances and altitude and speed.) The helicopter&apos;s lights, after a few seconds, changed to one uncolored light and one red/blue light (it appeared to be two lights cloase to each other, but I am nto sure) that alternated in blinking between uncolored and red/blue. This was the lighting all helicopters I saw from that point on were using. The unidentified object remained the same in terms of lighting. I looked at the object closely, as it passed directly over the ferry. I saw that the lights were all uncolored, shaped in an equilateral triangle, with one light in the center appearing to pulsate. I saw this from directly under the object as it passed over the ferry. Then the object mobed behind us and the ferry itself obstructed my ability to see it. The helicopter also moved out of sight as it moved to the left of the ferry where I was unable to see it. However, a few minutes later one helicopter came over the hill directly in front of me, and another came in! from the right where it had been invisible to me before due to the ferry obstructing my vision. I estimate that in all there were 3 or 4, possibly even 5 helicopters that appeared to be circling the area around Vashon Island. The craft I saw did not exhibit physically remarkable flight characteristics, except possibly for air-speed which I am not capable of effectively judging and so have no idea. The craft simply moved in a straight line and maintained the same speed and altitude. Like I said I guess it was traveling a little faster than the helicopters in the area, but it is hard for me to tell. Once I got off the ferry I saw another helicopter which was likely one of the ones I had seen earlier coming around in the circle. As surprising as it may sound I did not attempt to look back across the water at the object and choppers after I got off the ferry. I am not certain why.", "A diamond shaped object flew over baseball field.My friends and I were sitting in the middle of  a baseball field looking at the stars when we saw a big diamond shaped object start moving across the sky.

Lit by full moon, totally silent, vanished without traceOn a very clear and warm Friday evening, I was driving my best friend home from our college library. Upon parking in front of his house on the SW corner of Quedo Dr. and Kelvin Ave. in Woodland Hills, I got out of the car (facing east) and my eye was caught by something moving under the full moon which had just risen. I thought at first it was a large owl, but it quickly became apparent it was a brownish-metallic saucer hovering in a herky-jerky fashion over a residential area with no lights on and absolutely making no sound. Since this stealthy object was being well illuminated by the moonlight, we were able to observe this object with utter clarity and awe for about 5 minutes whereupon this thing stop; momentarily shudder; then vanish from sight. It was as if it sensed us watching it and left. I estimated this UFO to be appx. 300 Yds. away and 100 Yds. up, and about the size of a school bus. It had a small dome with a few portholes or windows which may have been slightly lit. It is of note that the air was highly static and the hair on our arms was sticking up. I also guessed that the craft was over the proximity of DeForest St. @ Natoma Ave.Although this occurred over 30 years ago, I hope it is of some relevance to report this now other than to get it off my chest. This was quite an eerie experience; in fact my friend got so scared, he panicked and ran to his house where he hid in a corner of his room under a blanket for a full day.

We were on our way to the pub. We had been walking North on MacKenzie Street and made for the steps between the Connaught Building and the United States Embassy. As I was walking down the steps, I noticed what looked like a hot air balloon in the sky straight ahead of us, i.e. looking East and down George Street. (Note: it is quite common to see hot air balloons over the Ottawa sky. It would be unusual to see them at that time of day however. They usually appear around 6:00 or 6:30 p.m.)  When I glanced back at it a few seconds later &ndash; now having crossed Sussex Drive and walking on the North sidewalk of George St., I noticed the object&rsquo;s strange behaviour: changing shape, which a hot air balloon does not do.

On the evening of August 21, 2004, I was setting up an 8&quot; schmidt-cassegrain &quot;go to&quot; scope on my deck when I noticed a strikingly bright red circular light (it was slightly smaller than the size of Mars when that object was at its largest in the sky in late August 2003)just a few degrees west of Polaris.  It did not twinkle; it had a constant (to my eyes) brightness.  The light&apos;s magnitude was similar to that of Jupiter&apos;s when that object is viewed on an exceptional viewing night.  The light really caught my eye, as nothing as large and luminous as it was should have been in that portion of the sky.  The viewing conditions were excellent (e.g., no clouds whatsoever, stable atmoshpere, and even with my eyesight (and this is saying a lot) I could easily discern (without telescopic aid) the split between Mizar and Alcor in the Big Dipper&apos;s handle.  I rushed my set up of the telescope, hoping to at least see the light in the telescope&apos;s finder scope, but the red light rapidly (in just 1-2 seconds) turned white and just as quickly disappeared, before I could get my telescope on it.  I was intrigued, but figured that my eyes had just played a trick on me (you know how people confuse stars and planets for ufos!!).  As the red light I have described was no longer visible, I began my evening&apos;s observing, bouncing around between different stars and messier objects, etc.  Oddly enough, after about 30 minutes or so it occurred to me that I had not seen the lights of a single aircraft since I started the evening&apos;s viewing (that was very unusual, as I live in an area where flights out of Midway Airport are frequently overhead, and small aircraft are quite frequent, as well).  That puzzled me, but I just went back to my viewing.  Around 2330 or so, I took a break from the telescope and noticed what appeared to be the lights of an aircraft approaching from roughly northeast and heading roughly southwest - but the familiar green and red, starboard and port lights I expected to see weren&apos;t there.  Instead, there were two very well definded circular red lights that ran an equidistant, and parallel course (as near as I could tell, slightly farther apart in distance than an average airliner&apos;s running lights).  I cannot tell you what altitude those lights were at, and although they passed through a good amount of sky, they passed out of view quickly.  I heard no sounds one would ordinarily associate with aircraft of any kind when I saw any of the lights I have described in this report.  I am only sending you this report because: (i) a non-lawyer coworker who lives in Tinley Park and knows of my astronomy hobby asked me Monday morning if I had observed anything unusual in the sky Saturday evening.  When I told him I had (and without telling him about the lights I had seen), he related to me that he and his wife had seen an odd red light in hee sky Saturday night, that he had told other coworkers of he and his wife&apos;s experience, that the other coworkers thought he was nuts, and that he wanted me to verify for them that there had been an unusual odd red light in the sky Saturday night (I did); and (ii) I read the reports of equal viewing date on this site that came in from Tinley Park, Illinois, which is the town adjacent to where I live.  I would like to note that when I broke down my telescope and brought it back inside my home on Saturday evening, I did not tell my wife of nearly 30 years of the red lights I had seen, but that I did tell her about the absence of air traffic, and that I then went back outside and watched the sky for about another 30 minutes - and saw no aircraft.  Highly unusal.  I have no idea what the red lights were, or why air traffic seemed to be nonexistent (at least from my vantage point) that evening, but must say that that evening provided me with the most unusual viewing experience I have ever had.  (You may contact me at my work telephone number (see Part 2, witness contact information, submitted with this report, if you wish). Thank you.", "Star disappeared while observing Perseid Meteor Shower.While observing the Perseid Meteor Shower from my back deck, I focused on one particular patch of sky, which was facing west with a declination of about 80 degrees.  I was looking at a cluster of stars, when one simply disappeared.  It was a clear night, with no clouds, and there were no airplanes in the area at the time, and no flocks of birds.  I watched the area for three or four minutes, but the star never reappeared.  I have no explantion for what I observed.", "This event happened many years ago; however, I felt compelled to write about it as to this day, I still think about it.  At the time, I was a teenager.  I was working and got off shift from my parttime job and was going home.  As I was walking up the crescent to my parents&apos; home I heard sounds/noises that were not of this world!  I looked to my left (there was a field there at the time), and saw really strange lights.  I cannot explain it, but they were the type of lights that I have never experienced before.  They were so bright and I am amazed that no one saw them (not that I am aware of).  But what frightened me the most was the strange sound.  I wish I could explain the sound, but after twenty-six years, I am still shaken by it.  I ran home as fast as I could, rang the doorbell so that my mom or dad could open the door.  I was way too shaken to use my house key.  Anyway, my father answered and he could tell by my face that I was scared to death.  I told my parents and my dad ran up to our 3rd floor and looked out the window.  All he could see was those lights. Like I said before, to this day I am still shaken by the events that occurred in July of 1978. Has anyone else experienced something like this?  Is anyone out there still shaken by an event that happened over 25 years ago?((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "A near miss?At 16:45 hours, I was sitting by the pool at the Autumn Park Apartments in Charlotte, NC, watching a De Havilland Dash 8 banking on a final approach to the Charlotte Douglas Airport, I observed a chevron shaped craft that looked at my vantage point to almost collide with the Dash 8. It seemed to come out of nowhere. It flew into my field of vision so quickly that it took me a second to focus on it. At first I thought the black chevron was a turkey vulture, but soon realized that it was flying too fast and dead straight, SW to NE. We were facing NE.  My wife has a compass on her key chain. The object was flying with a purpose. It made no noise. It took my wife awhile to see the object and by that time it was a black dot in the sky, heading in to the horizon. She thought it had to be a military or business jet because of the speed and the manner it was flying, but what I saw was too small and not shaped like any aircraft I know of and I can identify any type plane flying. The Dash 8 was about an inch long in the sky with my hand outstretched and my fingers apart. The object was about 1/8 to a &frac14; inch. It never deviated from its flight path and it seemed to me that it passed very close to the Dash 8. The sky was partly cloudy with two different cloud decks. The object and the airliner were both below the lowest cloud deck. I do not know the altitude the planes fly at that point from the airport. The distance is 12.5 miles due SW. The turbo props fly at a lower altitude than the jets.", "I was asleep, in a deep sleep, or so I thought, when I heard a loud noise approaching. I dismissed it somewht because there had been thunderstorms overnight.  As the noise grew nearer, I tried to get up and couldn&apos;t at first. I was conscious, but couldn&apos;t get up. Finally, I went to the window and looked outside but couln&apos;t see anything--clouds overhead. But, I still could hear a lound, oscillating, roaring noise hovering very near. By now my husband was awake and he heard it too.  We live near an airforce base and a public airport so I hear planes traversing regularly. Could this be a plane? If so, when did they start to hover?", "Bright Light in night skyI saw a bright white light shoot across the sky faster than anything ive ever seen before, stop dead than just as fast shot off in a completly differnt direction", "Multi-colored flashing lights hovering over small-town in WisconsinI went to let my dog out when I saw what looked like a blinking star in the western sky. On closer inspection I saw it was changing colors. I ran inside and grabbed binoculars, what I saw was slightly diamond shaped I think (it was blurred a bit) with flashing lights in blue, red, green, yellow, and white. It seemed to be moving back and forth very slowly.I woke up my parents and told them to get outside and look. I said I wanted a witness so they couldn&apos;t call me crazy. They both looked and saw what I had seen. I then saw what appeared to be an airplane with the usual red light flashing fly towards the lights. I lost sight of it when I noticed another set of blinking changing lights towards the north. This one was moving towards the west in the direction of the other object. We came inside and 5 minutes later I went back outside and they were gone. I know there is a chance I saw &quot;weather balloons&quot; but what I can&apos;t account for is how uncomfortable I felt as I watched them.

This was only discernable over a 15 minute time span as I believe they had to be very far away.  Until then It was hard to see any noticeable movement.  Upon Arriving home I noticed my neighbor staring up at the same objects and discussed it with him.  No noises were heard.  The air and water show I believe was this same weekend in Chicago.

At first I thought it was the lights from an airplane however it was moving far to slowly. It is moving much faster than the stars towards the north almost directly. I watched the object for over an hour. During that time I saw several meteors that streaked across the sky in almost the exact same path that the object is taking. I also saw a satellite heading straight towards it until it could not be see anymore with the naked eye. Most likley it&apos;s reflect was over-powered by the light from the object. This object is at an extremely far away. My best guess is that it is one of closer planets and is just reflecting far more light than usual. This would explain the slow speed, and why it was still going much quicker than the rest of the stars? Thanks((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The tree is proably 30 feet high and the craft hovered about 20 feet above that.  It sent down 4 beams of light to the street and just stayed there.  My girlfriend and I noticed darker squares or rectangles towards the middle of the circle.  After hovering with NO NOISE for about 20 seconds it lifted slowly then bolted out of sight.  It flew up first then down then out of sight. After this I was a bit excited and looked towards the skies.  Out of nowhere a triangular shape came into focus.  It was a pulsing red color and then as it got closer and in front of us it turned BRIGHT WHITE.  We saw about 15 of these, that came from the same direction, SE.  About 5 of the craft seem to flow back and forth, and change altitudes the other 10 just flew straight.  All started red, then proceeded to change to white.  I tried to put it all of this off as maybe a helicopter for the hovering object and maybe just some military aircraft for the other 15 but it just didn&apos;t seem right.  All were color changing (red to white for the triangles, and white with small dark squares or rectangles for the hovering craft) and seem to just handle much better than military aircraft. We called the local police and guess what the craft stopped coming, so the police thought we were crazy.

Never have I heard anyone talk about what I know about aliens. I was watching your show on SCI FI channel and I&rsquo;ve seen other UFO shows but this one peaked my interest.  Currently I&rsquo;m writing a book about my dealings with a government agency and aliens. I will be using a pseudo name and an attorney in order to process this book because I&rsquo;m afraid for my life if I use my true identity. In brief, I was only 8 days old when I died from Spinal Meningitis and revived over a minute later. After that I had a few unusual effects about me. My Father was in the military at the time and we were a bit poor. Suddenly we had some money which I believe came from the government. Due to our doctor reporting the incidents that were reported by My Mother, suddenly some people were interested in my abilities. Later in life I wanted to join the military but after trying to enlist I was suddenly pulled into a situation which placed me in an unknown place, an unknown room and unknown building that had the facilities to live. This room that I stayed in was normal except for the mirrored glass that was approx. 15 feet wide. I felt as if something was watching me. To make this story even shorter, I felt something trying to communicate with me behind that glass. I truly believe that my subconscious mind or 7th sense let me see what was behind that mirror. In my dreams I saw that it was not human. What I had figured out was that I was placed there for an experiment. It was watching me as I ate and probably copying me. Learning from me my habits. It&rsquo;s a shot in the dark but being there for 2 months told me that that&rsquo;s what was going on. The agency was definitely tied with the U.S. Air Force. There were mirrors in every room that I went to even the shower room. My abilities are telekinesis, telepathy and foresight.I never practice anything. I am a strong believer of God and never believed in aliens until that time.I don&rsquo;t believe that there is time travel. I do believe that our Air Force has experiments that they are playing with and people see those UFO&rsquo;s yet I know in my heart for sure that there are aliens alive and not held captive yet instead they must be here learning about us. My dreams most of all tell me things.I was not imagining anything. When I finish this book it will need to be edited. Someone that I contacted in another state who is a professional writer is very afraid to take on my book. She read the detail and said that her life would probably be in danger if she helped me at all. I have resigned from the Department of Justice in March of 2004 here in California. I felt that someone was looking over my shoulder. I don&rsquo;t know what interest you may have in this but if you don&rsquo;t contact me at least you will eventually see my book on the shelves one day. 5 friends know about some of the things and promised to carry out my book providing that I pass on before I find a way to print it all.

At the distance, I can tell if it was a helicopter or plane, something identifiable. Then all of a sudden, three balls of white light drop out of it like flares coming out of a plane.. Now I have seen flares dropped out of a plane before.  These were bright white balls of light that were mechanically controlled.  They were not fireworks from either Navy Pier, Soldier Field, or Sox 35th Stadium.  These lights left no trail of smoke and a lot larger than a firework spark or white flare. The first one dropped and I thought it would just keep falling and then it did these outrageous 90 degree turns. Then the same thing for the other two.

I stepped outside the two-story building in which I work to take a break and checkthe weather. I was standing in the shadow cast by the two-story building just soouth of the one I work in. (A narrow parking lot separates the builidngs). When I looked up into an area of the sky a little west and maybe north of where the sun was, behind the building, I saw a definite cylinder or elongated white light. It was in or surrounded by some brown hazy clouds with no defiinition.  This bright white cyllinder appeared to be a plane, except that it was not moving along as it should, if it were a plane. It repeatedly disappeared and reappeared as if it might have been in this small patch of brownish haze.  Outside this hazy area were small clouds with some brilliant highlights as they reflected the nearby sun. Not sure if during the observation period the light might have drifted sligthly southward, toward the edge of the roof which blocked my view of the sun. but it seemed to be in basically one place, which caught my attention because the smaller clearly defined clouds, unlike the slight haze, were moving northward while the light seemed to be in the same spot or slightly drifting the other way from the spot where I tried to place my initial observation. After maybe a minute the cylindrical light finally disappeared and did not reappear and a small cloud just to the west brightened intensely from the sunlight and this bright cloud started to burn my eyes so I looked away. Possibly the cylinder was a balloon, if they can resemble the oblong &quot;tailhook&quot; type of years ago. It&apos;s bright illuminationn was similar to the nearby small clouds.  The bright light definitely contrasted with the kind of haze in the area where it was located.  Its reappearing and disappearance would be consistent with passing through the haze, if the haze had varying thickness. But the object appeared to be a solid because it held its definite, narrow, small cylindrical shape each time it reappeared, unlike the clouds which were larger, more round and constantly shifting shape with wisps as clouds do. i did not contact the local FAA, as suggested when I posted s multi-person sighting over Denver a year or two ago because the FAA person I spoke too was a little rude and obviously did not want ot be bothered with questions about wind speed, cloud elevations at the time of interest. I merely post this in case someone else happened to see this unusual bright, slender object that was above and slightly south of overhead (5 or 10 degrees) and a little west of the sun at 3:30 p.m. when viewed from Downtown Denver, about four blocks west of Broadway. I add the sky not covered by clouds or this patch of haze surrounding the cylinder was a deep and vivid  blue on this particular afternoon.

Last fall I was with a friend of mine who works at Goddard Space Center. He and his supervisor were giving a seminar on LIDAR, and how it is used to record meteorological data. They brought with them a trailer that houses the LIDAR, among other equipment. The next evening my friend invited me to see the trailer. He hooked up an infrared camera located at the rear of the trailer. We were able to observe the density of clouds with the camera that was connected to a black and white monitor inside. The sky was generally clear with a few high cirrus clouds. As my friend was working, I was watching the monitor. I began to see small points of light zip through the field of view. I told him to take a look, but he said I was just seeing things. Only after he happened to see one of these points of light did he believe me. We watched for more points for several minutes on the monitor, and more came into view. Whatever we were seeing was going in a perfectly straight line from upper left to lower right. After we saw several more of these, we came to a concensus that what we were seeing were nothing more than satellites in orbit. A few moments had passed and we both looked at the monitor, and observed another point of light. However, this one came about halfway into the field of view, paused, and went back into the direction from which it came. My friend and I both looked at each other, kind of nervously laughed, and said to each other, &quot;I did NOT just see that!&quot;  My friend put a tape into the VCR which was connected to the monitor, but unfortunately, it was a time-lapse tape. We watched for another hour or so, and more points of light came into view, but no other point made a retrograde motion like the one mentioned. Satellites do not retrograde, and while I thought that this might be a bird, I remember that ALL of these objects came from the exact same direction. I would consent to a return e-mail or phone call.

It was very high up in the sky. It&apos;s path was something like a graph ... couldn&apos;t be possible for any aircraft. Then I thought it could be a bird. But I closely observed it and found no wings or shape. That&apos;s when I started thinking ... Wow ... is that an UFO? I think it is. It was at 40 degrees elevation on the east side. It was moving North for a while and then it changed direction towards East. Since there are a lot of long trees in my neighborhood, I couldn&apos;t see it after a minute when it went further east.

Both moved in straight lines directly over head. At this point, we noticed another &apos;satellite&apos; following in the same flight path as the first two.

The speed of the object didn&apos;t seem to change at all during the sighting as the turns were all fairly smooth.  By the time it went out of sight, it had veered off 45 degrees from it&apos;s original flight path.

I have done this in the past with good results. All one needs is a TV set disconnected from its cable input. A simple three or four element TV beam, hand held, is connected to the TV set.Now, it is simple to show that light travels at very close to one foot per nanosecond. The horizontal scan rate of the TV is 15750 per second. This corresponds to 65 microseconds or 65000 nanoseconds. So 65000/5280 = 12.3 miles across the screen.

Brisbane is on the other side of the country from out starting point. We had stopped for the night on the Western Australian side of the Nullabor Plain.

If it had kept moving across the sky I may have explained it away, but it didn&apos;t.Shortly after first seeing the object, it stopped. Not directly overhead of us, but at a slight angle. It sat there without moving for about two minutes. We heard no sound whatsoever. After about two minutes it moved back in what appeared to be exactly the same direction it had been coming from.

I can&apos;t possibly imagine that the light was caused by advertising lasers as there would be absolutely no way to determine where the advertiser was located on the ground (hence not a very effective means of advertising).....also, there was no light trail leading to a spot on the ground like a traditional advertising spot light would have (either the single oscillating beam kind or the newer 4 -beam type that makes the &quot;figure-8&apos;s&quot; in the sky).  Also, when I saw the light, it was in the early AM when all retail would be closed.  While brighter than a star, it really wouldn&apos;t have been all that noticable unless you looked up into that exact area of the sky and you realized it wasn&apos;t the &quot;normal&quot; red color of an airplane wing light and that it was stationary (in other words, it didn&apos;t appear to be anything designed to attract the attention of peo ple on the ground).  Lastly, the area I saw it over contains warehouses, some residential subdivisions and vacant fields but no retail or late night places such as bars or all-night restraunts. Here&apos;s a thought - The Tweeter Center (the Chicago area&apos;s main outdoor music amphitheater) isn&apos;t far away from the area in Tinley Park where I saw the light....could they possibly have a laser projection system that was pointed upward instead of towards the stage???  I&apos;ve been to Tweeter in the past however and I think all of their lighting and projection stuff is under a pavilion roof so it wouldn&apos;t have exposure to the sky...also I don&apos;t recall any clouds the evening I saw the light that a laser would bounce off of....it just seemed to be hovering mid-air in a clear sky (but no indication of anything solid attached to, or behind the light).  Also, I think 4/24 was too early in the season for Tweeter to be having concerts and even if they were, the event  would have been long over at the time I passed the area.

It was only one flash, it happend so quick I looked straight up and there was nothing their.

Around 11:15 to 11:40 ( we were away from watches and cell phones so time is approxamate) we witnessed a small dot cross clock-wise accross the sky above us.  It was not traveling as fast as the satillites we had seen that night and both my father and I were commenting on this fact when the &quot;dot&quot; seemed to turn on a very bright light.  The light came down towards us at an angle.  It became the brightest object in the sky.  It slowly faded back to the &quot;dot&quot; and continued away from us in an erratic pattern.  Both my father and I were totally transfixed on this object and are very certain of what we&apos;ve seen. When I dropped my Dad off at his house , he immediatly turned on his scanner.  He just caught the last end of a conversation about someone awaiting a call back from NORAD.  We have seen nothing in our paper about the object, but a lot of people were out watching the meteor shower so I find it hard to believe that no one else saw what Dad and I saw.", "I saw a boomerang shaped craft fly slowly over my house, it had no lights and made no noise, it was black and outlined in gray.On August 11th, 2004 at around 10:30 pm I saw a boomerang shaped aircraft fly over my house very slowly heading southeast. At first I thought maybe it was some sort of military aircraft but it made no noise and did not have any lights on it. It appeared to be flying about anywhere from 50-150 mph and was probably about 1,000-2,000 feet up in the air. The aircraft was black and outlined in a thin haze of gray. It was a fairly large aircraft, larger than a 747. I have never seen anything like it and do not know of any aircraft, particularly something that large that doesn&apos;t any noise.

The weather was warm with a cloudless sky, without appreciable haze.  The location was a couple of miles north of Tecate on State-94. So, I was driving eastbound on 94 and just passed the Tecate cutoff when I noticed what at first appeared to be a low-flying jet transport aircraft.It was rather low for the area, maybe about 6,000 feet above MSL.  However, it was very long in relation to its width.  If you could visualize a tall telephone pole you have an idea of its proportions.  It was moving west, straight and level, with the long axis of the body parallel to the direction of flight (it was flat).I thought that maybe it was an old stretch DC-8, but it was skinnier than that.  I then thought I was seeing a reflection off the curved side of a regular transport, but I then stopped my truck to look closer and I didn&apos;t see any evidence of reflection.  Further, I didn&apos;t see any rudder or wings.  It was too far away to see any markings/windows/portholes, but I certainly should have seen a rudder.  I watched as it proceeded to the west and was apparently several miles away when it looked like it turned slightly to the south.  Once again, I didn&apos;t see any wings, which if it had them I would have seen as it banked.  I would guess that it was at least 200-feet long with a rather bland gray color.", "circle object glided across sky with no soundI was looking into the sky around 1 a.m. looking for satelites (my hobby) I observed a circle object glide across the sky above me moving west to east.

However, it had a blue light on the bottom and 2 (or more) red lights around the side making it appear to be a disk. 4 witnesses. The strangest thing about this was that it made absolutely no noise. It was approximatley 150 feet from the tops of houses and added to the fear because I thought it was going to crash onto one of the roofs. We stopped the car and it hovered over the houses for about  10 seconds and then jetted off unbelievably fast....so fast that it was out of sight in seconds.

On August 20, 2004 from 10:25 to 10:27 pm we witnessed a triangular shaped object moving across the sky from a north to south direction.  The event only lasted maybe 3 minutes.  It was right over our heads. Not very high at all.  The length of the object may have been large enough to allow three large commercial airplanes in it. At first glance it looked as though it was three lights traveling simultaneously across the sky.  However, I looked at this object through Tasco mini binoculars.  I then was surprised to see this was one large object with three lights located on each corner. I need to add that I saw this object tilt toward the west and then level off.  Now I have grown up in Elk Grove Village with a commercial flight path over the top of my parents&rsquo; home since I was two years old.  I have seen probably every type of plane and size.  This was something that I have never seen before.  My wife agrees that this was the strangest object we have ever seen.  What is most interesting is this object only stayed in sight for maybe three minutes.  It completely vanished right in front of us.  I don&apos;t know if it went up or we just lost it in the cloud haze.  The night was partial cloudy and then clear allowing visibility to the night stars for a while. Then a haze would roll through for short time and obstruct a clear view of the night sky. This is why I say we don&apos;t know if we just lost it in the cloudy haze rolling through.  My wife says the object did not fade into a cloudy haze.  I was busy trying to setup a telescope to look at this object closer.  I never got the chance.  We have no idea what this was, if someone does let us know.  That is all the information I have to give.

I felt like something had me in it&apos;s grip but yet I felt whole. I think it scaned me! I never could remember how I felt until I was older. What broke my affixation on the object was our Mom. I don&apos;t know how long it had been, but Her yelling at us to shut up was what made the thing go away.

The place of business is an LPG Refinery and where bring the plant online at the time.  I had an opportunity to observe the object throught the binoculars for about 15 minutes.  The object was that of a diamond shape on end and was made up of several dome shaped serfaces.  It was metalic and what was wierd about the object was that it gave off a multi-color glow of orange, gold, yellow blue and magenta. Like a prisim.  It acted as if it were floating and changing orientation to me the observer.  After about 10 minutes into the viewing it changed shape into a hourse shoe shape but maintianed its multi color.  Something else that was observed was that the color was not as detecable from the ground.  First thought was that it could be some mylar ballons perhaps but if they were they maintianed tight formation, maybe tied together.  Object was however approximatley 15,000 ft. so if it were some kind of ballons they were very large.  Co-workers acted strangely as though it were no big deal.

They were traveling approximately 40 mph and were traveling southeast.  They appeared to be playing a game like ring around the roseo.  They would come together in the center, touch, and then go back out again.  They continued to travel separately, in a circle and then come together and touch, and then go back out.  They did this approximately 10, maybe a dozen times.  I followed them for as long as I could, about a mile or so until the end of the road.  It is pretty deserted out there, only a few houses.

I observed directly ahead of me (west) a light that I first thought was a low-flying helicopter, due to the intensity of the light, and the fact it appeared to be not moving. I&apos;m not sure the exact distance between myself and the object, but I would have to say somewhere between 8-12 miles. At first, I thought it could have been a helicopter between 750-1000ft above ground level. The light seemed far away (see above estimate) yet it was oddly bright. I would describe the color as a yellowish white. Almost like the color of a 60 white light-buld. I was watching this object for about 5 seconds when it appeared to split in two. Each of the lights were less bright than the sum when they were connected. In altitude, they were parallel. One of the objects (the one to my right) started flying north towards South Mountain, and the one seemed to remain in place for another 3-4 seconds. Then another light appeared next to the remaining craft. This time the light was definately less bright than the &apos;main&apos; object (the remaining one of the pair). It was much closer to this object than distance between the initial two. It was about 100 ft lower in altitude, and 150ft-200ft to the left (south) of the &apos;main&apos; object. I continued driving along Pecos and then turned right (north) on 32nd street and the trees to my left temporarily blocked my view for maybe 10-15 seconds.

I went into my house to put my dinner that I just bought at Taco Bell on the counter in my kitchen and went back outside to continue following the object. I did not see the object I had been tracking, At least not where it was before. I saw something moving north very quickly and passing right over South Mountain, but I&apos;m not sure which of any of these objects that could have been. It very well could have been a different object altogether, maybe a plane. I only got to see it for a second or two and then it disappeared over the mountain, and there was nothing else to observe, so I went back inside. One other thing I should mention is the air was very humid and there was an intense electrical storm at the time. Lightning, but with barely any rain. There was another car about a hundred feet ahead of me driving on Pecos, so he/she/they might have seen this as well.

In any case, I purchased a pair of binoculars with a magnification of 16x and got a better view of this object.  The red and blue flashes are not due to atmospheric interference but actually emanate from the perimiter of the object, the center of which appears to be bright white.  Also, I had to focus the binoculars to less than infinity in order to see the object most clearly, suggesting that the object is not a star although it certainly appears to be one each night.

The craft was shaped like a Stingray with 3 white lights on the top of it. I first noticed the craft because it was not flying like a normal aircraft because of the sharp take off angle (I did not notice it taking off from the ground)and then the sharp turns, diving toward the ground and the hover. My wife first saw the light of the craft and the saw it making a 90 degree turn and then dive toward the ground and since she was not driving noticed the stingray shape. She noticed the 3 white lights that if we used the stingray shape was two of the lights at the outside as the flippers and one light at the front where the nose would be. My wife heard noises similar to a jet engine making different noises like a acceleration and deceleration noises, I did not hear them. The craft looked to be about the size of a normal passenger car. The area that we had the sighting was not populated as most of highway 5 is between Bakersfield and Stockton. The craft would have been sighted by cars in the north bound lanes, with a better view of the hover.

My buddy, Bill and I, and our dates, Just drove in to the parking lot behind the Friendly Ice Cream in Thompsonville,CT, when my date spotted a small golden-orange glowing ball in the distant southern sky toward Hartford. In a few seconds, the object was overhead and the shape was that of a bowl, flat on top. It looked about 2 feet in diameter, but made no sound. It hovered motionless for about 30 seconds, then in a streak lasting about 3-4 seconds, was gone in the direction from which it came.We drove the car to the parking lot in front of Friendly&apos;s and got out and ran into  Friendly&apos;s telling all what we saw, and everybody inside looked at us as if we were dilusional. Needless to say, we were embarrassed. The next day in school, several classmates from other parts of town confirmed what we saw.The observers were 2 basketball players and our cheerleader dates, ages about 17.I served in the USMC from Jan 53 to Jan 56 as a radar operator.It was sometime in 1954 or 55 in K-3 Korea, Po Hang Dong,while on radar watch, I observed 3 blips on my radar scope which crossed Korea from east to west in about 20 seconds.

I went up the road for a better look but when i got there they were gone, but im not entirely convinced that they were ufos.

I had gone an alternate route home than I usually do because I stopped at a gas station in my area with the lowest price for fuel as my vehicle was low.  Haveing gone this alternate route allowed me to travel on a street that gave me a clear view (Than I otherwise would have had on my normal route home.)of what we in Phx call a green belt which are various strips of land with huge power lines running through town. As I rounded my turn,1 street away from my home, I noticed a  dark/black triangular object seemingly hovering (Extremely low in an area with limited light.)facing west, directly over the power lines.  I was in astonishment and rapidly drove toward the object.  As I approched I rolled my window down as to try and hear engine noise and there was none.  As I came to a stop in the street I observed the object. Moments later Three bright white forward lights turned on along with a red strobe in the center and white strobes on 2 tip sides blinking.  The object Then began to rotate and turn sideways turning north moving off rapidly.  I pursued it as best as I could and observed it turning westward two streets further up.  The object seemed to be mimicking the flight paths of commercial traffic approching westwardly at that time both north and south of the object&apos;s position. The object however did not seem to be increasing altitude. It instead followed the same height and flight path (Which would be just south of the Phx airport.)as far as I could track it from my perspective. I then proceeded to observe commercial traffic from the north of Hwy 202 and south of Hwy 60 approching like fireflies in line on thir normal flight paths for a westward approch into the Phx airport.  All the other air traffic altitudes seemed much higher. Later I returned home and related my expirence to friends and family.  I then remembered I still had a phone number for an individual I spoke with over three years ago,who is a member of MUFON and gave me a card. I called him and gave my account of my sighting.  I,however, am not a member of any related group.  I felt that mabey my information could be useful in the event that someone else might have witnessed the same thing.

The object went West across the horizonin in about 10 seconds and then stopped. After stopping, it then dropped out a dark bundle like object. Soon after that,it then turned and came towards us(South)rather quickly.  THere was no sound at all.  Then after only going about 1 mile down the road, the object it seemed was almost instantly in right front of us. The object then began to hover slowly overtop of us. WE were still driving down the road so we ended up going right under it.  THe object was triangular with one light on each point of the triangle.  There was also a red light located next to one of the lights. After the object went over top of us, I looked out of my sunroof behind me and the lights began to change into different patterns.

The day was perfectly clear and I was looking at a contrail in the sky attempting to determine if the contrail was currently being formed.  My sister joined me on the balcony and I pointed to the contrail and told her what I was trying to determine.  She looked away and started to sit down and I saw a large object appear out of one cloud. I looked at it for a second or two, realized that I could not distinguish any features that I would normally recognize in a plane.  I immediately said to her &quot;what&apos;s that&quot;.  Both of us watched it for approximately three to five seconds until it disappeared into another cloud. The diameter of the object was slightly larger than a full moon appears in the sky.  It was flying in a south-easterly direction and ascending slightly.  There was no sound.  The object was not shiny and had texture to it; it was not completely flat; and was a sort of gunmetal color, maybe bordering closer to gold than silver.  There was no sound and there were no lights. My sister said immediately, &quot;that was the classic cigar shape&quot;.  She was right. This object was flying well within the no-fly zone and away from the traditional flight paths that we observe from here which are well to the north.  The object was flying at an altitude common for helicopters. I got my camera immediately afterward and got a photograph of the two clouds, the one from which it first appeared and the one into which it disappeared. On May 21 of this year, my sister and I saw balls of light moving furiously in a counter clockwise circle from windows about 10 feet from the balcony where we were today.  Though those balls were much lower in the sky, the location of that incident and this one are almost identical. Witness Two: It was flying at about the speed I would expect of a commercial aircraft, although it was far, far off the usual commercial flight path.  The thought that kept going through my mind was &quot;that&apos;s not a plane, it&apos;s not a jet&quot;.  It was a classic cigar shape, no wings or markings  other than what appeared to be a dark band about one third of the length from the back end. It&apos;s difficult to judge size based on distance, but my impression is that it was extremely large, that it was double or more the size of a commercial airliner.It moved very smoothly and silently.  Color was a dull metallic gunmetal and there were no visible lights on the craft.   I agree with everything in my sister&apos;s report.((NUFORC Note:  This appears to us to be a high-quality report, and it is submitted by a witness who has submitted another credible report, in the past.  Based on her description, we do not see how the object could have been any type of conventional aircraft.  We would welcome reports from any other witnesses, who may have witnessed the same event.

There were between 3 to 5 kids all about 11 years of age. The year was approximately, 1966. We heard what we thought was the wind blowing through a stack of irrigation pipes. It was very loud and strange. We noticed that there was no wind blowing across the pond and the hillsides were only about 20&apos; higher than the water level. We ran to the top of the hill where the sound came from and there wasn&apos;t any irrigation pipe to create the sound. The wind was blowing straight down on us, moving the pasture grass as if by a leaf blower and the sound seemed to be coming from above us. We looked up and did not see anything even though the sky was clear. As we stood there the wind and the sound moved off to the east at an increasing rate of speed. We talked about this for awhile with the reasoning of an 11 year old and went back to fishing never bringing this event up again. I never forgot what happened that day and while talking one day about 3 years ago to one of the other persons that was there I brought it up. I said &quot;You know, we&apos;ve been friends for over 40 years and there is one thing we have never talked about, you know what that is?&quot; and he just looked straight ahead and said &quot; You mean the day we went fishing?&quot;.

We can see like portals on the top outside of the craft through the binoculars. With the naked eye they sway from side to side. A green light or red light blinking it changes. Just a few nights ago my wife and I were in Skyline park in the desert in Susanville and we were observing them. A police car pulled up and the officer walked up to us. She asked us what we were doing and we told her and pointed out a ufo. We handed her the binoculars and she looked at it. She looks back at us with a stunned look on her face and then pulled her maglite and flashed the craft. The craft flashed back at us and it moved, the officer then looked at us and said: &quot;Did you guys see that it moved&quot;! and then said again to us: &quot;You guys are freaking me out&quot;! and she took off! We noticed that there will be two of these objects by the moon and the rest in a circular position in the night sky around the Susanville area. Another thing I would like to add is that the objects will black out when we try to see them in our telescope, when we look away they turn their lights back on. They dont seem to mind us looking at them through the binoculars.

It jumped vertically probably the length of my index finger within one eye closed. It started to move right and then back left, like it was hovering. We all just looked at one another and said did you see that.  We could see two planes in the distance, one to the left of the object and one to the top right of the object. You could tell they were planes by the way the lights were flashing and there uniform movement. There were no clouds in the sky. As the plane to the left got closer to the object it just vanished.

I thought this was one of them so I wanted to get it on camera. It looked like it was preparing to land from what I could tell. I noticed a clearing of the tree tops just ahead in it&apos;s path. When the craft got to the clearing, I realized this was no military craft. I was triangular in shape, black, very smooth texture,very areo dynamic.

So, I was watching it move really quickly across, like most satellites do, when it started flashing red. [The reason we see satellites is they are far enough out in the earths orbit, that the sunlight hits them and reflects back to earth] When it started flashing red I followed it even more intensely, when it suddenly slowed down. I had now reasoned that it was not a satellite due to the blinking and slowing down. I figured thus it must be an airplane that&rsquo;s just at an extremely high altitude. But two things got in the way. A: Why didn&rsquo;t I see the red flashes of light earlier and B: How could it slow down to almost a complete halt. To top it off, the object took a 90-degree turn and sped up and the red flashing got brighter and more rapid.

There was blue sky between the two sets of clouds.  As I watched I saw an object drop out of the thunderhead and hover in the space between the two clouds for a few seconds.  The object dropped into the small cloud, disappearing.  Suddenly the object shot out of the lower cloud and hovered again between the two for a few seconds.  Then, just as quick, it shot back into the thunderhead.Now my curiosit was up and I waited to see if the object would appear again.After roughly a minute the object dropped out of the thunderhead again.  This time after hovering for roughly 15 seconds it moved quickly north and hovered again between the two clouds.  By this time the smaller cloud had moved north somewhat and the tunderhead seemed to have gained some height.  After about 10 seconds of hovering the object shot down into the smaller cloud.

In the rear of the formation (way back) was the flashing red side lights of the helicopter, 2 lights on either side.The southern most lit craft passed approx 100-200 ft above the hill top to my south and I observed that the lit portion was only in the front of the craft.There appeared to be some type of tail or upward wing extension in the rear as I was observing it in an almost parallel view. It appeared tear drop in shape, moving at a high rate of speed,and moving as if it was skimming across the surface of water (a jerking kind of forward movement).The center craft had the same kind of motion and appearance but the real observation I had was the northern most craft that kept coming directly towards me. The front of the craft with the glowing light was approximately 100 ft up and I could see that the light area was quite wide, at least 10ft across in the front. I could see the lit  portion as it passed directly over me, the dark metallic shape as it blocked all the stars above,the passage of the craft over the roof of my house.No noise,40ft across,no wind,turbulence,nothing.The helicopter pursued that one but it could never catch up.All three shot up to the western sky across the Casinos along the river, the northern one being chased by the helicopter  which was way in the rear. I observed that I could see the lit area in the front of the crafts as they were going away from me and up which means that the lit portion is on the top, sides and bottom. They are not spotlights as they do not project any beam but seem to glow quite brightly instead.All 3 craft plus the helicopter passed almost directly over the Bullhead City International Airport probably 500 ft high. No mention of any flyovers was ever made in the local papers the next day. I wonder if any Radar reports by the Airport were ever made and of course no military reports were ever released to the media.In short,nothing ever happened and for 2min of my life, I was privileged to see something the likes of which I will probably never see again. Maybe the craft that passed over my rooftop saw that I was a fellow star traveler of sorts (25 years of astronomy) and granted me the honor of just a peek.I was never in fear of the crafts but I do fear my government which is why it has taken so long to report this event.

The atmosphere harbored a considerable amount of light pollution, but an object appeared very noticeably.  An orange sphere appeared to be traveling from west to south-east, and traveled in a steady, fast pace, and was totally silent. This object was traveling faster than an aircraft, but far slower than a meteor.  I would estimate that the object was below the clouds, due to the distinct view and minimal dissipation of light to the surrounding atmosphere. The object was visible for approximately five seconds, and abruptly disappeared.  It was peculiar that the sphere disappeared instead of &ldquo;burning out&rdquo;.  Immediately after the object was visible, a helicopter traveled over our location in the exact trajectory that the orange sphere was bearing.  I can not determine if the helicopter was commercial or military, only that is was quite loud like the military variety.  At the same time, there were two aircraft traveling in different directions directly overhead.  These aircraft were at a high altitude. From 2210 until 2310 there were 18 distinct aircraft traveling in an eastern to western direction.  This seemed like an extremely high number of aircraft to be located in a particular vicinity, especially in the time period of 2210-2310.  These aircraft appeared to be non-commercial, due to the close proximity and flying pattern.  The formation was triangular and staggered. I had the impression that the aircraft were military. There was a great variety of beacon lights on these aircraft; some displayed an extremely large wingspan, giving the impression of a bomber style or &ldquo;AWACS&rdquo; (radar) style aircraft.  My co worker and I traveled to a location approximately three miles away, where there was less light pollution and elevated so that our view was not impaired. From 2330-0200, there were absolutely no aircraft visible.  The saturation of aircraft in the timeframe of the sighting of the orange sphere causes a profound suspicion in the witness, and is lead to draw no other conclusion that the a governmental entity was in pursuit of the same object  that I observed.

This individual also contacted Harrisburg International Airport, spoke with an individual in Operations, who then contacted his supervisor who was an FAA employee.

It was the middle of the night one something awoke me- a strange feeling-I didn&apos;t like it. I looked at the clock. 2:03 am. The clock was on a dresser next to the window. I saw a light outside, but assumed it was an aircraft. I made a double take. The light I saw was very large, larger than the moon.(In appearance) Its colours constantly shifted, changing hues every second. Surrounding it were dozens of smaller lights. Through the window I saw it had a strange, grotesque shape- the large light was the center of the craft, and along with the other lights were a few that were smaller than the big one, but bigger than the small ones, that lined the outline of the craft. The craft iself seemed tear-drop shaped, yet sprouting from random parts of the craft were long, tentacle-like protrusions, and they seemed to be comming dangerously close to the ground. The pointed end of the craft was a single, stiff spine. Having keen vision, even in the dark, I squinted to see if I could refer just what was on the ship. I saw mininscule humanoids in the craft, but before I could decifer more, a flash of light broke the calm, settle night, and it&apos;s the last thing I remember.

Most people do not want to talk of it. Most people deny anything happend.But they didn&apos;t want it to happen again.

Most of the animals he had down at the barn consisted of Beagles and if there had been anything strange going on the head dog would have made a racket about it. The next morning; all of the dogs were fine the females with their puppies were all fine.

It was a summer night and we where all outside on the patio relaxing. Then... this thing had to be big, really big as it looked like a red dot that went across the moon.  It was not a Comet or an Asteroid as it had no tail and honestly moved to slow to be either of the two in my opinion.As a note the light was solid, it did not blink and was the color of a traffic light. It was going the speed or looked the same way a plane looks crossing the sky.It appears slow but in fact is going 100&apos;s of miles an hour. Now the fact it crossed the moon in about 4 seconds is very fast indeed.I can not even begin to speculate on the speed. I made a small animation of what it looked like.

My husband says it got brighter and this is when he first started noticing it. I didn&apos;t start noticing it until it started moving. It had sat still for 10-15 minutes and I thought it was a star. Although there were no other stars in the sky at the time, I didn&apos;t think anything about it. It started slowly moving upward. We watched with passing interest although it was much brighter than planes or stars. My husband said he saw it blinking, I never did. It continued upward, then went very quickly to the west (right). We got up from our chairs and walked to the edge of our porch to get a closer look. It quickly started going upwards again and then VANISHED! We both were freaking out!

He was at a friends house (his college teacher) and they talked all night about studies, not realizing the late hour. He left just before sunrise as the sky was just becoming light. When they walked out the front door together they were startled and dumbfounded by a huge UFO hovering about 40 feet directly above the house. He could only tell me that the craft was big beyond description. It was so big and so close that it blocked out the immediate view of the sky. Like a giant blimp right on top of you. He could see every little detail of the under belly of the craft. Not a single sound could be heard. They looked at it for several seconds and he said it then just instantly disappeared before their eyes. He could not give explanation how this huge UFO disappeared but said it was the most unnerving experience ever he had.

I saw an object that was very high in the sky and moving very quickly.  All I saw was white light... not very bright, hazy in appearance. It seemed like the size of a airplane, but there was no noise and it&apos;s speed was incredible.  Because of the haze and distance away, it&apos;s impossible to say what shape the object was.  It moved south to north going the same speed the whole time.  I thought it may be a satellite, but am not so sure, I&apos;ve seen what I think are satellites and they&apos;ve alway had the appearance of a star moving across the sky relatively quickly.

All of a sudden I saw what I woulda swore was a huge plane landing in this filed out back of our house behind a set of woods. It was huge and had blue, red, green, and yellow flashing lights.  We watched it for a second, dumb founded wondering why the hell would such a large plane be landing back there unless it was in trouble. So we ran upstairs to my office to get a better view over the trees and saw the thing rise up real quick then just kinda hover then bam it shot off to the north and was gone. Then about 15 minutes after that this big bright white light just appeared further off in the distance and stayed there for a bit and then started moving to the left and right then it shot up a ways, sat there, and then bam it too was gone. During the time the large craft was in our sight our satellite television kept screwing up, the picture going all frazzled. When the bright white light appeared later our Satellite went out again.I&apos;m going up on our roof tonight with our video camera as I have spoken to two other people who have seen this that didn&apos;t know of my experience before telling me theirs. Hopefully I can catch something on tape.", "I saw a flashing colored orb in the eastern sky over the San Jacinto Mountains.What I have been witnessing began on July 19, 2004 at approximately 2:30 am.  I live in a canyon of Palm Springs, CA that is surrounded by the San Jacinto and the Santa Rosa Mountains.  Our home has many large windows that open up to view the mountains.  I awoke to use the restroom around 2:30 am and was taken aback by a large white &quot;light&quot; that was literally illuminating my bathroom.  The light was too big to be a star and was very close to the mountain top (it was in the eastern sky).  It had some dimision to it but I can&apos;t really say what shape it was, it was just the brightest light I had ever seen.  I woke my husband because I didn&apos;t want to be the only one to see it, he looked at it and agreed that he appeared to be too large and bright to be a star.  The following evening at around 9:30 pm I looked over the mountains to see if I could see this light and it wasn&apos;t there, however, there was an orb that was flashing blue, green and red lights, I observed it closer with a pair of binoculars and it appeared to be pulsating.  My husband saw it also.  We went to bed and I woke up around midnight and again at 2:30 am, the orb was still there flashing but the bright light was not there.  I went back to bed to awake again at 4:30 am and the bright light was there again, in the same spot, there were more colored flashing orbs around the sky but not as close as the one observed earlier in the evening.  I have been watching the sky every night since.  On Thursday, July 23, 2004 I was driving down Highway 111 in Palm Springs around 8:30 am, it was dusk and I saw this bright light in the western sky over the Santa Rosa Mountain range, it appeared to be moving slowly downward towards the mountain.  I got home and got my husband to come out and look, he saw it also, the light continued to drift downward until it disappeared behind the mountain range.  I looked around the sky and with my binoculars, I could see several flashing orbs, all with green, red and blue lights. Every evening since July 19th I have awoken at different times during the night to see if the light is in the eastern sky, it has never appeared before 12:30 am and is always still visable until the sun rises.  As I watch the light it slowly drifts upward.  Interestingly enough, the light in the western sky that drifts in and down appears to be the same light that settles over the mountain in the eastern sky to only drift back up until out of sight.My siting last evening is what has compelled me to report these sightings.  I awoke at 12:38 am and looked out towards the eastern sky over the San Jacinto Mountains and I saw a circular shaped orb that had red, green, and blue lights on it and it was hovering in a stationary position over the mountain.  It was the same orb that I have seen in the sky higher up only this time it was low almost sitting on the mountain.  I watched it for about 15 seconds and then it just disappeared, I stood there with my mouth to the floor breaking out into a cold sweat.  As I kept my eyes glued to the sky, the orb reappeared, flashing and hovering and then dipped below the mountain range. The bright light was not in the sky.  I awoke at 4:30 am again to find the bright white light hovering in the same position that I saw the circular orb.  I am pretty freaked out at this point and I am starting to think I&apos;m crazy.  Has anyone else in the Palm Springs area reported such a siteing?  I know that I will see the light again tonight, It seems to be getting closer to the mountains every evening.  The orbs continue to flash about the sky around this area.  Any clues as to what this could be???????

I asked her if she thought it was a blimp she said she&apos;d  never seen a blimp with lights around it. We stood watching this lit up disc shaped object move from East to West it as it changed color sometimes surrounded by a red hazy glow and three bright metalic red lights.  There was a circular shaft of light in the center of  it . It moved at random speeds, more slowly when it was traveling side to side where it went behind  trees and seemed to hide for a moment  then reapear. The speed picked up when it moved  towards and away from us. I could see the bottom of the disk when it traveled North (towards us) it had a circle of blue and green lights around it. When it moved away it changed shape completely it looked more oblong with a fish like tail. The first time it changed shape I was sure it was going to vanish it got considerably smaller and seemed to travel far away at a high speed then came back to its original shape and spot in a clearing between trees.. Two hellicopters appeared after we had been watching it for about 10 minutes one swooped down close to it  from above and vanished out of sight another hellicopter was shining a searchlight below and to the east of the object  it was about five or ten minutes before that one left as well.We had to meet someone for dinner and left after watching it for about 25 minutes. It was hard to take my eyes off but I was also having doubts and questions about what I was seeing and trying to turn it into something  explainable- maybe some new military plane.", "At least a hundred miles out to sea, a long time ago, in 1957, a very interesting sighting, after midnight.  First report.This is a very old sighting, and one of my reasons for reporting it now is that I have only recently begun to research UFO sightings.  The specific reason is the vortex I will mention in the following report.I was a signalman in the Canadian Navy, serving onboard HMCS Athabaskan, and our small convoy of seven ships had been on and excercise which carried us from Victoria, BC, Canada, to Honolulu, then San Diego, and home again.On the night of this event, our seven ships were steaming in &apos;line abreast&apos;, at one thousand yards, or half a mile (between ships), and we were all observing radio silence and &apos;darken ship&apos;, which means no lights were visible on any of the ships, and all radar and radio communication was off.  Our ship was the westernmost in the formation.Approximately a mile, or perhaps more, further to the west, the bridge lookout and I both spotted a very bright, bluish light coming from somewhere low in the sky.  With binoculars, we could make out a rather large, circular shape, with what seemed like portholes around the lower perimeter.  Inside of this circle, near what appeared to be the forward part of the object, was the bright, bluish light, that appeared to be at least as bright as our carbon arc signal/search light, which was rated at twenty million candlepower.  The light was shining directly down into the ocean.Soon, two officers-of-the-watch and the Commanding Officer were all looking at the object through binoculars.  At first, we all thought it might be a United States military helicopter on some sort of maneuvers, but we were well out to sea, and none of the &apos;Notices to Mariners&apos; (sent to all ships at sea), indicated any sort of military exercises, save ours, in that area.  Furthermore, no helicopter could be as large as this object appeared to be.  By now, about ten minutes had passed.Inside the beam of bluish light emanating from the bottom of the object, I personally noticed a vortex, or &apos;waterspout&apos;, (a waterspout is about the same as a tornado, with water inside of it rather than debris) swirling between the ocean surface and the object, and it was my thought that the object was taking on water.  I observed this phenomenon for approximately a minute, perhaps longer.The Commanding Officer ordered me to train the big carbon arc searchlight on the object, and to await his orders before switching it on.  I laid my binoculars aside and trained the light.  The three officers then took positions as far over the side of the bridge as possible, to avoid the glare which would reflect from the superstructure of the ship, rendering their binoculars useless.  I was then ordered to turn the light on, which I did, keeping a close eye on the object. Of course, I was partially blinded by the aforementined glare, and all I could observe was the bright bluish light.  It seemed that within a few seconds of opening the shutters of the searchlight, the object simply disappered.  At the very least, the lights which had been visible around the object went out, including the bright light aimed at the ocean.The Commanding officer then &apos;broke&apos; radio silence and ordered the operations room personnnel to turn on the Sperry radar, set it to a twenty five mile range, and make exactly two 360 degree sweeps, and turn it off again, which they did.  I would guess that two &apos;sweeps&apos; would have taken another minute.  Nothing showed up on the screen.  The officers then held a brief conference amongst themselves, and that seemed to be the end of the matter.The next day, on a whim, I looked in the ship&apos;s log, and found no mention of the sighting, and I joked with the lookout that we had seen a &apos;flying saucer&apos;.  In those days, 1957, the term UFO was just gaining popularity.Many years later I thought seriously about what I had seen, and then the issue of Crop Circles began to appear in the press.Here are a couple questions.  First.  Could it be that the object was taking on water to replenish a hydrogen supply?  Or even as potable water for themselves?  Second.  As all crop circles seem to have similar characteristics, that is, the grass, or crop, is all neatly laid out in one direction, stems bent but not broken, and in a perfect circle, could it be that whatever made the &apos;vortex&apos; or &apos;waterspout&apos; mentioned above could also make these neat, precise, geometric shapes?  I believe so.  If that is the case, why hasn&apos;t someone else come up with the idea?  I mentioned that I have only begun to think about UFOs seriously, so maybe I missed a report somewhere that provided a plausible explanation for how these patterns are made.", "Four Circular Objects in Formation Sighted Over the Pacific Ocean Off Redondo Beach, Calif.I live in a house on the beach in Redondo Beach, Calif. At approximately 4:45 a.m., PST, I woke and witnessed four circular objects hovering over the Pacific Ocean to the west of my location, most likely about 3-4 miles out to sea. I observed them for several minutes, expecting them to get closer if they were airplanes. I also looked for flashing lights, simliar to those on aircraft. I could see no movement, and no lights. The objects seemed to remain stationairy, and did not move closer to my location. They appeared in formation, one lighting up at a a time. When I first caught a glimpse of them, only three appeared. Then a fourth appeared to the far north. The objects switched places several times, then slowly, one by one, the lights began to fade out, starting with the light farthest north, ending with the light farthest south. Several times the light to the north faded, then reappeared. Given the speed of the movement in which the objects changed places, I suspect they are most likely aircraft of some kind, possibly helicopters. No noise could be heard, however, and the entire event lasted only 10 minutes or so.", "Bright light video taped,I just like the person in LI and the one in AZ witnessed a bright stationery light in the sky after being waken by what sounded like a big bang, firework or explosion.  But never any fire engines came.  I watched the light for a while and then began to video tape it.  It was egg shapped or appeared to be with a black band across the top.  It appeared to be a ridge.  The center was redish with a greenish edge.  I am sorry, but this is not venus.  I can see a clear ridge where the band is.  The video shows the red change a bit.  I hoped to spot it again but it has been cloudy.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at Venus.  PD))ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS:Dont even tell me It is a planet.

I have on video an object that you will try to tell me is a planet and most likely venus.  But you would have to then finish your statement with &quot;stupid&quot;.  Here is my story. I woke up hearing a loud explosion like noise.  I thought it to be a transfomer or a gas like explosion.  I then went to my window to look for signs of fire and listen for the sounds of sirens.  There were none. While looking in the sky I noticed an airplane flying into the path of what I thought was another airplane but the light looked like it was flying toward me head on.  I then realized it did not move and the other plane flew by it and appeared to be miles away.  I then got my video camera out and began taping.  I thought I got a planet until I hooked it to my tV. NO planet.  MY camera zooms 350x.  Not a telescope.  Yet the object was clear, round with a ridge spitting out red lights, spinning several times within 2 minutes.  Planets don&apos;t spin.  I am not even a true believer but no one is going to tell me that this is venus.  Not true.  I could never have zoomed in to a planet with my camera.  Planets have not indents, lights and cant spin several times in 2 minutes with an obvious clarity.  Long Island guy in NY video taped this and I would like to chat with him.  A person in England has the same object on video tape.  I only wish I taped it longer.The sound I heard was probably a sonic boom since there was never a need for emergency help.", "Black triangular craft was hovering over my town area for over half an hour, it looked to be inspecting or looking for something.I was up late on the internet playing games.

After 30 minutes, i grew curous that it had not stopped, and went outside in the garden to look for this mystery &apos;helecopter&apos; type sound. I stepped through the garden on to the street and looked.. what i saw i will not forget. There was a dark triangle drifting around the sky at fairly fast speeds and acceleraton, seemingly scanning the area i live in.  It was triangular with lights on the tips and was spinning slowly, and was turning at speeds that were impossible. It seemed that i had only just got to the end of my garden pat when the thing turned and converged over where i was. I ran inside and after about 15 minutes, the sound stopped.

It passed by extremely fast and disappeared behind what looked like it should have been a cloud, but there were none out that evening.  The sky was clear and full of stars.  The size was relative to a full moon.  The moon was not out that evening.  I did not hear any sound with seeing the object. About ten minutes later, I saw a shooting star and in comparison, this did not even come close.  This traveled horizontally and extremely smooth and fast, whereas the shooting star dipped and fell. I have never seen anything in the sky like this before. It was definitely too fast to be an airplane and the neon-blue/lights as well as fact that it disappeared made me frightened at first, but then curious so I sat there for another half an hour hoping to see something else.

It hoverd silent and motionless except for the lights that were &quot;dancing&quot; on it. It almost sparkled. I went inside a grabbed some binoculars for a better look. Through the binoculars the light seemed to change shape, moving from one light and seperating into two, and back again. We were unable to notice this change with the naked eye. This took place over a period of about 30 minutes. Getting tired of sharing a pair of bi-nocs, I went inside to grab second pair. Upon my return my wife stated that the light had seperated in two,(this time visable with the naked eye), and slowly decended in tandom behind the mountains not to be seen again.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been looking at Venus.

I was observing the Ring Nebula in Lyra with my 8&quot; Orion reflector telescope and as I looked up at the sky I saw a very slow moving object heading east to west. I first spotted it coming from the Northern Cross and followed it across the sky till it disapppeared over the western horizon. My best view of it was in the Constellation Hercules. The object was Cylinder shaped, dark gray or black finish. I saw no reflection or any lights on it. I am guessing at altitude but would say about 1500 ft. I did not see any wings, tail fins or engine pods and it was silent. My first thought was that it was a blimp but ruled that out.

A beautiful night here in Wisconsin.  I had spent the early morning installing solar patio lights, and my wife wanted me to come outside and view my handiwork first hand.  After viewing the great job I did installing the lights, she looked up at the clear sky and said...its beautiful, look at all the stars!..

I started flying when I was 18 years old and I am now 39.   I started in General Aviation and today my job is a First Officer flying passenger jets for a regional air carrier.  I know the characteristics of aircraft and how they behave. This was no aircraft.  My wife and I both watched the object as it moved from WSW to ENE....and then it turned 90 degrees left (North) and maintained the same rate of speed.  It made the turn instantaneously.  I  mean like a 90 degree turn that you would draw on a piece of paper.  No aircraft that I know about can do that.  As a member of AMSAT, I also know satellites and how they perform.   Satellites don&apos;t make 90 degree turns either.  There were no NAV lights or strobes, just a ball of white light. I would estimate that its altitude at above 60,000 feet.  In fact when it went by, I pointed and showed my wife and said look honey a satellite...and then about 10 seconds later in the blink of an eye.....it turned 90 degrees and disappeared from view within about 20 seconds.  The luminosity of the object never faded.  There was no sound or trail as with a meteor or bolite.  In 21 years of flying professionally, I have never seen anything like I saw tonight.((NUFORC Note:  The International Space Station passed to the south of Racine at 20:10 hrs. on this date, so if the time estimate by the witness is correct, the object could not have been the ISS.

I looked up in the sky, the sky was clear,but looked like down 10 miles down by Palos Hills there were a few small clouds and one 150 foot cloud looked as if a hoving disk drove thru the cloud twice on each end side going up or down on the right and left side of this 150 foot looking cloud. The burnout hoving marks on the left and right side of the 150 foot cloud had the same length width and height of 35 feet. Making the hoving burnout look as if it strach the cloud on each side. I seened these marks on this cloud thats why Iwas looking up in the sky. The cloud looked as if the cloud was the length of 150 feet from left to right,by width on 60 feet going up and down,the girth of the cloud seemed to be 270 feet. As I was driving still down 95st looking at the cloud for 15 seconds while glancing up and down trying to not get in no car accident maintaining the 30mph I stoped at a red light glancing back at the cloud I watched a polish waxed silver 1950&apos;s looking u.f.o disk smaller than the ufo hoving type cloud streching burnout marks I saw, it looked like a real small version of the 1950&apos;s looking u.f.o. it was so far looked to be at least 5 to 10 feet in height and 7 to 13 in length from right to left. When I was at the red light I watch the disk 30 feet from the right side of the cloud driving in a straight line from right to left enter the 150 foot cloud then disappeared in cloud at speeds of 100 miles per hour in the middle of the cloud I seened it in the middle of the cloud still moving in the same 100 mph speeds for 2 seconds still driving left. The light turned green,I continued to drive expecting to see the disk agian,thinking at 100 mph it would of been out of the 150 foot length cloud by now,glanced and stared at the cloud for 15 minutes on the way to work and the disk never cam out of the cloud from the left side as I was driving. This is the 3rd time I seened something,but this is my 1st I reported.

Looked like it was studing planes the way they take off I seened it with a kindergarten teacher. It also seemed as if it had some kind of capacity camalflog disappear and reappear and was having technicial diffaculties with his camelflog. I could see ripple of waves on the liquid moving. At one point it looked like the cartoons surfboard the silver surfer.", "Star turns to Sphere and takes offI saw a very peculiar object tonight. It was around 8:30 P.M.. We had just finished dinner and I went out on our porch to have a cigarette. We live in a second story apartment in Torrington, Ct. Our house faces almost directly Southeast. We get an excellent, almost unobstructed view of the sky. I am an avid sky-watcher and have enjoyed amateur astronomy from a very young age. I know most of the constellations in the sky on sight. Other than some clouds on the horizon to the Northeast, the sky was clear tonight with good visibility. I sat down to enjoy my smoke when I noticed what at first I thought was a very bright 1st magnitude star. It was about 30 degrees above the Southeast horizon. At first I thought good, it is clear and will be a good night for looking at stars. But then it struck me that this bright star was out of place. This would be in the constellation Capricorn which does not have any bright stars at all. I could see the Great Square of Pegasus to my left. I could see the bright star Altair much higher in the sky and a little to my right. I could see the constellation Sagittarius low in the sky to my right. I am just telling you this so you will know I am not mistaking this object for a star. So I was confused by this &quot;star&quot; and stared at it, trying to figure out what it was. This star looked large as well, about the size of a BB held at arms length. And though it was very bright, it was not brilliant like a star. I looked at it for about 10 seconds, then I thought it started to move. There are wires from the telephone poles that run directly in front of my apartment. Using one of the wires as a reference, I could detect this object moving lower in the sky very slowly. Suddenly, it moved very quickly toward the South. As it did it decreased in brightness and faded from view. It also seemed to change from white to bluish, and then slightly green. Even as it quickly faded it was very strange. It appeared to be illuminated from within. At the last before it faded from view, it was very dimly lit and looked like a crystal ball. It looked transparent, like a globe or sphere. From the time it moved quickly till it faded out could have only been a second or two. This quick movement probably covered 10 degrees of sky. I see planes every night flying into Bradley Field in Hartford and further east to Boston or Providence. In fact, I probably saw at least 20 planes tonight. This object moved at least 4 or 5 times quicker than the planes I see. It never made a sound. This object must have been at a fairly high altitude. I ran into the house and grabbed a pair of binoculars I keep on a bookcase by the front door for stargazing. I was back out in seconds and searched the area hoping to spot the object but it was gone. I stayed out for another 30 minutes or so, but saw nothing but stars and airliners crossing the sky. This may seem like a long story for such a short sighting. But it was a very strange sight. I believe this object was under intelligent control. You even get the feeling that it knows you are watching. Wierd. This is about the 4th or 5th time I have seen these objects in my life, all quite different from one another. I can only attribute that to the fact that I spend a great deal of time looking at the sky and have all my life. I am a very down to earth person. I do not really believe in extraterrestrial life, but I cannot deny that there are some very odd objects flying around. I have my own theories about this. I think they might be spiritual in nature, but that&apos;s just my opinion. I really don&apos;t know for sure.

The movements were accompanied by altitude adjustments as well.  Movements were further characterized by rapid (erratic) changes in direction.  The object appeared to have mostly a reddish glow to it however at times it appeared yellowish.  The object appeared and made numerous movements and then vanished; however it would reappear shortly after (perhaps 15 seconds) again.

As I turned my head to face east, the light became so bright that it illuminated the inside of my car and all of the surrounding landscape in my field of vision. This white light was a gradual brightening, not a flash like you would see at a fireworks display. It was VERY bright, many times brighter than any white flash firework and also very high in the sky. Also, this event appeared very close to the local power plant (NIPSCO). I estimate that from the time I first noticed the brightening of the sky to my east until I had my head turned to look in that direction, about 2 seconds had passed. As I watched the eastern sky I never did see the source of the illumination, I could only see the illumination fading very fast. It took about 1 second for the sky to go from bright white to darkness again. Then immediately after this, a yellow / orange double streak appeared in the sky similar to a contrail but it was diffused and had &quot;sparkles&quot; inside it. This streak &quot;drew&quot; itself from the bottom (what would be closest to the ground) going UP. This streak did not come from the top of the sky going down, it appeared moving UP. I could tell this streak was very large in the sky and &quot;drawn&quot; faster than any contrail I have ever seen. The streak disappeared as fast as it came. I stopped my car to continue watching the eastern sky for about 5 minutes and no other events occured. At work, two of my friends saw the same thing and as I described it to them they both agreed that it happened just as I have said here. One of the 2 friends that saw it said that the white light illuminated the inside of his truck like an arc welder would, and he has tinted windows on his truck. Also interesting is that this friend lives about 30 miles from me and it seems we both agreed on the intensity of the light. It was VERY bright. The other friend lives even farther away from me (about 50 miles) and it illuminated his car just as brightly.I noticed here: http://www.nbc5.com/news/3846130/detail.html?z=dp&amp;dpswid=2265994&amp;dppid=65172 that there was a plane that was forced to return to O&apos;Hare airport shortly after takeoff because of flames shooting out of an engine. If you read this article you will see that this was not what I witnessed. I live about 60 miles from Chicago to the southeast. Lake Michigan is northwest from where I witnessed the event. This plane was headed to Brazil which I imagine the plane would be on a southerly course. The event took place in the eastern sky, almost due east from my position in Wheatfield, Indiana. I estimate that the streak was several miles away in the sky, maybe as far away as 50 or more miles. Also, there was no mention of a tremendously bright white light in the sky in the article. I have never seen anything so bright in the sky.The article says that a &quot;boom like thunder&quot; and explosions were heard, the event that I witnessed was completely silent as far as I could tell. Please contact me if you need further details. Also I would like to know if anyone else has reported this event to you. Incidentally, a friend of mine at work said that the local Chicago news has been reporting UFO sightings over Indiana for the last couple of weeks or so.((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.

My two granddaughters, 5 &amp; 8 were with me. As I crossed the McCullough Bridge heading north on hwy 101, I happened to look to the North East and spotted a low flying object which seemed to be coming from the Haynes inlet area traveling in a South westerly direction. It was brightly lit with many flashing lights. I thought it must be a low flying plane of some sort or even a helicopter but it just didn&apos;t look quite right. It was flying slow and low over an area of homes just above the tree line. I than lost site of it as I continued North. I noticed it again as I passed Marine Lane on my right, which leads up to an area of nice homes. It was coming back into view as it passed over the tree covered hill heading for the dunes and ocean. As I was passing Spruce road (approx. 400 feet North of Marine Lane on the left) it emerged and passed over the highway directly over my car. A strange shape, maybe wedge shaped? It was dark but I could see a large circular shape with spokes on the bottom of it. It wasn&apos;t a helicopter for sure, and if it was a plane, it was not like any I have seen. It was flying very slow and it was quiet, no sound. I am reluctant to talk about this because I would think many people would have seen it - it was so visible, but there have been no reports of anything strange. It was very near the North Bend Airport, yet it was not in any flight path to land, it was headed toward the ocean. If anyone else saw this, please post it. It would be comforting to know if someone else saw this.", "As I was walking down my dark driveway one evening in New York I looked up and saw this huge horseshoe shaped object just above the trees.

I saw past a model plane and spotted a clear sphere in the direction of Denmark Hill as viewed from a little north of the old control tower e&#x5C;west of the main strip. It seemed far away and was traveling east-South East straight and level flight. Its size was 3mm diameter as measured with the fingers at full arms length. Its height was about 20 degree above horizon. Its appearance was of a glass ball in that I could see the complete spherical outline with the left side being slightly brighter. This agrees with where the sun was (not sure of the time as I did not take my watch that day, however the program (I have a copy) states that the model aircraft were on from 10:41am to 11:05am.   Here is more on the actual sequence and timing of my observation:    Spotted it while looking at a model (large model, 1-2 meters across) from a distance of about 50 meters.I stopped following the model (from left to right) and watched it intently for about 5-8 seconds and then I deliberately looked away while closing and rolling my eyes.Looked back; I could not see it straight away: perfectly clear sky;  nothing to focus on anywhere so I strained and then I caught it (10 seconds later) again, now it was smaller and seemed further away and was blending into the blue of the sky.It only dawned on me then that I had my 35mm SLR and a 200mm lens with me so I quickly opened  the bag, fitted the 200mm (took about 15 seconds) looked up and tried and tried to see it again but could not. I raised the camera up and looked through the lens (only slight advantage for the eyes in object size but screens out side light) but to no avail.  What a bummer! If only I had prepared my camera upon arrival I reckon I would have caught it and at a size that would blow up nicely!      My feelings are as follows:  It was not a balloon due to its straight and determined flight path, its speed, and its size which is difficult for me to work out though it gave me the immediate impression that it was large, say 3 plus meters across. This impression was formed due to my experience of observing aircraft at altitude and distance (ex RAAF and keen follower of Air Force displays) and my rather good view over the Amberley area from my street in Sadliers Crossing.It seemed rigid, as if it was a solid globe structure.It did not immediately cause me to think it was unusual as I have seen much in the way of junk flying around in the sky especially paper and plastic bags! It was the fact that it was so straight and purposeful in flight that grabbed my interest.    Logical answers. Nuh. Can&rsquo;t think of any.  And I&rsquo;ll tell you what it reminded me of, early in the peace - that shot of the ball flying across the fields in the crop circles documentary that is available on DVD! Except the object I saw was much clearer than the one as presented on that DVD and traveled dead straight!

He asked what aircraft were in the air. We replied that all aircraft were on the ground, except for a F86 fighter jet that was inbound from March AFB, Riverside California that was due in in about 45 mins. All eyes were trained towards Las Vegas with binoculars and saw nothing, but shortly, coming around Sunrise Mountain, which is a 5000 foot mountain located five miles East of the field, was a very silvery disc shaped aircraft about 500 feet above the ground trailing a vapor trail. We were all in awe, especially the vapor trail at that low altitude in the dry desert air and the craft was mirroring the orange sun, which was setting in the West. The craft stopped and hovered at the end of the East/West runway about a mile from the tower at about 200 feet and remained there for about twenty minutes. There is no other way to describe this object other than a very shiny disc with no other chararistics like windows, doors, antennae etc. Following the period of time that it hovered at the end of the runway, it started moving again, trailing vapor again and passed over the highway West of the field. It made three circles and a circular ring of vapor and hovered again about two miles West and the vapor dissipated. The sun now set behind the sheep mountains and the craft was no longer mirroring the setting sun, now looking like an ominous dark object.

The lights flight path seemed to be crossing the flight paths of the air traffic.My guess on the altitude was about 10,000 - 15,000 feet, and there were no clouds to interrupt our sighting.  We used a pair of binoculars to try to determine what the light was, and all we could see was a very bright light traveling in front of a star filled sky.  As we determined that it wasn&apos;t a plane, and way too low to be a satellite, it started pulsing then dimmed for about 3-4 seconds turning a soft redish color; and then it just vanished in the area of the constellation of Cassiopeia.  I used the binoculars to try and see if it was still visible, but I couldn&apos;t see anything moving among the star filled background.The speed seemed to be about the same as a mid-altitude airliner, and the direction was steady.

It just appeared,midway in the sky, stayed for 10 to 15 seconds, very bright (the brightest light in the sky) and then quickly dimmed and vanished.  It reappeared maybe 10 seconds later in the same spot only to once again dim and vanish.

That group of 3 lights reappeared  further to the east of where it previously was, and remained in the same formation for a few more minutes until a 4th light appeared.  It was then that the first light we saw straight to the west reappeared.  Both groups of lights remained visible for several more minutes until the westward light dimmed and vanished, and the group of 4 vanished a minute after that.  The light to the west reappeared after a few minutes, followed a minute later by the group of lights, now 3 again in the same original formation... one light with another directly above it and another above and to the right of that one.  The single light vanished after a few minutes, and the trio a minute after that.  That was the last to be seen of the single westward light.  The group to the SW reappeared, in the same formation while 2 more lights appeared slightly eastward of those.  These 2 groups of lights acted exactly like the first... the westward light(s) would dim and vanish and the SW group would vanish soon after. All of these lights would pulse with brightness, and would have periods of solid brightness.  They all vanished and did not return, but now a single light would appear from the south and slowly grow brighter and slightly gain in elevation.  At the closest point (still too far to be determined), you could see colors of red, blue and green pulsating around the main white w/orange  light.  The colors could be seen with the naked eye, and confimed all that much more with binoculars.  That object would vanish and reappear several times, and even sped west to east quickly but shortly, sped back to the west and even at one time &quot;danced&quot;... very quickly speeding in an abstract pattern only to vanish again.  This all took place over a course of 2 1/2 hours, beginning at 8:00pm. and when we left at 10:30, the time between sightings was getting longer.

He stated that the &quot;fire&quot; which he thought he was seeing turned out to be three huge bubble shaped lights on the bottom of a giant triangular craft, moving straight at his location quite slowly, maybe 40-50 mph and at treetop level. He became afraid and started to run but then realized that there was nowhere to run to.The craft passed directly over him and he stated that the lights which were burning brightly, lit the bottom of the craft and he could plainly see rib-like structures evenly spaced across the object, having the greatest definition along the centerline of the craft. he also stated that the object covered the entire sky and appeared to be several hundred feet wide and also equally long. The craft was described as being highly reflective, metallic.As the craft passed over him, he states that the sound seemed to reverberate through his body, described as a low frequency throbbing hum.

A diamond shape craft was flying from south to north at a very high rate of speed.I also saw jetliners flying below the object at almost A stand still compared to the speed of the object , The object was like a pyramid with 5 lights on each outer wall   and 3 lights in the center I live on alki beach it was very clear out not a cloud in the sky .I have never seen anything like this in my life , the craft came to a dead stop over the water just north of down town Seattle then it broke apart into 15 brite beams of lite or seperate round objects that spiraled up and vanished within 10 seconds I thought whatever it was I was looking at was gone but I kept looking up shocked by what I had just seen , that&apos;s when the lights came back in to a perfect diamond or what I like to call it a Pyramid shape in the same spot it had stoped . Then the craft started spinning very fast it was very hard to look at I felt dizzy just looking at it and the way it moved the entire time it had a slight wobble to it , when it was in pyramid form . The object was spinning so fast the lights appeard to become a solid circular shape then the object must have stoped spinning because it took off north again in the pyramid shape. I did not see the change between the spin and the movement northward because it all seemed to be one motion , The craft took off north at the same high rate of speed I had first seen it flying at, it was gone in about 15 seconds. I kept looking up in the sky and I saw a single round light come from the east and another single round light come from the west, they met at the same place the larger craft had stoped.Then the two crafts spun around each other in a cicular motion they formed a solid circle of light then shot up into the sky in a matter of seconds they were gone . and I am still shocked they say you have to see it to believe it well I&apos;ve seen and I believe what I saw was nothing I&apos;ve ever seen or heard of.

We were camping on a rise above the Delaware River with the tent fly open and were looking almost directly across at the light. Then a bright red glow started to shine that was almost like a sun rise and we saw the Black solid body with a flat top, concave sides and a srtight botton that was longer than the top. The red glow clearly outlined this large sturture. The glow plused and dimmed so that the object was lost in the haze. Then the light returned and we were able to again see the object.

At first it was only the white sphere (very clearly outlined), and then , it seemingly suddenly (See below.) &apos;generated&apos; the strange (seemingly high-speed pulsing at maybe 10-12 Hz) column beneath it. There was no wobble, pendulation, pitch, or roll that I could detect.  It remained perfectly stable and vertical at all times, while traveling at about ninety degrees to the rather brisk wind.  It made a sharp and substantial change (but a bit less than ninety degrees) in course, suddenly, at about 40% up the vertical component of its course. It disappeared due to altitude at about 80 degrees elevation in my ~ south-east.  Sphere became brighter as it sped up and with distance, but the electric blue column seemed to keep a constant light level. Attached are, (1), how it looked before extending the column, and, (2), a version of how the object looked after the electric blue column was extended.  One comment: That drawing of the sphere, alone, does not show the thing nearly as clearly as the actual view I had of it.  The edges were very sharp, and clear as could be -- much sharper than the moon&apos;s edge on the clearest of days, because it was so close. Until the object climbed very high (almost vertically), it was of sufficient angular size as to be seen quite sharply and distinctly.  The white, spherical object had NO COLUMN WHATSOEVER until I took my eyes off it for a moment because a car in the parking lot honked near me, and when I looked back up after only a couple of seconds, the strange column was there!  No camera with me. :(    I&apos;d have gotten some spectacular, sharp  images, otherwise.  At closest, the sphere, per se, subtended at least half a degree (moon or sun angular  size), but as you can see, the electric blue column made its vertically subtended arc larger. The initial sighting location was a few blocks W-SW of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, and would guess the object made its direction change when it was approximately right over the space flight center. Come to think about it, that would possibly have been what it was over when the electric blue tube beneath the object appeared, but I would caution against any undue speculation about what, if anything, it might have been doing over Goddard.  Of one thing I am certain, it did not come from there, because I am quite familiar Goddard. I waited, overnight, to report this until the drawings were complete, wanting to make the drawings while while what I saw was very fresh on my mind.

I think the reason that we see the same sightings quite often is because we are star gazers. I couldn&apos;t possibly count how many crafts I have seen, but I know it would be over 50. I just now found this site, so I thought I would report my sightings that I have had over the years. The first time I seen these ufo&apos;s was when I had just got a brand new telescope for christmas in Hawaii. I decided to take it out the night I got it to look at the moon. I was amazed by the detail I could see with the telescope, and I even got to see Saturn behind the moon. After I had my fun with looking at the moon and Saturn, I was packing up the telescope pieces and loosening the scope positioner. I looked up for a second to just gaze at the stars and wonder whats out there, when I seen a light, which I thought may have been an airplane at first. I stared at it for a while waiting to see the lights blink, but it never happened. I continued to watch as it went further and further. I called to my Step-brother to come look at what I was seeing. He was amazed by it also, and we both noticed that it seemed to be slowing down. It slowed down to where it looked like it was not moving at all, and then made about a 90 degree turn and headed south of the island of Oahu. After about 30 seconds it sped up, and left nothing but a streak of light across the sky that laster for about 2 seconds. We were both stunned by this, and talked about it the whole night we stayed up.We have also had an ocassion where a number of people seen what we spotted. One night one of our neighbors were having a party for their friends daughter&apos;s birthday, and me and by step-brother were told to come over. We hung out by the trampoline, and talked with all the other teens there. We ended up getting on the topic of UFO&apos;s some how, and that led me to tell my story of what me and my step-brother had seen. After I told the story we all looked up and I noticed, out of the corner of my eye, a small-bright object going very fast. This was very different than the first one I had seen because it was more hostile. It was moving in a violent way, zig-zagging, and turning sharp. I told everyone to look to where I was pointing, which was West of Oahu. An overwhelming fear came over the crowd as they looked at the object. We continued to watch, and more gazers came out to see what we were looking at. That same night, when me and my step-brother left the party and were on our way home, we both happened to be looking north-west, when we seen what looked to be an explosion, or super nova of a star. It lasted for only a split second, but was so bright that I could still see it do to the strain it put on my eyes. We didn&apos;t have any other reports of it on the news, and I wondered why. It had to have been seen by more people than just me and my brother.There are many more sightings of UFO&apos;s that I have seen, but they will not be described here, as there is too many to remember.

It was quite misty at the time being a typical lovely english late summer / early autumn morning and quite still and quiet. I could also liken the sound to wind howling around a building, but with no wind today at all. I can&apos;t stress enough that this sound was extremely loud for quite a few minutes, enough to wake my wife up, and quite unlike any sound I&apos;ve ever heard in my life before.", "At approximately 20:35hrs greater than what conventional aircraft (40+ thousand feet) a brightness of two very strong white lights appeared amongst the clear night starry skies.  I was was not looking up however the sudden brightness brought my attention to the stars.  For about 35-40 seconds the objects lights were very, very bright and moving slowly east, northeast and &quot;away&quot; from earth, then began to dim over the remaining minute of viewing time until they became less viewable and dimmer.  Both objects appeared in unisen in their movements.  The objects were not traveling across the skyline, yet just slightly in a direction away from earth.  About one minute after their dissapearance, another object travelled from s/east to n/west as a whitish, redish, orange light which did not have the characteristics of a &quot;shooting star&quot; at all and was much faster than a satelite.  This object traveled in a straight line and did not vary in brightness and did not appear to be encountering earths atmosphere.  My wife would neither agree or disagree that these objects were not of our planets origin and jokingly says that if they are visitors from another part of the universe they likely decided to leave as soon as they got here because of what they found....  I laughed, however I beleive this siting has merit as UFO&apos;s and will watch this site for other reports.", "Large Rectangle UFO floating over north Charlotte, NCI was driving north on I-85 approaching the UNC Charlotte campus.  Traffic was heavy during the 5 o&apos;clock rush hour.  I was going about 15 mph.  Suddenly in the sky ahead of me about 1/2 mile away appeared a large gray rectangle.  I estimate it&apos;s length as long as a football field.  It was gray with panels that were somewhat reflective.  It floated motionless and then drifted to the right.  I lost sight of it behind the tree line as I drove along.  I had time to remove my sunglasses so I watched it for approximately 10 seconds. As I drove along toward the campus, there were several auto accidents.  I can&apos;t explain what I saw.", "Pulsating lights dance over Kansas City&apos;s downtown Exhibition Center.Sighting:  Thursday Evening, September 9, 2004.Very clear sky, stars easily visible, single-engine plans and one helicopter clearly visible during sighting. I&apos;m a 37-year old (male) design architect that has lived and worked in downtown Kansas City,Missouri for 14 years for the same company.  I live with my wife and 3 year old son near Raytown, Missouri, a 30 minute drive from downtown.  On the evening of September 9th, at approximately 11:30 PM, I was leaving my office to go home.  I park my car in a free-standing parking garage (3 story structure) immediately to the northwest of our office building.  To the west of our office building, in a two block area, is the downtwon Convention Center, Exhibition Center, and Municipal Auditorium.  The Exhibition Center is a prominent feature in the KC skyline with its large suspension structure and four stainless steel &quot;futurist&quot; sculptures artifically lit from within and below (refer to attached images).  These art pieces were erected in the mid-1990&apos;s to crown the Exhibition Center and symbolize Kansas City&apos;s aspirations for a bright and progressive future.  Naturally, working downtown all these years, I tend to take them for granted, but on the referenced evening I happened to look up at them while walking to my car.  I noticed a number of small point-sources of light moving above and behind the main sculpture on the east-most pylon.  At first I thought the light objects were a swarm of bugs attracted to the sculpture lights, but it became clear (even from my vantage point on the ground) that the light objects were too big and solitary to be swarming insects.  I stopped and looked more critically now thinking the lights must be the under-belly of pigeons or some other large birds illuminated by the sculpture&apos;s lights as they flew over.  I almost walked away and went home at this point but just before I turned to go I noticed the light objects didn&apos;t dim or disappear into the darkness as they moved away from the sculpture&apos;s light array.  In fact, some of them got brighter and grew in size as they moved away.  This peaked my interest so I decided to go up to the top level of the parking garage and get a better look.  Sure enough, from this elevated vantage point, I could clearly see as many as ten illuminated objects moving in random patterns what appeared to be directly above the Exhibition sculptures.  I still thought these might be birds so I watched carefully for any unusual behavior.  My first observation was to try and determine if these objects were self-luminous or simply reflecting light from the street or sculptures.  Without question, they clearly demonstrated they were the former.  This became most apparent when some of the objects made hard, angular cuts, they became much brighter and changed color (from a bright white dot to a larger arc of yellow and orange light).  Then the light would diminish and sometimes simply disappear.It&apos;s important to note this light behavior occurred over, behind, and away from the sculpture lights.  No obvious connection could be made between a reflective object and the sculpture lights given their changing proximity to the Exhibition Center.In most cases, the light objects were roughly twice as large and bright as any other fixed light in the night sky.  When they cut at sharp angles or accelerated, their light intensity and relative size grew to roughly thre to five times that of any fixed light in the sky.  Because it was such a clear and cool evening, I feel very confident about the accuracy of these comparisons.  In addition to demonstrating self-illumination, I also observed these objects manuever in patterns no normal aircraft (and, frankly, no bird) could possible duplicate.  The objects moved with a mixture of chaotic zig-zags, dips, jumps, straigt-line accelerations, stationary pauses, collision course acrobatics, etc. etc.  This activity was sustained and though apparently random, demonstrated intelligent control.  At one point (around midnight) a single-engine plane, presumably leaving the downtown airport, made a straight line path through the light objects.  At this point, I would estimate six to eight objects moving in the area just over the Exhibition Center.  From my vantage point, the plane appeared to be a few hundred feet lower than the objects (which assumes the objects were a few thousand feet in altitude).  However, it appeared as though the light objects moved farther apart as the plane entered my field of view.  Then, they resumed their dance back over the sculptures.  Several other small planes came through the same area, as did one police helicopter, but the objects didn&apos;t adjust their position for these craft.  I literally watched this go on for a solid hour totally amazed by what I was seeing.  Taking their self-illumination, changing illumination, and manueverability, I had to conclude these were not terrestrial-based craft or animals.  Clearly, these weren&apos;t ballons, ball lighting, or swamp gas either.  They were something I can&apos;t explain.  All I could think was these objects are playing with each other whatever they are.  Like some nutty game of high-speed cat-and-mouse, they looked like kids let out to play.  That&apos;s the best description I could come up with.  And more importantly, they decide to play with unabashed clarity over one of the most visible monuments in a populated city.  You couldn&apos;t miss them if you tried, they were that close and that visible. To get a better look, I got in my car and drove a block south to a large surface parking lot that is a bit higher in elevation than the top of the parking garage and less affected by street lights.  I thought this would help me determine the actual position of these objects relative to the Exhibition sculptures.  From this position, I could sse the objects even better.  They were indeed flying directly over and to the west of the Exhibtion Center.  Some of them would dart off in all directions and disappear, only to reappear near where they disappeared.  Others continued this amazing light display during acceleration and hard turning.  I could see the color changes much better from this darker position.  When the objects intensified, they looked like what you see when a rotating steel blade heats up due to friction.  They had a pronounced rim of orange light that lasted a few seconds then they would turn yellow or white and I also noticed a little bit of red.  I could also tell the light pulsated softly as they moved in a linear direction.  I heard no noise from these objects which is odd given how fast they were clearly moving.  On a whim, I grabbed a flashlight from my car and &quot;signaled&quot; toward the moving lights.  I don&apos;t know Morse Code but I thought if these objects are guided by some intelligence, perhaps they&apos;ll see my light and signal back or do something to let me know they see me (foolish, I know).  Seeing a grown man flashing a light in the night sky might give some pause to think I&apos;m nuts, but this was an extraodinary event.  I did this for about 30 more minutes and decided to go home.  The lights were still zigging and zagging as I drove away, still pulsing and blinking out of sight.  It was quite the event, I&apos;ll never forget it.((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS))Peter, I just confirmed with a really good pair of binoculars that the objects I saw the other night over downtown Kansas City are in fact birds and not unexplainable objects.  I&apos;m terribly sorry for jumping the gun and making a report that turned out to be something so simple and quite natural.  Please disregard my sighting. I&apos;ll be more cautious in the future.

At first my logical conclusion was that this phenomenon was merely an air plane or a sattelite, however, after a prolonged staredown I realized that this phosphoresent blob in the night&apos;s sky was moving at an irregular and unpredictable pattern.  The star-like figure would remain static, flickering with coloration and then would suddenly--not to mention erratically--begin to whimsically gyrate in no measurable pattern.  These movements took on many directions--spiral, circular, up-and-down, and horizontal--in a random fashion.  After approximately 25-30 minutes of viewing this abnormal astral occurrance the intensity of the light emanating from the object began to taper off, and eventually the phenomenon departed entirely over the westward horizon.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we reached the tentative conclusion that he might have been observing a twinkling star.

Looking at the clear night sky, I noticed a bright flashing light low in the western sky; given the date, I was more attentive than usual.  Since we see a lot of air traffic out of Mercer County Airport (not far to our west) and elsewhere in the NY-PA area, I first assumed it was a plane, but glancing back once or twice I noticed that it didn&apos;t appear to be moving.  I guessed it was a trick of perspective, but after five or ten minutes I felt something must be amiss, so I went to grab my only -- and unfortunately low-resolution -- pair of binoculars.  It was larger than a star and flashed much more rapidly, again, like an airplane, and in multiple colors as well.  All that I was able to make out was a stationary object emitting a bright white light accompanied by intermittent red and blue flashes.  My wife confirmed this sighting and feels as clueless about it as I.  I checked on its status repeatedly, and the object continued to hover for well over an hour, although the last few times I checked it appeared to have lowered imperceptibly toward the western horizon until, between 10:30 and 10:45, it had sunk out of my viewing area behind trees and houses.  There was frequent air traffic in the area, and a few planes even seemed to pass close by the object without any change of course.  My eye isn&apos;t well-trained enough to get any sense of how far away the object may have been; west of here is, again, the airport, and not far beyond that the Delaware River and Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

At one point when there the largest number of lights, I could hear what you would pass off as airplane noise, but too loud for no real close airplane to be seen.  Several were gathered near each other when the most spectacular display occurred.  At three different areas in the southern sky (at the same time), gatherings of orange lights occurred.  The gathering I focused on formed into four orange lights in a perfect horizontal line.  From my peripheral view I could see other gatherings moving.  Then they faded out.  They were in view for probably 6-7 seconds.  From then on, I watched 2-3 blinking lights move around the whole horizon, ending up back in the southern sky.

When I first noticed it in the distance, I thought at first someone was burning something and it was ash floating in the air, but quickly realized it was too solid to be ash.  I noticed a man in a car that I did not recognize stopped in front of my driveway to stick his head out of the window and looked up.

At first I thought they were kites or mylar balloons.  They appeared to tilt and roll, which I attributed to the very slight wind, and I do mean slight.

We decided to head back home on our &quot;atv&quot; - [all terrain vehicle], as we were on the trail which is about 20 kilometres from the community, I was a passenger on the &quot;atv&quot;, as we were riding hard I then had to go to the &quot;little boy&apos;s room&quot;, to take a leak, as I was doing my business, I was looking over the horizon - something caught the corner of my eye and it was a light, a big hovering light and it wasn&apos;t twinkling like the stars do on a clear night.  As I watched the light hovering, there was another movement right underneath the bright light and these were of different colours - 2 RED lights rotating in a clockwise direction, and they seemed to be rotating at an equal distance from each other with unexplainable speed, while this was happening another 3 lights appeared or seemed to come out of the bright light at a phenomal speed and they were smaller than the &quot;mother ship&quot; but they were the same size as the 2 red ones that were rotating.  As we were watching the lights and marvelling at the rate of speed they were showing, 3 &quot;atv&quot;&apos;s appeared on the trail going home on a fishing/hunting trip.   As we were looking on, the lights then stopped on what they were doing, as they seemed to notice the atv&apos;s.  The lights then headed towards the oncoming atv&apos;s and proceeded to go towards them, then when they came upon the atv&apos;s they started to hover above them and followed there every move.  As we were watching them, I jokingly said &quot;Oh no, they&apos;re going to be abducted by the lights!&quot;  As we were watching the atv&apos;s go on, the lights were moving on as they seemed to lose interest atv&apos;s.  Back to the original spot where we had just watched them.  I then said to my friend that we should wait for the atv&apos;s to see if they noticed anything up in the sky.   We decided to wait for them, the first 2 atv&apos;s just passed us and didn&apos;t stop, seeing this, I decided to flag down the 3rd atv - he stopped.  My first question was &quot;Did you see the lights?&quot;  The driver seemed to be perplexed as I asked the question,  &quot;What lights?&quot;, he said.  I then went on to tell him that they were being followed by the lights for about a minute, and the lights moved on, he looked at me as if I was a madman and he drove off.  As the other 3 atv&apos;s were on the trail we were behind them and they had stopped for a cigarette, meanwhile, I kept looking behind us, above us, and all around, I then noticed the lights going in a northerly direction while these other guys were stopped, I tried to show the other 2 drivers but they weren&apos;t the least bit interested and didn&apos;t see what I was trying to show them, until I went over to the 3rd driver who proceeded to ask me where I was seeing the lights, I then pointed towards the lights and he saw them.  I was happy or relieved that one of them saw the lights.  To this day I can only say that I have seen something not of this world.", "Two fast as a couple moving red lightsI was smoking a sigaret in my garden at +/- 21.45 hours and i&apos;m looking up and see two red circle shaped lights moving verry fast simultaniously to the east.When they were gone after +/- 5 seconds i notice that two planes i see in the sky are much smaller and apperently much further away, but i didn&apos;t here a sound when the lights were moving by.

Also the shape would change from saucer to round to triangle at one point it looked like a circle with holes in it almost like a smile face.  It just was very odd almost like a lazer light show.  She did get it on video and called a couple freinds to see it too, I saw the tape and I cant explain it.

We turned to look where he pointed,and we all saw the two objects,we confirmed with each other that yes,we saw these things. They looked like two cylinder shaped objects,that were either white or silver gray color,and were moving nearly alongside each other at what appeared to be a normal speed.

Now just within this past week or so, on or around October 3rd or 4th,2004 my friend and I saw what appeared to be the same type of object in the sky. This was just about a week ago. We were coming out of a local store and putting our items in the car trunk when he said to me &quot;Look! There&apos;s that funny looking thing again!&quot; He pointed towards the East in the sky,and it did look like the same type of object we had seen in August. This time we only saw one,and it was traveling across the sky at a normal pace where it could easily be seen by anyone who was looking in that direction.

When we got there at about 23:00 hours we could see three of them come from the west to the east. They seemed to stop over the Superstition Mountians. They stopped in mid air and then went to the south and then very fast up to the east. They would stop and hover and go up and down and left and right. Then all at once there was a larger one that seemed to come up in front of us (we were facing the east) it was larger and brighter than the others.It went to the right and then stopped.It looked to both of us like a deep v. It was strobing red and blue. It would move all around and then it looked as if it was coming closer to us. We saw a total of 6 in the air. I have spent a lot of time watching the ski for the falling stars. I have never seen anything like this. It gave me a sense of fear and excitment.

The second photo was taken approx 1 minute later, showing the UFO at a slightly different angle, showing a definite metallic reflection. A very interesting point to be made here is that given that both photos are approx 1 minute apart, it is not reasonable to say the UFO was travelling at high speed to avoid detection by the human eye. Also, given that I did NOT see this aircraft that day, I have come to the conclusion that it had a &quot;camouflage&quot; of some sort - which was somehow not effective on the flash of a camera, even though it was a disposable camera! Given the photo timing, I&apos;d say it travelled at a fairly low speed, and low altitude as can be seen by the photos.

At first I thought it was possibly a mylar balloon(the type you get for a childs birthday) but I noticed a light aircraft below the orb, way below the orb! I called the manager over to observe it and he was also astounded by it. It was stationary from when I first  observed it until it started moving(drifting?) slowly from east to west. The stationary position lasted about 2 minutes. We observed several commercial jet aircraft on flight paths directly below it also. I can easily say the the orb was about 10,000 to 20,000 feet up. It drifted then for approx. 10 more minutes and stopped for about 30 seconds and vanished from my sight. What is very strange is that it just disappeared. It didn&apos;t shoot up furtherinto the distance or zoom off, it just disappeared. Vista is south of Camp Pendelton Marine base. I would say that it was over the southern area of the base or near the boundary. I also wonder if it was some sort of observation platform they are experimenting with.

I had a camp fire light and hanging lantern light in my eyes and still saw this extremely bright blue-white light appear in the sky at about 35 degrees above the horizon almost directly east of our position. I called my wife to look and she and a son of 11 also saw it. It became extremely bright and huge, probably four times the size of the glowing Saturn. Then as if clicked off, it turned to a dot like the smallest star in the sky and turned southward. It proceeded that direction appearing as a satellite, until we lost sight of it. It made no sound and had no other disquishing lights such as wing markers or strobes on an aircraft as we know. Then again on the next evening about 30 minutes later, the light appeared in the same area, shining through a layer of clouds. I could see no other stars in the sky due to the clouds. Again there was no noise or other lights. This time two other adults saw it. When the bright light dimmed as it did the previous night, we could not track it due to the clouds. Then on the night of the 19th of August we had company of two attorneys and one of their spouses at our camp. They were all from New Mexico. We were eating a late meal when we heard two loud booms like dynamite going off in the sky followed by a three thunderous, rolling booms that shook the earth, trees and camp tent. The enormous thunderous roll then turned to a vibrating thunder sound which then receded. I have never in my 60 years heard anything to compare this vibrating thunder sound with. I am also a pilot and have heard sonic booms. This was almost frightening in comparison.Relatives of ours also heard this noise 20 miles distant but thought it was thunder as they were inside their homes. Another ranch couple only a few miles away were rattled in their bed by what they could only describe as thunder from somewhere. We at the camp had a clear view of the entire night sky and there was not a cloud from horizon to horizon. I have no idea what any of this was including the light.

I immediately got my field glasses and trained them on this orb, which appeared sparkly with refracted light, like a diamond.  I put my field glasses down and it was then that I noticed that this was not the only orb of light in the sky.  I began to count and saw that there were between 11 and 13 other orbs of light that were hanging, motionless and soundless, in the sky to the south of the first one.  There was at least one more light  far to the left of the first one to the north.  The other orbs had a softer glow to them, perhaps because the sky was slightly more overcast to the south.  The orbs to the south were in an odd formation that actually looked, on closer inspection, like the big dipper constellation.  (I can say with certainty that I was not viewing the constellation itself; I know what stars in the night sky look like and they are considerably smaller than these orbs.  Furthermore, the amount of light pollution in New York, even at 5:00 in the morning, and the fact that it was somewhat cloudy and overcast, would make it impossible to clearly see any astronomical phenomena easily, or even at all.)

It was 4:00 pm and a clear, sunny day.  My dad (age 61) was across the street from his house with two neighbor girls (both under the age of five years old) and they were looking up in the sky eastward.  My dad had his binoculars and I thought he was looking at a plane or a bird.  As I got out of my car he called for me to come over and take a look at what he was seeing.  There was a jet passing overhead that was quite high in the sky, and I initially thought he was looking at the plane with the two neighbor kids.  He told me to look up toward the plane, and I did, thinking the plane was the object we were focusing on.  In actuality, it wasn&apos;t the plane, but what looked like three twinkling stars in the area of the plane.  At first I thought the plane had dropped something and that the three objects were just debris falling from the plane.  But one twinkling object was higher in the sky than the plane.  I looked through my dad&apos;s binoculars and the objects were still tiny to my eyes, but they were still twinkling exceptionally bright in the sunny daytime.  To me they each looked like a tumbling shiny polygon of some sort.  They must have been much higher in the sky than the plane because even looking through the binoculars the objects were not more than &quot;twinkling stars&quot;.  They seemed to be reflecting light, not creating their own luminescence.  My dad said something to the effect that he thought they looked like they were tumbling down to earth, and I agreed.  Shortly thereafter, we lost sight of one object (the plane was now long gone) but the higher of the two remaining objects descended an was now holding it&apos;s place in the sky diagonally down from the other object.  Both objects which had seemed to be tumbling stopped in this position for about 45 seconds.  Then one object disappeared under the tree line (my parents live in a neighborhood with tall trees everywhere).   At this point the girls&apos; mother came out and my dad pointed out the twinkling lights to her. A few minutes later the mother took the girls inside for whatever reason.  I lost sight of the objects but my dad said he could still see one.  Since I didn&apos;t see anything anymore, I went in and got my photos and came back outside.  My dad said the last object drifted under the tree line.  He told me the objects had started out directly above him minutes before I arrived, then becan travelling slightly to the norteast (more east than north I&apos;d say).  Since I live about a mile east of my parents, I went home hoping to see the objects lower in the sky as there are few trees in my neighborhood.  It took me about 2 minutes to get home, but I saw no more of the twinkling lights.  If I were to learn that these objects were some sort of falling high altitude debris, I could certainly believe that.  However, I would be very surprised to find out they were some kind of common man-made flying machine due to their shape, their incredible brightness in a sunny sky, the odd &quot;tumbling polygon&quot; look they had, their strange movement, and the fact that they left no exhaust or trails.", "6 Birght lights similiar to the &quot;Phoenix lights&quot; of 1997, danced across the desert sky.6 bright golden lights. Seperate from one another. Perfectly angeled from one another. 2 of the lights were vertical to one another. And appeared to be seperated by at least a thousand feet. The other 4 lights if connected would have made a perfect square. Also about 1000 ft from one another. I could not tell distance at all. It was a clear night over the desert. The light could have been 5 miles away, or 30 miles. The lights then disappeared, sometimes 2 at a time, sometimes one. then would immediately appear maybe a mile to the west of where they had just been seconds before. Again perfectly spaced from one another. At one point one of the lights vanished and immediately like a strobe effect, they moved across the sky for maybe half a mile. then vanished. The lights would appear for about 5 seconds, then vanish for 10 minutes. Then show again. I have been an airline pilot for over a decade and never seen anything like this. There were no beacons, no navigation lights. These did not appear to be helicopters for they moved to smoothly through the sky with no vibration on the lights. And much to quickly.Could it have been military? Possible.

The light reappeared over the mountain, then headed south.  As this &quot;light&quot; was focused upon through the viewfinder of my camcorder, I noticed that there were two lights.  I faced first North, where the object was sighted, then Northeast as it passed in front of me heading South.  As the object came closer, I noticed three lights in a triangular formation, the two outside lights being red and the light of the corner closest to me being green.

The only way I can tell you what it was is it looked like a stick dog. It had no skin or hair just sticks shaped into a dog about 2 foot tall,and no I am not crazy!Now get this a friend of mine just moved here and 2 weeks ago we were coming home from town and it was dark as we were talking I was listening and looking at her when all at onced she hit her brakes and said oh my God I thought she almost hit a deer and she said no it was something that leaped across the road so fast that all she could tell was it was made of sticks. I then told her what had happened to me just a year back. Then I seen on my pc that somewhere in another state a party was ran out from what appeared to be stick people.

Soon it reappeared then I saw a short tail from it like it was a jet beginning to leave a contrail,however it was very short and then disappeared.  Then I saw another one and the same thing happened.

As the anomoly moved eastward slowly, it began looking more like a cloud, which was formed to this apparent shape(see attached) but being extremely dense , especially nearest the strobe.The shape was perfectly symmetrical and well defined.  The light stopped flashing after a minute or so and was no longer visible.

I heard a low humming sound very soft at first then it was a low rummbling sound and as I looked in the direction and this huge ship or craft was approached right straight across my view to the right on us.  This thing was very slow and it was very low as well about 4 hundred feet or a little more as far as I could tell by my estimation. This ship or vessel was shaped in a triangle and it&apos;s lights were glowing from underneath it an those lights seemed to alternated in a pattern as it passed over me.

I called loudly to my mom in the next room after a few moments and when this thing came over us you could only hear the light rumbleing or humm or something, you know not like normal engine propulsion.

What was so shocking about the thing was it was not a loud humm or just very little noise. my mom heard it too and we have also seen various other sitings as well in our area in the last few months, but this thing was huge.. my God what or who was flying this ship and where are they from..is it the military or what? is, well you want my oppinion? it is not the government in my view, but I don&apos;t know what this ship was, all I know it was the strangest thing I ever saw in my life...I just know this &quot;if I had not been wondering what the low humm was or had not looked up at just the moment I did, I would have never seen the thing at all I believe.", "Green light fills up skyWhile driving north on 79 out of pittsburgh we saw a huge flash of &quot;street light green&quot; then once i got to NEW CASTLE, PA i was talking to one of my friends and she was telling me that her sister had blocked her car in while she was leaving to come to my house.

I ran up the block and watched the craft as long as I could till it finely went out of site.  I asked people at the swap &amp; shop if they had seen the saucer and know one had seen anything.  I couldn&apos;t understand why or how this could be because it was about as big as the drive in itself.  The saucer was hovering over the drive in for five minutes or so then moved on west slowly.

I was listening to the program and was also emailing one of your guests, Will.  He suggested I provide a description of what I saw on August 19th, 2004. I arrived home to Chaska, MN (about 5 miles from the Chanhassen Weather Center) from a business trip to Madison, WI.  the last 110 miles of the trip heads pretty much East to West heading into and through the Minneapolis area.  As I was unloading my vehicle my neighbor stopped by (he is retired military) and we chatted a little bit.  When I asked him what I had missed the last couple of days, he pointed in the sky directly above us and said, &quot;see that, it&apos;s been in the spot since 9:00 am this morning.  I looked up in the sky and saw a very bright object, very high in the sky.  I asked hime what it was, and he said nobody knows.  He said reports had been on TV and radio, but nobody knew what it was. I ran in the house and grabbed my 10X binoculars and focused in on it.  It was very bright, light looking into a bright light and had a sloped rectangular shape (trapezoid?).  The brightness was unusual.  The light seemed to, well, move like when you look at an asphalt road and see the heat coming off the surface.  As I watched it, I noticed from the middle of the object to the bottom of it, was a grey V shape.  More like a rounded V, coming from the middle sides of the object and meeting at a point in the bottom of the object. I ran back in the house and grabbed my video recorder.  It has a 150X digital zoom.  I tried to focus on the object, but couldn&apos;t keep it steady enough as I lay on my back in my yard.  I recorded it for about a minute, then reviewed what I had recorded.  All you could see was a bright light in the sky, it did not focus very well.  So I went back to watching it through the binoculars.  The object did move a little as I watched it.  If I held my hands above my head, at a distance of about 2 feet apart, that is the distance it moved by 7:30pm.  My military neighbor came back over to my house to let me know, that if it was something unknown, he was guaranteed that there would be military jets flying around.  I just kept watching. Around 8:30, I asked another neighbor to look at the object through the binoculars and describe what he saw.  He saw it the same way as I did.  His wife looked at it and agreed.  Both were as curious as I was on what the object was. By 9:00pm, the object had continued to move (another 2 feet measured by holding my hands above my head).  As my neighbor and his wife watched with me, the sun began to sink into the horizon.  As the sun goes down, it does turn a reddish orange.  As the sun turned that color, so did the object.  Leads me to believe the object was highly reflective, and reflecting light from the sun.  As the sun went down, the moon was rising from the SW.  The moon rose and the object stayed in the same location.  Once the sun was totally below the horizon, we could no longer see the object.  Even though there was still some sunlight left in the horizon. Through the whole time I watched the object, it moved, drifted in a North to South direction.  I wasn&apos;t looking straight up in the air, but the object was about 75 degrees above the horizon. I checked for reports the next day if there were sightings to the South, like Iowa or Nebraska, and nothing was reported.  BUT, I did see reports on August 20th that an object was noticed in the skies around Phoenix.  Some of the pictures that were submitted looked very similar to what I saw.

Then it would become bright and show up on camera again. We also caught 2 other lights (orbs) hovering close to the brightest one.

As they descended they pulsated slowly in unison back and fourth from a bright red to orange in color. As they became bright red, the sky around them glowed giving them an aura. I could clearly see their shape and could tell they were not anything like a plane or helicopter. It looked to me like they were landing and I had an urge to go and investigate, but fear and the fact that it would have been a several hour hike to get to where they were kept me from doing so.

The sky was finally clear after the rain and overcast for the most part of the weekend.  I was outside of my girlfriends parents&rsquo; house having a cigarette and enjoying the peacefulness of the evening before heading off to bed.   After leaving the side-door of their house, I turned North (left) to go to the back yard.  Before I got all the way into the back yard, I paused and lit my smoke.  I then went to the fire pit (about 15 steps from door) and sat down on a bench.  I noticed that there were an extraordinary amount of stars in the sky and I couldn&rsquo;t help but look, however, I could not get the glare from a near by streetlight out of my eyes so I went and stood in the shadow of a big willow tree directly behind the house to gain a better view.It only took about 30 seconds of me being in the shadows until I seen this thing.   I was standing with my body facing North, North-West.  From where I was standing, to my left was a wooden fence found in most residential areas and to my right was a large willow tree.  Now, also from where I was, I could not see the horizon.  I could see the roof of the neighbors 2 car garage directly in front of me, behind the fence, and a row of 4-5, 50 foot Pine trees in the neighbors yard across the alley to the north.Now, as I was looking up, out of the north I heard a whooshing sound like a light breeze going through the tops of the trees or light winds blowing through taller grass.  I turned my head right and to my astonishment I seen flying from behind the trees a black triangle with 3 dimly lit orange lights on the base of it.  It moved from North to South West.  It did not make any noise.  I could see this was a 3-Dimentional object as it flew across the sky because the tail of the triangle looked like it had depth, it had what looked like columns that extended up from the base (at different angles to create X&apos;s or Diamonds) to a lip and what I would think is another surface (the top of the craft).  As it flew from my right to left I could not see depth in the &apos;nose&apos; as it was too dark and I feel the color of the craft may have blended with the night sky but I feel it could have depth as well.  As it was in front of me, I could make out a distinct triangular shape by the light reflecting off the bottom of the craft from either the lights on the ground or the 3 orange lights on its base.  As it moved farther to my left, that&rsquo;s when I could make out the tail-end and suggest that it is, in fact, 3-D.  The triangle flew like an arrow head with a point in the front.It took about 10 seconds to cover what I would estimate to be about 150KM of sky.I could only see it as it came out from behind the trees until I lost it in front of the neighbor&rsquo;s house.  I wanted to go to the front and keep an eye on it but I was petrified, literally scared stiff.  I could not move.The craft seemed to be darker in color, possibly a dark grey/black, or a charcoal color but stood out from the color of the clear night sky once a person got a bead on it.I would think it was the size of an average house but am not sure as it was some distance away (the tail-end suggested the size of a Greyhound bus).   It also seemed to be distinctly blurry or hazy compared to the sky when it was moving.  I had to &lsquo;catch-up&rsquo; to it with my eyes at least 2 times.At an arms length away, it was about the size of a book of matches and quite similar looking if you were to look at one moving from right to left at an arms length.I have made a few sketches for memory but it was quite an interesting experience I do not suspect I will forget this night for a long, long time.", "On October 24th 2004, my wife and I saw four oblong blurred lights lined up perfectly in the skyOn Sunday October 24th, as I was returning home with my family, driving west bound on 175th street between Halsted and Ashland avenues, my wife and I both saw four lights lined up in a NorthWest-SouthEast axis along the sky. a fifth light which appeared to be a plane was moving very, very slowly from the SouthWest quadrant and toward the line of lights.

It was very dark at night, and we were very clearly able to see the stars in the sky. While watching, we saw what appeared to be 3 stars moving in a straight line across the sky. Whatever the stars were, they appeared to be very, very high in the sky. Looking up, they appeared to be less than an inch from each other, but as high as they were, they could have been a couple of miles apart. I&apos;ve seen one star move before, assuming it to be a satellite or jet plane. This is the first time I&apos;ve ever seen 3 move together in what appeared to be formation. There was a single star out front and 2 other stars behind it side by side, in a triangle formation. The stars continues across the sky and we watched until we lost sight. They were travelling from southwest to northeast (into Canada)((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness means a duration of 30 seconds, not 30 minutes.  We will correspond with him to clarify that point.  If it is 30 seconds, he may have been witness to the &quot;triplet&quot; of satellites that are reported to our Center quite frequently, and which are thought to be U. S.

They were extremley sparadic which occured every few seconds with no sound what so ever. We were very interested by the light and drove up the other side of the valley to get a closer look, on the way up, we saw what seemed to be an enourmous ball of light which flew below the hill line and then shot up towards the sky and just seemed to vanish.

With my arm fully extended and my thumb up against the light, it was about 1/4 the width of my thumb. It surprised me to be where it was, I was not aware of any planet or star of such magnitude in that part of the sky. It was not flashing as an airplane light would.

We were driving on the interstate a bit after the sun had already set, and I was leaning my head on the backseat passenger window just gazing out into the sky. My father was driving, and my mother was in the front passenger seat. I soon noticed a tiny white light traveling in a sparatically upward pattern. I dismissed it as a plane, but soon realized that the craft was changing direction far too much to be any kind of passenger jet. I followed it silently as it changed direction instantly several times, trying to keep focused on it. I soon told my mother, and she noticed the craft too. We were both astonished by its irregular motion, and it soon dissapeared into the distance, as if it had suddenly shot away from us, instantaneously. But, seconds later, it re-appeared, the light was still at the same opacity, but it had re-appeared in a location far from where it had disappeared. We were both a little frightened by the reality of the situation, but it didn&apos;t cause us to jump to conclusions or anything else of that sort. We were still on the interstate, and we had told my father of the craft, but he was busy driving and was not able to get a look. My mother and I followed the craft as it seemed to stop dead in the sky. No longer than it had been motionless, it began to give off what seemed tiny little explosions. It looked like the craft was kind of popping bright shimmering fireworks. It looked much like very dim artillery shell-style fireworks blowing up right off of the craft itself. We watched this happen several times, 8-10 times. We could even see would seemed like the little embers from these explosions floating downward toward the ground. The craft continued to kind of spontaneously combust, and eventually began moving once again in its sparatic movement. We watched it move across the sky and eventually dissapear once again, all the while it was still exploding like a faint artillery shell. It eventually left our sight.", "White sphere viewed with naked eye and telescope in broad daylight was most likely a high altitude balloonA white sphere was reported on local radio to be moving against the wind above the city, despite relatively brisk winds from the west.  I observed a very small silver sphere to the east northeast at approximately 80 degrees from the horizon. The object was moving very very slowly to the southwest. The sky was clear and visiblilty was excellent from south Minneapolis. The object reflected sunlight and was not luminous. Observation of the object under 150x magnification with a refracting astronomical telescope revealed it to be a very high altitude balloon of significant size.  It was seen to slowly deform and show tension lines which shifted as it returned to its original shape.  No instrument pakage was visible.  Consultations with meterologists at the University of Minnesota confirmed that every observation I made was consistent with the behavior of a very high altitude balloon (+50000 feet), where it would not be affected by lower altitude winds, explaining its anomalous behavior in seeming to move against the prevailing wind.((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports of the same object.

After about 10 minutes of complete motionlessness, the light became brighter and brighter and started to rise.  It rose very smoothly and at first slowly, gradually increasing its ascent upwards.  The movement was mostly vertical, with a bit of angle to it.  As it got higher up, I could see vibrant orange &quot;legs&quot; stemming from the center, looking a bit like spider legs.  In the very center of the yellow circle (underneath the craft), the was a red and green small light.

As we flew from sanfran the normal turn is to the north over the city and then over oakland. just as we reached about 4500 foot the plane was forced into a hard left turn in which the food carts came loose and the overheads came open.  my shoes which were off slid accross the isle. Being in first calss I could see the panic in the eyes of the flight attendents.  Then two large ovals craft went past the right side of the plane and above us. They were much larger than our craft the first being nickel in color and the second a rust color. They were close enough to see with detail their shape and construction. Then a third craft nickel came by on the same path as the first two.I was in the window seat but the person next to me and those behind on the right side of the flight saw them.  The flight attendant tried to get the attention of the flight crew but it was some time,three or four minutes befour the crew would take their call.  There was a heated conversation and the attendants became very distrssed and talked among themeselves. The cockpit door then came open and the crew told the attendants be calm all the while one person on the crew was on the radio looking for a new flight path and seeking information on the other objects we just missed.  the door remained open and I could here conversation as how how they would fly a new route to Dallas. Later the crew all denied anything varied from the norm  and would not discuss this matter.  ON a later flight I was with the same attendtent and was reconized and was asked if I had seen them and she said we were very lucky. I have all the flight info if anyone wants to follow up. I also have photos of a craft that I took from a flight from New Mexico that was below us. This craft had triangle shape and moved from side to side as it moved to the north at a very slow speed.We saw the craft long enough for me to get my nikon from my case and take photos.

There was an airshow scheduled for that weekend in SF, as info was in the news I read prior to the flight.  I can go back through my records and get the exact date if needed.  I mean there was activity brought on by the occurrense taking place with the crew and others on the flight that took place for over one hour.  this includes the crew trying to get an ok to fly over parts of Nevada  that were not normal for the flight.  With the door open to the cabin for a period of time you could overhear the conversations taking place.  Also the attendants spoke of this to each other, about the flight being too far south of norm.Actual viewing time was short because of proximity of the three craft, at the most a few seconds.  There were no more than 1200 ft away at the most and details in the surface was obvious.  They  all had weatherbeaten look and looked very as if they had been exposed to harsh conditions. Give me a fax number and I will send a drawing of the craft.  When this started I was on the right side of the aircraft but swiched to the left window after our turn to the left and could see all three over the bay bridge moving northeast and gaining altitude and speed. they maintained this course until out of sight.((END ADDENDUM))", "Saw a blurry object in the NW sky pretty high up.

It was shaped like a triangle with bright lights at each point.  I could hear a low rumbling that got slightly louder as it flew over my building.  I could not see anything in between the lights just black, the stars were out and you could not see them between the lights,  It appeared very high up and appeared no larger than your tip would look at the and of your arm fully stretched out it also did not follow any of the flight paths that the approaching/departing planes would take.", "Over Santa Monica, Slow Moving Bright in the AtmosphereWest Los Angeles  On August 29 during Sunset on a clear blue sky I was barbqueing in my front yard.  I tilted my head back to relax on my lawn chair and notice a bright object in the sky.  It was much to early for a star to be out and no it was not a satellite.  Satellites that I&apos;ve seen don&apos;t stay in one place they move consistently across the sky. My first thought was it was a balloon, being that there a skyway over my house, a passenger jet flew over.  The object was appeared to be 1000s of feet above the skyway.  Just eyeballing the comparison, it was way to big to be a balloon.  Then I thought a helicopter? Some romantic person enjoying the sunset? Nah, helicopters don&apos;t fly that high. I took out my only camera which had black and white film, took of the auto focus and aimed in the direction of the object.   It was difficult to see through the lens, however very easy to spot with the naked eye.   I used the branches above me to get a bearing where the object might be, as now it was slowly moving and stopping across the sky.  From a SouthWest to a North Direction over Santa Monica. I didn&apos;t know what to do or who to call, strangely I sat back and let the object move out of sight. When I got the pictures developed, they appeared blank!  I could not believe it!  However when my friend scanned them in through photoshop he adjusted the contrast so it was only black and white.  Suddenly right were I remember taking the picture the object appeared!  We zoomed in and noticed it appeared the have a triangular light side, the dark side however we can&apos;t see.  Perhaps there&apos;s a process that can be done with the negatives?  When I was younger a couple of buddies and I entered an X-Files competition and we faked a couple of saucer shots using fishing wire, the good side to that is I can spot a fake UFO shot almost instantly.

We first noticed the first one on the 30th of Aug. as a cloud bank was building in the west, we watched this for about 15 minutes until it was obscured by the cloud bank. The next day of the 31st. one object appeared in the west and as we were watching this another appeared in the northern sky. As we were looking at the one in the west it blinked out then reappeared to the right of it&apos;s origional position. Then to the lower left of this object another object blinked on then off very quickley. I viewed both remaining objects through a pair of binoculars and both were seen as objects that were reflecting light off the right side with a dark outline to the opposite side. It looked like they were reflecting the light and not emitting it as a source. These objects remained in the daylight sky for aprox. 2hrs. time. As we were watching the object in the north began drifting to the west towards the object in the west at a slow pace. As it was nearly to the half way point between it&apos;s origional position and the object in the west the object in the west blinked out. This object came to a position that put in in almost the same place as the first object in the western sky. It remained in this position until almost sunset then began moving to the north west and eventualy turned red and then blinked out. My two friends and other people that were walking back from the beach after the launch were witness to the lights as we pointed them out to them. All of the ones coming fron the beach were talking about the strange show in the sky, but I did not see this because I was involved with the lights. My daughter told me at the time of the launch she was watching a grey cylinder in the sky to the south of the launch.which caught her and her friends attention and also all the other things that others saw with launch. We took some digital film of the object in the western sky but all we could see was mostly a round object at best, but we have this footage. But when viewed throgh the camera the objects were definitly stationary reflective objects.

This appeared to be at a very high altitude. The most notable feature of this object was its ghostlike nature. It appeared similar to a telescopic view of a nebula and had a diameter of about 15 minutes - about half that of the lunar/solar disk. It was very faint but distinct. I was enjoying the crystal clear dark sky on the Labor Day evening. I don&apos;t think I would have noticed it otherwise, but I happened to be looking straight up at the time just as it passed across my line of sight. I followed it until I lost sight of it to the southeast at about 45 degrees elevation. It was not pointlike like a meteor and was not brilliant like a fireball.

It took a few seconds to realize what I was seeing and it blew my mind.  I just stared at it for a few more seconds and then YELLED for my mom to come see it.  It was a I think cigar shaped craft hovering over our lake.  It had about 5 or 6 red and white strobing lights on the side. It hovered there for about 20 seconds and then real slowly started moving left.  I saw it go behind my neighboors house and I ran outside to see if I could still see it but then it was just gone.

In my van, I also had with me my two daughters ages 12 and 14 and my niece, age 13.  We saw numerous airplanes, which were flying to and from Airborne in Wilmington (I know this because I used to work there), but we saw these three brighter lights that stood out.  Two quickly faded out, but there was one left that was the brightest.  I stopped my van on the road to observe this light.  It never moved but it &quot;twinkled&quot; at times, but remained bright.  It was a pretty clear evening out, mabey a few thin clouds.  After observing it while parked, it then faded out and was gone.  We waited for about 10 minutes to see if it would reappear but it did not.   This light did not look like any other star.  This light looked too bright to be a planet.  It was approx. the size of a peanut at arms length.I am guessing it could have been flares, but who knows so we thought we should report it.", "UFO  Stops Traffic on the Ohio Turnpike between Toledo and ClevelandI did not see the object...but it was on the radio station in Cleveland.

I went back in the house for a moment, and my husband yelled for me to hurry outside again.

There were multiple lights in a vertical line following each other, if you looked directly at them it would look like the shape of the big an little hand on a clock lit up like it was 1:25. they came on like a switch, the power was bright enough to cast shadows from the trees and houses in front of the water. It was dusk and i assumed the light source was fire works because of the holiday. But when I looked at them they were motionless, they were not falling down like a firework cascade would normally do. I realized pretty quick that all of the lights were slowly moving together as if they were all connected to the same object. Then the lights when out, they were only illuminated brightly for less than 10-20 seconds. You could still see the light very dimly lit, the object was changing its position in the sky, it was turning from vertical to horizontal. I was silent, it made no noise I can recall. It was clear that it was triangle in shape, its size was around 50 yards roughly. It was hard to say how, but I fell like it was not that thick. It then moved very gradually up into the sky until i could no longer see it. The whole event took around 2-3 minutes, but I will never forget it. I thought it was a government project or something.

Observed at close distances.I was listening to Peter Grabiel&apos;s new video on MTV as I walked out and stood in the cool, crisp, night air of mid-October. The East Texas sky was clear and, as usual, filled with millions of twinkling stars. I could see the Dairy Queen sign that stands beside HWY.8 and was watching the extremely light traffic as it moved east and west along the highway. As I looked further east, just past the huge, blue water tower that stood between me and the highway, I noticed a pair of lights. I assumed it must be a special heavy hauler rig and I waited anxiously for it to pass by the water tower so I could get a better look at it. The lights were above the normal flow of traffic, but I never suspected that they were high enough to be flying and the &quot;truck&quot; was moving very, very slow. As I waited for it to pass the water tower and reappear, I assumed that it must have pulled over...The lights that I had been observing west- bound, at just under a half-mile, was now traveling south-west. As it manuevered around the water tower at about 1800 yards distance, I could clearly see that this was an aircraft. It&apos;s altitude was less than 35 feet and at it&apos;s present speed it would be directly above my head in about 15 minutes. My camera was out of film but I had a M-1 carbine with a 30 round clip full of tracer rounds. I went in the house and got it. A line of pine trees marked the boundry where my backyard joined my neighbor&apos;s yard. 45 yards beyond those trees lies the street that runs in front of his house. The craft was now above the old boat factory, about 300 yards, and as I watched it float, ever so slowly, I saw a bright-white light come on which was located directly in the center of the bottom of the craft. I flipped the safety off of the carbine that I was holding as the UFO approached the street which runs in front of my neighbor&apos;s home. Directly above the street, the rear of the craft came about as it again, changed it&apos;s direction and followed the street west.I am now sixty yards from this craft as it floats through the air so low that the orange reflection from the newly installed amber street lamp was clearly visible on it&apos;s shiny, brushed aluminum appearing skin. NO SOUND! NOT A WHISPER!!NOTHING! It was moving so slow, I had to stop moving to make sure that it was not hovering. My neighbor&apos;s home is a low, ranch styled home about 80 feet long. I observed the craft through the pines that joined our yards as it moved over his home. As it centered his home, about 20 feet of the craft extended beyond each end of his home, giving it a length of 120&apos;.I readied my carbine and aimed at the center of the bright-white light.The bottom of the UFO was flat with a slight hump toward the rear of the craft. It had a light on each of it&apos;s three, rounded corners. These outer lights had the old, yellowish glow, like older vehicles. The top-half of the craft was rounded and egg- shaped and reached a height of at least 15&apos;-20&apos;. I moved across my neighbor&apos;s yard and as I stepped into the street, I observed the craft pass directly over a family&apos;s home, and comparing the two, the UFO was 60&apos; across the rear and was about 15&apos; across it&apos;s nose. I didn&apos;t shoot at the UFO . Those tracer rounds could have bounced off of it, stuck in one of my neighbor&apos;s roofs, and could have burned their house down. I watched the craft as it stayed it&apos;s course and went out of sight.At the time I witnessed this UFO, I was a conveyor mechanic for a government contractor. I&apos;ve worked on air bases all over this nation and there are no aircraft available in our arsenals that can hover 30&apos; off the ground without making a sound.

I saw another car stopped on the side of a parking lot in a place cars should not have been parked because of the hour.  I think they were watching it too.  I found a place to stop and watch.  It moved very slowly, however did appear to speed up after maintaining the same spot for a few minutes.  If flew overhead.  It had a light pattern, however the pattern was not like any I had seen before. I watch the skys at night so I know.  I looked at the craft and it was clearly a black triangle.   As it flew overhead I quick turned off the car to see if I could hear it.  I could hear a low hum, it was differnt from other aircraft I have heard in the past.  This craft was not from the Newark, NYC or Philly airports.  It is possibly from Mcquire airforce base.  I should have paid more attention to the light pattern and copied it down.  It was also a triangle.  It is difficult to judge the size and height.

From my bed I have an excellent view of the eastern sky. I noticed a bright, pulsating, stationary light in the sky at a distance of at least 15 miles. I observed for a minute and woke my wife. While she observed I ran down to find my binoculars (10x25 Nikon). I observed the UFO for a minute and then handed the binoculars to my wife. Without any comment from me she described what I had seen; three equidistant, white lights, apparently attached to some sort of object. After about 3-4 minutes of observing it moved to the east and remained barely in view for another 10 minutes and then become impossible to view. This is the third incident in about two months of an anomolous occurance in the same area. The first was bright, stationary object that I thought was a planet. While observing it dimmed completely out and then came back &quot;on&quot;. Unless I lost my bearings and confused it with a planet it remained there until sunup. Second sighting was of a very bright object at 9:00 in the same area. Again it appeared stationary as I gauged it to the stationary horizon. Honestly, it looked like it could have been an airplane reflecting the sun just right, but then it dimmed out. It very well could have been an airplane but it must have been moving directly away from me as it appeared stationary. The third sighting described at the beginning of this report was very distinct in that we could make out something that did appear to have structure.

My mother, her boyfriend and myself were sitting in the meadow of prospect park. My mom&apos;s boyfriend looked into the sky and pointed out what would have looked like a constellation of stars in a night sky. Six &quot;stars&quot; total, all equidistant from each other in a V-shape. We stared and stared and watched as they remained perfectly equidistant and seemed to float ever higher in the sky for at least 35 minutes. They were much higher than any other aircraft and eventually they disappeared from our field of view. We thought the show was over and we returned to our conversation eagerly trying to discern what we had just saw when to the Northeast two UFO&apos;s appeared this time much lower in the sky. They were visibly silver to the naked eye and appeared oval. Again these two objects remained perfectly equidistant and floated ever higher in the sky until they also disappeared from view. After the two objects were gone from view, my mother &amp; her boyfriend decided to head home to their apartment rooftop to see if they could view anything else. I stayed behind, and about ten minutes after they left a silver object shot across the length of the sky. It moved quickly, seemingly lower than a comercial plane and totally silent unlike a helicopter. It moved west to east across the sky (airplanes over the park all fly south to north). It&apos;s movement seemed much more fluid than an airplane, I orginally thought it looked like a giant silver bird flapping it&apos;s wings. I tried to dismiss the sighting thinking my eyes were just playing tricks on me, when a second object of equal size &amp; color followed along the exact same course! This one, however, changed course about a third of way. It turned sideways and reversed course quickly out of my field of view. When it turned it appeared to have &quot;wings&quot; that were shaped like shark fins but it was hard to tell if these were multi-dementional or flat. After that I finally went home, eager to see if any other sightings had been reported on the news. I saw no other mention of this sighting which I find odd given the amount of people in the park that afternoon and the length of the events. My family and I have never seen anything like this before and my mother&apos;s boyfreind who initially pointed out the objects is a very skepticle person, yet we all agree we saw something that afternoon that cannot be explained by today&apos;s known science &amp; technology.", "I was watching a video when I heard a noise outside.  The windows were open because it&apos;s been very warm here in the Bay Area.  The neighbor&apos;s dog was loose (as usual), but it sounded like someone might have tossed a plastic cup on the street, so I went out with my flashlight.  Seeing the dog loose, I figured things were OK.  As I turned to come back into the house, something in the sky caught my eye to the east.  Being an amateur astronomer, it&apos;s quite common for me to give the sky a glance, even under such circumstances. What I saw amazed me.  Just below the waning Moon yet above the constellation Gemini was a large burnt orange &quot;planet&quot; in the sky.  The reason I say &quot;planet&quot; instead of &quot;star&quot; is because it looked like a larger version of what Mars looks like when it was at its closest approach to Earth last summer (or the summer before, I forget at the moment, I&apos;m nervous).  It was moving like a satellite, but it was too huge to be the space station.  I have seen it before.  It was heading towards the northeast.  The constellation Auriga was high above it.  I watched it for at least a minute.  It was moving so slowly, I decided to go in and grab a pair of binoculars.  The first pair I found was an old trusty 7x35 Tasco (114 m/1000 m-341 ft/1000 yrds).  I rushed back outside, took my glasses off, and zeroed in on it.  What I saw astounded me.  Not only was this object not circular, it had amazing detail to it.  The bottom of it shone with a bright oval glow, just like it was a propulsion of some kind.  It reminded me of the Gulf Breeze photos of that Polaroid UFO.  Above the smaller, oval &quot;bottom&quot; to it was a larger body above it, attached to it.  It looked like three orange beams with at least two dark columns between the glowing parts.  Above the &quot;columns&quot; was a dome of some sort, and it all seems to be one piece moving together. It seemed to be turning, like a tumbling satellite, but I could actually see parts of the craft seeming to twist, giving itself new shapes as it went along.  As it continued, the bottom shone brighter and dimmer, and so did the rest of the &quot;craft.&quot;  It took on a long string-like shape with three prominent oval orange lights, top, middle, and bottom after a while, and when it did that, orange sparks began shooting from the bottom of the &quot;oval&quot; glowing part.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like it.  It made no noise, and I&apos;m led to believe it was a dying satellite of some sort, but I&apos;ve never seen such detail in a satellite, let alone with such a small pair of binoculars.  I watched it for at least three minutes.  I have a digital camera, but it&apos;s hard to even catch the Moon in it, and this object was not as bright in magnitude as the Moon.Venus was rising when I went back out to take a look at the direction it traveled.  It was much larger in size than Venus, although not as bright.  To the unaided eye, the object&apos;s magnitude was pretty much evenly distributed over its area.  Saturn was above and right of Venus, and you could have used 7 Saturns just cover this object with the unaided eye, easily.

At first I thought it was a bright star next to Cassiopeia, but being familiar with astronomy I did not know what star it was, and that is what got my attention. As I started to remove my son from his car seat I looked up again, and still wondered what star I was seeing. I started to talk to my son who was now out of his car seat and moving out of the truck, when it caught my attention again as it started to move. At first it moved slowly for a short distance, but then accelerated rapidly before coming to a complete stop. I then noticed the strobe lights of two aircraft, and the object started to move again in the direction of the aircraft. I was then able to determine it was much lower in altitude than the aircraft, and it had no strobe lights of its own. The object zigged and zagged several times before moving very rapidly and vanishing. Given the fact that it was stationary, then moving in a controlled manner several times over the three to four minutes this lasted, I determined it could not have been a meteor disintegrating. It must have moved away at such a high speed, I could not follow with my eyes.

I saw a shimmering trail of white sparks. I gazed at it for awhile and could just make out a shape of some kind that I percieved to be an elongated shape. It was traveling at about 500-1000 feet. I thought I could make out faint triangular shaped &quot;windows&quot; in a row along the visable side. It was traveling in a North Easterly direction heading towards Millard. The key things that I noted about it was that I could make out a faint engine noise of some kind and that it was traveling very level and straight. It was flying at about the top speed of a single engine Cesna airplane, not very fast but at a good clip. I did gather that it had a rather massive size to it. It was a very big shadow that was darker than the new night sky. What I also noted was this, I could see that it was being escorted by two other aircraft. I could make out their flashing marker lights. One on each side just slightly ahead of the larger object. I figured that whatever it was, it was being escorted by two fighter jets. Of this I have no doubt. The next day, a small story was printed in The Omaha World Herald that some &quot;Space Junk&quot; had fallen and area residents had called in with UFO sightings. It&apos;s interesting that  this term space junk was again used later in another sighting in the same Sector of Nebraska. In the report on your site he was told that his Cigar shaped object was also just Space junk....If I ever go to that region of Nebraska again I&apos;ll make sure to bring my umbrella...it seems that there must be some sort of magnetic field that attracts all of these level flying space junk objects falling from the sky. I&apos;d really like to see how something falling can attain a level trajectory at about 750ft.

We are close to an Cabinis Field Airport and relatively close to NAS Corpus Christi, so we see aircraft all the time.  When she said &quot;airplane&quot; I instinctively looked up.  What I thought we were looking at initially was two birds - seagulls. Then as I watched them I realized they were aircraft as the reflection of light made it obvious that these were metallic.   There were two of them flying in formation.   We have an airshow coming up later this month, so I assumed that they were military jets practicing for the show. I stuck my head in the back door and told my husband what we were watching and he came outside.  As we watched them, we began to think they were birds again, not because of the way they looked but because of the way they were flying. Constantly in formation the two aircraft were manuevering several different patterns including tight circular patterns that we have never seen aircraft perform.  I&apos;m not good with estimating altitude, but these two objects were flying below the few clouds we have in the sky today.  As they turned away from us and toward us, the reflection of the sun hitting the objects made them seem 5 times larger. They were silvery white objects of triangular shape.  There were no sounds as the aircraft went nearly over our heads.   There were no vapor trails or contrails coming off the aircraft either. We sat there watching, not sure of what we were looking at and they just disappeared. Weird.

Looked up and saw in the distance, coloured lights, thought it was a helicopter at first, there is a US base nearby.  Then the object came closer and was clearly a flying saucer.  The object had a band of moving lights around the centre of the craft.  The lights were all different colours they did not merge but moved around.  The craft manoeuvered fast, shot up and down then away then back then hovered sometimes coming almost above us.  It was a spectacular sight.  We were absolutely transfixed to the spot. There was so much movement and changing position.  The speed of the craft was phenomenal. Then the craft went away and we stayed for 30 mins or so and thought it wasn&apos;t going to come back, but then it did and it all started over again.  I don&apos;t really know how long we were there.  There was no sound, the craft was large and moved like nothing I had ever seen before. Finally it went away. A year later in central London I was walking alone to work early one sunday morning, I looked up and there was something I thought at first was a helicopter, the sun was reflecting off a very shiny, but matt, silver coloured object.  Then I realised it was not a helicopter, there were no blades rotating it was just this thing in the sky, completely motionless and again no sound.  I stopped and stared at it.  It had no windows no lights no nothing and it was a cone shape.  Then in shot up and stopped and then came down again and finally just shot straight up into the sky and disappeared. I believe that the second sighting was linked to the first.  I beleive that even though I have no recollection of it, that at the first encounter something happened that has been wiped from my memory.

I stood looking for a few minutes but saw nothing more.  About 10 min. later I came back outside with binoculars because I saw planes high enough not to hear and I wanted to watch if they were circling the area.  As I moved out of view of the plane I saw two circular lights moving through or behind a small cloud.The lights were smaller than the oval, round and moving seperately, kind of zig zagging and very fast.

We had just finished our block party.While we were chatting, I noticed 3 red lights in the sky just to the north of us. We were facing West, but I saw them out of the corner of my eye. So I faced North to get a better look. I watched them for a good 45 minutes.  One light was at 12 o&apos;clock, one at 6 o&apos;clock and one at about 7 .The objects were at a 45 degree angle from where I was standing.  It seemed to be about 5 or 6 miles away.

It was between mile marker 26 and 24. I saw a ball of bright white light  plummeting at approximately a 45 degree angle, very fast. The ball was not perfectly defined--it appeared  to have motion, whirling, with bright light coming out of it. There was a white tail. The ball of light was about  three-quarters to a full size of what would be considered an ordinary full moon.  In the instant before the ball disappeared from sight, about a third of the length of the tail (the portion of the tail closest to the ball) displayed colors as in a spectrum, in distinct, separate bands of distinct colors, being of fairly wide breadth. The bands of color were perpendicular to the tail, not lengthwise. And the rest of the tail remained white.

She described a bright light with lights shooting off of it and circling around and then rejoining the main light.  Several of us that were there went outside to investigate.  We walked the half block down the gravel road to the Farm to Market road to get a better view.  Just coming into view was an object flying very low and slow.  It was coming out of the East and moving directly West following the FM road.  I would estimate it&apos;s height to have been around 600 ft and it&apos;s width to be about 75 yards wide.  It was triangular in shape and had several lights down each &quot;wing&quot;.  The lights were different colors but of the same configuration on each wing.  I remember 4 lights on each wing of blue, orange, and white colors.  Where the tail of a normal aircraft would have been were three lights arranged in an L shape but we could clearly see the straight line across the back extending to the tips of the wings forming the triangle shape.  In the center of the object was a red check mark.  It was similar to an arrow pointing in the direction of travel, dead center on the bottom, but was missing one of the lines that would have formed a complete arrow, instead resembling an upside down check mark.  The craft made absolutely no sound as it travled and continued moving very slowly until it passed out of our field of view.  We observed the craft for about 20 minutes. I called my grandfather who was a dispatcher at the local Sheriffs office to see if he had heard any reports and he had not.  He went up on the county courthouse roof where he worked but did not observe anything.  He was about 3 miles to the southwest of our location.  I also contacted the small municiple airport in Commerce, TX which is about 25 miles to the SW of our location to see if they knew of any military operations in the area.  Their response was that if they did they couldn&apos;t tell us. Very shortly after the event, the neighbor who had alerted us to the object and had described something very different from what we observed was suddenly stricken with Pancreatic cancer and passed away very suddenly.  She seemed to be of perfect health and went into the hospital for stomache pains,  a few days later she passed away. I have been watching the sky ever since and have never seen anything like it again.  I&apos;m an avid aircraft and military &quot;buff&quot;.  The B2 bomber was unveiled around this time and I just chalked the sighting up as a lucky view of some secret test flight.  Of all the pictures I have seen of the B2 since, I have never seen any with anything like the light configuration I described above.

I watched them for a minute or so until they suddenly shot off to the north at an unbelievable speed.  Then while I was watching to see if they would return I became aware of a very low frequency hum or perhaps it was more like an electrical hum  and I actually felt it more than I heard it.

It could have been glowing the whole time, but in the daylight it looked metallic. In the telescope, you could see the round shape, which rules out a bright star. All I saw was a white sphere; no details. OK, at this point, I was thinking, is this a real UFO?

I will give you his email address also but for some reason he hasn&apos;t reported this as of yet.  I&apos;m urging him to and I&apos;m sure he will, but for now here is the info I have. He lives in view of the Bremerton ship yard approx. a mile north from the water.  He told me tonight that this was the 3rd time he&apos;s seen this in the last couple months.  What was described to me was two balls of light, one bigger than the other, both hovering over the water and changing colors rapidly from blue to red to green to white then staying white and pulsating, then going back to rapidly changing colors.  One would move slowly to the left and then come back.  The other stayed there, hovering and moving to the left then right then holding position. The bigger one finally moved off to the left then vanished instantly, the smaller one stayed there until finally moving off and getting smaller, then gone.  I was on the phone with him while he was describing this to me. What I wrote down was this: approx. 8:40 pm to 8:48 pm on Tues. night Sept. 21st, 2004.  One big, one small, both pulsating and changing colors from blue to red to green to white, one moving off to left etc. I&apos;m repeating myself so I&apos;ll wrap it up there.  The first time he called me after seeing these same objects was a couple months ago and I can get the details of that sighting also.  Both previous sightings he ran into the house to get his binoculars or monocular and when he returned to the deck they were gone. Tonight he had the mono with him and watched the whole time through that. I could tell he was quite impressed with what he was seeing and kept saying &quot;god, what is that, I don&apos;t know but it&apos;s not helicopters or military planes, I&apos;ll tell you that much.&quot;  Then they were gone and our conversation basically ended a minute or so after that, I told him I would send a link to your website and also report the incident myself. He agreed. So, since I have actually sent a picture of something in to you before, I decided to report this first, and then let you pursue an email conversation with him if you wish. His name is ((name deleted))and just for the record does not drink alcohol or take any drugs etc. Sober guy and not likely to be making this kind of thing up. I&apos;ve personally known ((name deleted)) for 20 years and will vouch for that. My name is ((name #2 deleted)), I live here in West Seattle. Anyway, his email address is; ((deleted)). Thanks so much and hope you find this of some use.  My next mission is to buy him a pair of those binoculars that take digital pics so maybe he can get it on film next time:-) Regards, ((name deleted))", "My father was an over the road truck driver. I was just a young boy. When he returned from his week long run he told my mom he had seen 2 huge u.f.o.s.out west. He said he was driving along and all of a sudden the road lit up as if a plane was going to land. You see, back home. we lived close to an airport and this was commen  whenever a plane would come in to land. That was his first thought, then realizing he&apos;s out in the middle of nowere he started slowing down and looking out the window. He saw 2 huge cigar shaped crafts, floating slowly towards the east. No noise with steam or somthing coming out of the rear of the craft. He watched for a while untill he saw them split up, one kept heading east, and one went south. My mom did not beleive him and asked why do you see these things and nobody else does. This got dad mad and he went right to bed. That morning mom couldent wait for dad to get up after seeing the paper. There it was, In black and white, 2 huge u.f.o&apos;s spoted, One over lake michigan and one down south somwhere I dont remember. Well after seeing that mom never doubted dad again. Dad had seen them when they split up. Check it out in the milwaukee sentinal, thats what it was called back then. I am not sure on the date. Could be early to mid 60&apos;s mabe even late 50&apos;s I was very young, dad is pasted away and mom in her 80&apos;s can&apos;t remember the year anymore.

The object was very still in the air for approximately 2 minutes as we watched in awe.It made no sound at all.   Suddenly from out of no where, another disk shaped object appeared and hovered next to the first one. This UFO identical to the first one.   The first one, as if waiting for this second one, tilted slightly and off it went into the yonder with the other one following.

All I can say is that I am not a person who makes things up. I think I am a very careful observer and I can only tell you what I saw. On Sunday, Sept. 12 I went out on my porch to look at the sky. It was about 8:00 P.M.. My 2nd floor apartment faces Southeast. I looked to my right (Southwest) and saw a bright, large, white light approaching at low altitude. This looked very similar to the object I reported on the 7th. Only this time the object appeared much lower in the sky. I have no way of knowing for sure, but I would estimate the object was only 1000 feet up or so. This time I did not hesitate. I ran inside and grabbed my pair of 7 X 35 binoculors. As I came back out the object was just beginning to pass over my head. It was moving in a straight Southwest to Northwest direction. I estimate the speed at somewhere between 100-150 MPH. Looking at the object did not change much. It still appeared to be a solid ball of white light. I tried to stabilize the binoculars on one of the porch columns to get a steady view. At one time I thought I might have seen a small dark (almost black) triangle leading this light, but I am not completely sure of this. It made absolutely no sound whatsover. It passed by me and continued it&apos;s steady course. As it got to the Northeast it took on a reddish hue. I thought this might be from haze. It then dimmed and seemed to blink out. I couldn&apos;t help but think it was turning off it&apos;s lights as it would be approaching Bradley Airport just north of Hartford. I looked carefully, at no time were there any other lights other than the one solid white light. This object appeared the same from every perspective. It was a ball of light. About one minute later a small private plane flew by travelling at about the same altitude and direction. However this small plane was a greater distance away from me.I could hear the small plane clearly and also see directional lights as well. The small plane was travelling about the same speed as the object. I watched the small plane as it flew off in the Northeast. It never dimmed and I could see it&apos;s lights until it flew over the treeline in the distance. So much for the haze. Maybe 5 minutes later I saw a bright white light coming from the Northeast. I thought the object might be returning. But looking with binoculars I could see 2 small white lights in the center, and the red and green directional lights on the wings. This was an airliner which I see many of every night. One thing occured to me. As this airliner flew by I could no longer see the white lights on the front. I could also hear it clearly and it was at a much higher altitude than the object I observed.", "A white, beluga whale shaped object about a third the size of a small plane flew from horizon to horizon in 3 mintutes.It was a beluga-whale shaped, white, ship that flew from northeast to southwest over Softball Field 6 at Memorial Field in Simsbury. There was woods around the field, and behind the woods was a school. It was a clear day with no clouds and flew from horizon to horizon in about 3 mintutes. It flew faster than a cloud but slower than a plane. There was a small breeze, but not enough to propel it. It was about a third the size of a small, three-person plane.

It looked a little like a meteor entering the atmoshere.  The &quot;contrail&quot; was a elongated tear-drop shape.  Yellow/white in color and less than 1/2&quot; long if the length was messured at arm&apos;s length.  The &quot;contrail&quot; pulsed on and off in a very periodic fashion.  Three pulses with a pause and then three more pulses.  It completed about 4/5 cycles of 3 pulses in the time it took to disappear over the horizon.  The direction of travel was South to North. Note: we saw a shooting star and several satilites over 2 nights of star gazing.  This object did not resemble any of these sightings.

I then looked where Venus was supposed to be, and lo, there it was! So I look back and it starts darting around as if the driver is getting a feel for the controls.

On return from school, I looked for the object but it was gone. Although my entire family was in the kitchen during the my initial observation, for some reason I did not mention it to anyone.

I went to visit my dad in the Hurst-Euless-Bedford area for dinner on Labor day.We went outside and we were just talking in the backyard. I was sitting on the concrete and looking up into the sky, around sunset. Suddenly I saw what appeared to be a star at first, shimmering and white, only it was still daylight. I thought that maybe it was just the first visible star in the sky at night, so i looked around to see if other stars were visible. There were none. As in the other post from euless, I too was directly under the DFW International Airport flight line. There were many planes flying in from the South, going North. I shrugged off the light/sphere as a star, and continued talking to my dad, when I happened to glance up again. The sun was shining through the clouds and casting an orange/red tint on everything, including the planes in the sky. That was when I noticed that this object glimmered just like the planes, as if the sun was casting a reflection onto it as well. At this point I called my dad over to take a look, and just as he was walking over to do so, it blinked off like a light bulb. It simply vanished. I have no idea what it was, but for a couple of days, I thought about it, found my way here, and saw the other Euless post. I would guess that the object was at least 5000 ft in the air. It seemed to be higher than the flight path of the planes, though I am certain that they would have seen this too. It was white, but not extremely bright, just bright enough to catch your eye. It would be impossible to guess the size, other than to say it appeared small in the sky compared to the planes. This entire event lasted about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, but in the last glimpse of the object, when the sun hit it, I could see definite shadow, and shape, which is why I started doubting it was a star at all.

But, what was strange is there were no other stars/planets around because it was still light out.  So, I was just watching the bright star shaped object.  Thinking that maybe it was some sort of reflection from a high flying plane.  But, it wasn&apos;t changing direction or flickering.  As I stared at it trying to get my roomate to look at it.  I noticed that it seemed to be going into the atmosphere.  It was getting dimmer and dimmer.  Until it disappeared.  But, it wasn&apos;t like the &quot;light source&quot; was dimming.  It was like it was being enveloped by the atmosphere.", "It was a v shape with what looked like white lights every couple of Feet.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I was awakened about 3:00 or 3:30 a.m. by a dog barking way off in the distance and a VERY strange sound that kept getting louder as it approched and flew directly overhead and then beyond and out of hearing range. Of course it&apos;s extremely difficult to describe sound but I&apos;ll try... It sounded like bubbles popping or like you stuck a straw into a bowl of water and blew accompanied by an electronic high pitch sound that would rise and fall about four times per second. No whirring of blades, no engine sound either, jet or piston, whatsoever. Scared me to death!  I&apos;ve never heard anything like this in my life. I&apos;m sorry, but I didn&apos;t see this thing because I was tucked into my sleeping bag and I had tarps draped and tied overhead to cut out the wind. I thought about trying to get a look at it, but by the time I got my wits enough to think about this it was very close and I guess I was just too scared or something and, man, the sound was just reverberating through the woods and it was just too weird. I&apos;m really sorry now that I didn&apos;t try to see it but I just laid there wide-eyed and I bet you would have done the same (and I had a loaded Marlin 35).((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Looking around the skies from my backyard I watch for any falling stars and sattilites, like I do often, having to smoke(cigarettes)outside. The view from my backyard I see a large portion the northern night sky. Last night I did see a single sattalite or star fall, I was excited to see this and scanned quickly for any more falling objects. From the south east behind me I saw a cluster of round lights in a V formation, on a straight fast direction going north. It took at least 3.5 seconds to clear from one point in the sky to its dissapearing point in the north behind the tree-line of my nieghbours. The round lights were in perfect formation of a V, and I am positive that there were separate in flight. I could see stars in the background and in between the lit round objects. The brightness of each of these circular objects was about the denisity of common porchlights in the distance, though I am certain what I saw was not sattalites or falling stars.", "anyone else see possible ufo in chicago area on saturday 10-09-04skies were blue and the color appeared to be white or silver with the reflection of the sun. it was round with a split in the middle. it was very high in the sky and had no vapor trail. it wobbled back and forth as it went thru the sky and at the end when it went out of sight it veered left and then turned right. not sure what it was and was wondering if anyone else saw it.", "Linked parabolic shapes with blinking lightOn Tuesday August 31 from approximately 9pm eastern time to 9:15pm my wife and I observed from our front porch in central-upstate New York (approximately 42N, 76W) a flying object EXACTLY identical in appearance to the one in the second sketch on your web site (the sketch that&apos;s accessible by clicking on the &quot;Click here for a more detailed graphic&quot; link off of today&apos;s FLASH report on your home page). It was a perfectly clear, entirely cloudless and starry night, more than one hour past sunset and just a quarter-hour after moonrise. I first noticed the object relatively low and distant in the sky as I looked to the west-southwest. It appeared well above the treeline as a white, somewhat fuzzy, oval-shaped splotch in the sky, about the size of an aspirin at arm&apos;s length. After staring at it for a full minute, it also seemed to be moving extremely slowly toward me. As a lifelong stargazer and skywatcher, it caught my attention due to its relatively large size, its relative brightness in the night sky, and the fact that, for me, if didn&apos;t fit any category of previously observed aerial phenomena. I yelled to my wife and grabbed two optics -- an 8x20 monocular and 16x50 binoculars. By this time we were certain that the object was slowly moving toward us. As I viewed it for at least 15 minutes through the 16x binoculars, it never changed its shape from the one shown in the sketch I previously referenced -- its appearance was that of two large, equal-sized parabolic shapes that were back to back but slightly separated and linked through their middles by a somewhat cigar-shaped element that was slightly pointier at the left (south-facing) end. These shapes appeared to be gaseous, almost cloudlike in nature, but they were sufficiently defined and unchanging. As I looked through the 16x binoculars, I also saw an occasionally-blinking white light at the left tip of the cigar-shaped central element. It blinked at an  irregular rate, and my wife could not see this aspect of it through the 8x monocular. At one point midway through our roughly 15-minute observation period, I also saw (through the binoculars) a yellow-red dot that moved quickly toward the south; it originated from the same tip where the white light was periodically blinking. I could only track the low-intensity yellow-red light briefly through the binoculars&apos; field of view before it vanished; I could not see this light with my naked eye. The dual-parabolic-shaped object&apos;s line of travel took it directly over my house at a high altitude. As it slowly approached the point directly overhead, the object also had begun to lose its shape, size, and intensity of luminosity. When it was directly overhead, the object ceased to exist, although I continued to observe this overhead location for another 30 minutes and could still (but barely) make out a faint amorphous form in its place. At this point, and all throughout the observing period, there were still no clouds in the sky, and we heard no sounds from the object. There were occasional commercial aircraft traversing the sky at various altitudes, but none had any interaction or effect on this object, which was at an unknown but seemingly high altitude. I did not see any reports in this morning&apos;s (Wednesday) local daily newspaper. I don&apos;t know if it was mentioned on any local radio or TV stations. I am a marketing / public relations profesional and my wife is a finance professional. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Cape Canaveral.  PD))", "Glowing UFO seen in Columbus that began traveling backwards nearly instantlyI cannot confirm exactly what it is that I saw. It was flat however, with no limbs of any sort such as wings found on an airplane. I could slightly tell the shape was reminiscent of a disk or saucer. It began its journey in the near proximity of the moon. As it neared larger cloud formations I could at times see that it was going behind them. The only clouds present in the sky were the high cirrus clouds, yet like I said earlier, I could roughly discern a shape. As it came from behind a cloud, it had lost its glow and now its shape was much more clearly prominent. It was then a dull metallic hue. Moments later it vanished from sight. Its descent across 1/4 of the sky had taken no more than two minutes. Keep in mind that this was not traveling away from me. It kept its size and girth throughout and seemed to be traveling in an arc or semicircle around my location. I frantically searched the dusk sky for the object but I could no longer see it. Resigned to thinking I had hallucinated, I walked away defeated all the while fighting the urge to run into a nearby restaurant and shout &quot;Did you see the UFO?!&quot;  A quick glance caught me off guard as I realized that the object was back in the sky and glowing- only now it was suddenly traveling the opposite direction. Correct me if I speak wrongly, but can a plane suddenly begin traveling the exact opposite direction in mid flight?  Either I&apos;m on a rollercoaster and this is loony land or I really did see a UFO tonight.", "Cluster of lights w/ large trail of debrisI noticed a slow-moving cluster of lights in the sky that dissipated shortly after I noticed it.  At first, it had the appearance of a satellite burning upon re-entry to earth, except all the lights were white rather than many colors(as would normally be expected from a shooting star or burning satellite).  Also, the lights were moving too slow to be meteorite(less than mach 3 for sure).  As it was moving, I noticed a trail of smaller lights launching from the cluster, but in the opposite direction.  The trail behaved like debris being left behind a fast-moving vehicle, except it was moving faster than the larger cluster of lights.  Keep in mind that during this time the cluster was still visible and all this happened within a second.  Normally, I would dismiss this as a meteorite or satellite anyway, but this is the third sighting I&apos;ve had of this type of object since June 2004.((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness implies an evening sighting.

It was covered with lights and just hovered there.", "Would it be possible they were stars?My boyfriend was laying in our hammock when he pointed up in the sky and said what do you think those are. I said wait let me grab my glasses, and I came back outside to confirm with him 4-5 silver (we thought planes at first) objects in t he sky. It was crystal clear out and the sun was reflecting off of the objects so it was very easy to see them, but at the same time if you took your eyes off of the objects it took a few seconds to find them again. I really don&apos;t want to say it couldn&apos;t have been planes, although there were too many in the same area and they weren&apos;t b-lining like a plane would, they were just moving a little this way and a little that way. I would say they were 30,000-40,000 feet in the air, but it was so clear out that it was possible to see with the naked eye, in my case with glasses.", "Comet shaped or rectangle shaped slow moving object.A co-worker and I watched a bright rectangle in the sky.  It kinda reminded me of a comet because it was not moving to the naked eye.  It was Very bright because we were in a well lit area and could still see it.  We kept coming back outside to see it. It slowly and eventually moved off into the northern horizon till we could not see it anymore.  This movement was gradual.  Nothing that you would notice just by watching it.  We kept coming back and each time it was moving farther away, from south to north.", "6 flashing lights south of lincolnton in a perfect horizontal line before disappearingOn Thursday night, Sept. 9, 2004 I was sitting outside on my porch when a light in the sky caught my eye. When I looked up there were two flashes of light, almost like small balls of fire. Then immediately after I followed a horizontal line of lights. Each one perfectly horizontal with the one before and as soon as one light would go out there would be another light up. I&apos;ve seen planes before and I&apos;m sure this wasn&apos;t one. After 6 lights, they disappeared. The sighting was towards the south.", "Star-like light in the Eastern sky that came &amp; went - Santa Rosa, CaliforniaMy dog work me up at about 5:30 am, and I was looking out the window trying to get back to sleep.  A light, that looked like a very bright star zipped up where I could see it above a neighbors rooftop, however it looked as though it was pretty far away, like an airplane.  It went slowly higher in the Eastern sky for about 10-15 minutes, and I woke up my daughter to see it.  It slowly went east bound and disappeared out of view.  I figred it must have been a sattelight, or something like that, but then it came back!  It hung around for a while, but then I fell back asleep after watching it for about 15 minutes.  I have no idea what it could have been.", "Zig Zagging Light in the night sky.I was up north with some friends and as we were sitting around outside the cottage, I was staring up into the sky marvelling at the beauty of the stars. I live in Toronto so when I do manage to get away from the light pollution I try to take it all in. What I saw was this; a light that closely resembled that of a bright star zig zag from one end of the horizon to the next. The light was moving at too fast a speed to be a satellite, and the zigs and zags must have cleared miles of sky judging from how far up the light appeared to be. I followed the light for as long as I could before losing it over the horizon.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I immediately looked up and what I saw was a brilliantly lit, sphere shaped, bright orange object, silently slipping thru the atmosphere at a fairly high rate of speed from a north to south direction. The object appeared to be close to the ground opposed to being up in space. Possibly the altitude of a low flying airplane just above the clouds.The size could be compared to a street lamp at about 100 yards away. I thought it could possibly be the space station but the object seemed so close and too large to be the space station in my opinion. I work at the airport around helicopters and fixed wing aircraft and I can positively rule them all out without a doubt. The 90 degree angle that I saw the object (directly below) with nothing behind it,no sound and the high rate of speed.

As I was walking down this darkened street, I saw the odd shaped ship I&apos;ll enclose a drawing of.

I have a history of weird things happening in my life anyway, so this isn&apos;t all that unexpected I guess.  I drew what I could remember, though it was foggy...so may not be perfect.

It was making unbelievable circular maneurversWe were traveling northbound on Interstate 79 north of Pittsburgh on Sept.6,(Labor Day) 2004.  Traffic was heavy.  As we crested the hill past the Evan City entrance to I 79 we spotted a Y shaped white/silver craft above the treeline west of the highway.  At first we thought it was some sort of remote controlled airplane because it was making unbelievable circular maneurvers above and within the treeline.  However, it seemed too large (over an inch in size) to be a radio controlled toy airplane. Also, the Y shape was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. The air show lasted for less than 20 seconds. We lost sight of the craft for approximately 15 seconds as we were traveling about 70 mph. After we began to descend down into the valley towards the Zelienople exit, we saw what we believed was the same craft traveling in a straight pattern at a high rate of speed east by north east toward the Evan City - Butler area.  The craft was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon. At this height, the craft was about 1/2 inch in length. My boyfriend was surprised at the speed and size of this craft. After we got home I had everyone (my son age 13, my boyfriend and myself) draw a picture of what they saw.  We compared pictures.  Each was Y -shaped - simliliar to a Mercedes Logo. If this was an experimental plane (remote controlled or otherwise)and not a UFO, it was certainly beautiful to look at and remarkable to watch.  It would have been very dificult to make circular patterns above and into this heavily forested and hilly terrain next to the highway. The sky was blue with some clouds, and the Y shaped craft really stood out. It should have been visible to many people on the highway. I would be very curious to know if anyone else traveling on the highway at that time of day happened to catch the airshow.((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness send a graphic illustration of what the object looked like, and will compare it with known aircraft.

We pulled over and had parked in a popular parking spot in a small town called stanley  which is placed right on the ohio river.  We had been parked maybe 5 minutes  and i was resting my head back on the headrest  watching the night sky over the ohio river looking in  the direction of north-west..of this I am positive.  I saw a glowing round light  that seemed to dim and bright in a repeating pattern. The color of this light was whiteish to light bluish in color.  I thought i t was a plane at first  but soon realized  by its movements  that it couldn&apos;t be.  Then i said to myself  it is a helicopter... but soon realized  that the distance it was covering  in what seemed like a millioneth of sec  that it wasnt.  I told my friend to look  and he saw it too.  I don&apos;t know how to describe it... but this object seemed to be reading my mind  moving in directions that i was telling it to go.  It took 10 minutes for me to KNOW  it wasn&apos;t anything manmade  it moved to quickly and efficiently... i had treetops on the opposite side of the river to base distance on  it was not quite as far away as the stars  but not as low as conventional aircraft fly, but way above the treetops. We watched for another 20  minutes or so, before i got scared and asked to be taken home, I also had him close the top on the convertible.   Once home in thruston southeast of where i first spotted the object, I looked in the sky and saw it again but more to the southeast of me  and over a rural area  not the river anymore...  it was still pretty far away...  I was spooked  told my friend bye and went in the house.   I went to a psychiatrist over this  who dismissed it and tried to put me on medicine for it... i found this funny....and maddening.   But 9 years later in late january of 2002 I saw the same object again. I was married at the second sighting it was like 4 am in the morning  and my husband was leaving for work.we live in a small community less than a 1/4 of a mile away from the ohio river  and it seemed to be in the location  that i saw it in 9 yrs. previously.  I was very scared  locked the house down made sure all blinds were closed.  I don&apos;t know how describe the feeling of it being able to sense my thoughts.  I told a fieman friend of mine about it several hours later  and he said not to feel strange others have seen these things.  Incedentally i called the airport after the first sighting in 1993 the next morning  but they had no reports of anything strange.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
