["Unknown object spotted while reviewing photo of clouds/shower line taken earlier in day.I was outside shooting a line of showers just to the south of me and moving west to see how much detail showed up. I&apos;m always testing the limits of my camera. I took a few shots of this same area and saw nothing but clouds and showers during the shoot.It wasn&apos;t until I transferred the photos to the computer and looked at them that I saw a thin dark line in one shot. I cropped the image to 100% and cleaned up the image noise almost entirely but couldn&apos;t identify the object. I posted the photo and crops of the photo to the astronomy forum I&apos;m registered with online (Cloudynights.com)but no one there has identified it yet. I figured someone would recognize it as a plane or something but it still remains un-named. I am approx 12 miles NW of FLL airport and planes on final approach usually fly west right over my house or a few miles to the south prior to circling south and finally east towards the airport. I see what might be a hint of front landing gear to the lower right of the object but it could be remaining image noise. It&apos;s possible that this is a plane heading west prior to circling south for final. It&apos;s odd that theres no hint of a tail but it could be hidden by the clouds. The entire bottom of the object is dark but it could be a plane painted dark blue on the bottom and viewed directly from the side. I do take photos of passing jets sometimes and there are a few with dark painted bottoms. Either way...I can&apos;t identify it for certain or get any more detail from the image. In all probability it is a plane. I&apos;m sure your organization has access to flight plans and approximate location of planes at certain times...and the exact time of the photo is embedded in my EXIF data. Image was taken with a SONY DSC-H1 at 5mp (also in EXIF DATA).Please advise whatever you find out.Thanks for you time.((name deleted)((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

The light was moving slowly and appeared to be an airplane, but what caught my attention was the way it was changing in intensity, not blinking like the normal airplane light does.  As it came nearer, it suddenly shot out to the rear what appeared to be a flare (it reminded me of a fighter jet spitting out chalf to defend against a heat seaking missile).  It did that three times as it approached, and then when it got directly over my house, the light split in two with the appearance of flares, and then was gone. I realize that this could have possibly been a meteor, but it appeared to be moving to low and slow for a meteor, and the flares coming off traveled in the opposite direction and then dropped down before flaming out.  If it was a meteor, wouldn&apos;t all the pieces from the fragmentation keep traveling in the same direction as the main body?", "Luz anaranjada brillante,que se mueve horizontalmente y luego verticalmente para convertirse en estrella.Estaba en mi barco con dos amigos,en una cala de la isla de Ibiza;eran las 2:30 a.m.De repente,detras de la montagna se elevo una luz en forma de esfera anaranjada muy brillante (tamagno de pelota de pin-pon o un poco mayor); permanecio quieta unos 2 minutos,y nos dio tiempo a mirar con los prismaticos:los tres vimos la misma esfera aunque con los prismaticos se veian tambien 3 o 4 esferitas mas pequegnas en la parte inferior de la esfera grande y del mismo color.Despues de este tiempo,se movio horizontalmente y mas o menos despacio;se volvio a quedar quieta como 30 segundos.Despues se elevo verticalmente,de forma bastante rapida hasta disminuir su tamagno a la mitad,donde permanecio unos 10 o 15 segundos.

I believe they went higher into the sky so they were no longer visible.  Each of the objects looked the same.  They were about twice the size of a star and appeared to have lights.

My husband was teasing me, saying &quot;Hey, remember that time you thought you saw aliens?&quot; and as I was defending what I had seen months earlier, and  he said &quot;Holy shit, look at that!&quot; I looked up and there was a disk, that was illuminated very slightly green, though there were no lights visible. It took about 15 seconds to pass over us and disappear out of our sight. A few minutes later, there was a second disk, exactly like the first. About half an hour later, another formation flew over head. It looked almost like a small grouping, flying in a formation. There were maybe 6 or so, flying closely together in a wavy line. Less than a minute later, there was another small grouping, this time flying in the shape of a triangle. These last two were dark in color, not illuminated at all. We could only see them because they were darker than the sky. The last one came at about 11:15pm, it was another disk like the first two. All 5 of the UFOs that we saw came from the same direction (S, SW), and headed the exact same direction (N, NE). It was a clear night, and it seems like just before or just after they flew overhead, the sky flashed with lightening, though there were no lightening bolts. All of the &apos;lightening&apos; was coming from about the same direction as the UFOs were heading. This experience is one of the most incredible. Even my husband, who is a skeptic of all things supernatural couldn&apos;t believe it. This is the first experience of its kind for both of us.

Me and my friend watched a wedding dance party that night and were walking in a dusty road about 1/2 kilometer from our house and when we reached the perimeter of the elementary school I heared a high frequency noise like the hissing sound of a blank cassette tape and I thought it was the stereo player they used to play music in the wedding party but it was already far from where we were. My friend looked back at me and asked me if I heared the noise. We looked around but there was nothing but darkness all around because there were no lighting posts in that place. Then I heared a very low frequency sound but not loud. I stopped walking and I looked around once again but saw nothing. We were already in front of the metal gate of the school when suddenly I looked upwards on my left side as the sounds came from and there, I saw a very big object which was moving or flying very slow and very low. The object was round in front and pointed at the rear (as it moved forward on its round part). It was not revolving and it moved in a straight path. I saw that there were lights, some bright red and some were like phosphorescent lights like the ones emmitted by the numbers of a watch. The lights were like those of a valve in a valvestate amplifier and they were not blinking. We stopped and sat on the dust trying to hide in the hollow-block wall while watching the object moved slowly towards the western part. Then when it was on top of us I saw the rear lower portion openned and two smaller flying objects came out of the openning and the 2 objects flew very fast towards the eastern part and the two flying objects emmitted a light blue color. When the two smaller objects returned they were flying very low and theyu were almost touching the leaves of the sugar canes and they stopped afloat in the middle of the plantation right in front of the school. It was very clear to see the objects even it was very dark. They measure more or less like four passenger buses placed side by side and thay did not make any sound. One of the objects protruded something like a mechanical arm and it reached for the dusty dry soil and seemed to bury itself in the ground. We hurriedly jumped to the other side of the wall and peeped through the holes of the designed cement blocks of the wall. I saw the mechanical arm uprooted some sugar canes and brought it inside an openning. Then the two objects flew towards the big thing and entered into the openning. The big object moved in a vertical path higher then it stopped afloat. The lights went out and it did not move while remaining afloat in the air. The form and details of the big object became clearer as it moved upwards. Then it started moving sideways towards the north still in a very slow phase by that time it was soundless. The light turned on and grew bighter and brighter until it was very painful for my eyes to look straight into the object then suddenly it flew in an unbelievable speed toward the west and disappeared. The following day me and my friend went back to the sugar cane plantation to see the place where some were uprooted but in our surprise there were no holes or diggings in the site.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was about 20 ft. off of my left wing.  It was about 3 feet in diameter, tan in color, and looked like a weather balloon except that it had no inflation nozzle, no radiosonde attached to it, and it was perfectly round.  Weather balloons have a teardrop shape to them when strapped to a weather gathering payload. I circled back to get a closer look and noticed what appeared to be a red crecent moon or a hammer and scycle shape on it reminiscent of the emblem on the former Soviet flag. As I circled around a second time to get closer look, the object moved away from me and maintained a distance of about 50 to 75 yard spacing between itself and my plane. When I became aware that the object could manuver, I was certainly rattled.  I tried to pursue the object about a minute or two but it accellerated away to the point that I could not keep up with it.  I was traveling at 120 knotts.  Scared, I opted to return to the Gadsden Airport.  When I arrived home, I reported the sighting to the Anniston Flight Service Station.  I believe the attendant at the FSS was unofficially impressed, but I don&apos;t know weather or not he officially filed my report. I believe the UFO to be either alien, a Top Secret USA probe, or the Russians aren&apos;t telling us something.  I maintain that what I saw was not a weather balloon and flew under its own power.  I strongly believe the markings were used camoflage the UFO to be from Earth.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was like really intense heat lightning. And then I saw something else in the sky, a small, black circle. It grew fast into a large, black hole and even blotted out the stars. This was near the vicinity of the Big Dipper looking strait up and towards the north.And then a craft came through the middle of the hole that was lighter black - kind of dark grey , and it appeared as it emerged from the hole and slowed it&apos;s speed after the whole thing came through. The craft was shaped like a sphere or a disk.Then the black hole shrunk the same way it emerged and the craft disappeared  and then everything disappeared, nothing was left but strobing sky.My husband witnessed the strobing sky but not the &quot;gateway&quot; or the craft because that part only lasted at most a few seconds although the strobing lights in the sky lasted maybe 10 minutes, and my husband was looking at another part of the sky.

At there lowest point they were maybe 1 km from the ground. The sighting only lasted about 10 seconds. As they got closer to the ground, they got much bigger.

Then I noticed two more identical flashing lights behind and off to the sides in a triangular shape. Now the first light was visible out the windshield of the vehicle.  I said something to my friend (the driver), and he craned his neck to look at the light.  As he noticed the strange light, it banked left across our path heading West.

The objects (or object) was directly in front of us around a mile away and approximately 15,000 to 20,000 vertical feet.  As the lights moved to the West it stayed in perfect formation and appeared to be one huge object.  But I could not confirm this.  If this were one object, the shear size of it is mindblowing.  The lights slowly disappeared to our West obscured by Mt. McGee and the Eastern Sierra&apos;s.  The whole incident lasted around a minute and a half.

I saw these while at a friends bbq and there were about six of us who witnessed it.  We even tried to video tape it but it didn&apos;t work out.  It was in the middle of the night I think it was of January of 2004 I was on winter break from college.  It was probably around 8 PM and we saw a flashing red object which was very bright in the sky.  At first we all thought it was a star but it was way to large and close to us to be one.  I thought it was a missle because it appeared to be moving and thought it was coming towards us.  We were all really skeptical until the object started moving in another direction.  People were saying it was an airplane but no airplane moves that quickly and can move in a variety of different directions at that speed.  The object moved up and down and left and right.  An airplane could not do that.  The red object also hovered in the sky for a while then elevated it self higher into the sky.  Definitely not an airplane.  As the object flew higher it came closer to the moon and pretty much covered it in the night sky.  It was at this point that maybe six or more smaller triangular aircrafts flew out of it.  The small aircrafts flew right beneath and scattered all over the sky and it had to be a scatter of 10 miles in diameter.  These small triangle aircrafts also flashed  red lights and flew all over the place way to fast and agile to be an airplane or jet.  After a while we all saw helicopters and we thought they were government helicopters but it seemed very out of place to me.  Helicopters out of no where near Newark, New Jersey, very strange.  The helicopters were black and seemed dark since it was at night.  The strange thing was that the two helicopters look like they were tracking the red flashing objects in the sky but as soon as those helicopters came out chasing them the red flashing objects simply disappeared.  After the red flashing triangle like aircrafts disappeared the black helicopters hung around for a while using spot lights.  They even got close to the house we were in. They had to be only a few miles up in the air.    We all just thought of it as nothing but its really hard not to admit it.  We never talked about it again.  I assume that it was government related and if not that then it was definitely something foreign and not of this world.  I definitely know we weren&apos;t all seeing things because we turned on the radio and people in northern NJ area reported the Flashing red lights on 1010 winds i think its called . (The AM radio station channel).  Also down the street was a restaurant filled with people coming out to the parking lot after eating dinner who all witnessed the flying objects as well.

We then saw three more of them appear and fly in a standard V formation and then re-form at LIGHTNING speed (very very high up) into a few other odd formations and then dissapear.  These thing came into and out of view in a split second.  My friend checked them out with his binocolurs and said it appeared &quot;round&quot; with lights front and back.  Ok, i know, sounds like classic b.s.    Well, if they&apos;re planes, what in the flying hell are they doing such incredible stunts right over central Los Angeles for?    I tried to reach the FAA and Homeland Security at LAX and got an answering machine!  Lovely!  I spoke with someone (in the flurry of numbers i called) at a local airforce command station who said they had no flying going on in the area at the moment and ref&apos;d me here!  Nice one guys.  Gathering enemy threat in the skies? Cool, ref it over to UFOCentral! Jesus.  Not putting this site down, it&apos;s just that i&apos;d expect a little more from their response, let alone the FAA and Homeland Security.  After around 25 minutes more they were all gone.  They did not fly off north or south or east or west, they just vanished.I took pics but no luck, took video and got some of it - you can check it out here, but if i get too many downloads, i&apos;ll have to cut it.  I hope that someone will archive it and post it elsewhere if it&apos;s of use.  When you watch the clip, at 4 seconds into it you&apos;ll see a white dot in the top left quarter of the screen (you&apos;ll see the unfocused power lines running diagonally, follow the wires to find the white dot).  You&apos;ll see it, over the span of one second of film, it moves to the left across the power lines farther left and upwards.  (I&apos;m not saying the craft moved that fast, it was my camera motion that moved quickly).

As usual there were approx 4 groups of golfers and caddies playing.  It was a typical windy day with the winds coming from the east.  Across the estuary is RAF Leuchars.  I spotted a spherical shape approx 200 ft above the ground travel in a straight line approaching from the east or the 6th fairway of the New course and continue in a calm, straight line eastward across the 9th and 10th of the Old Course, the 8th and 13th of the New Course and 6th and 14th of the Jubilee on it&apos;s way out toward the North Sea.  At that point I lost track of it.  It occurred to me that this was a very odd sighting as I thought it was a plastic bag which had possibly escaped the trash.  My first thought was why wasn&apos;t it gusting with the strong winds but the object just kept moving at a constant, slow speed without wavering in any way.  It was as though it was attached to a track of some sort. I asked a collegue who was in the area if he had noticed the strange plastic in the sky but he did not see it.", "AS ME AND A FRIEND WERE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE WE SAW THESE UFOS.Me and a friend were on INTERSTATE 64 at EXIT 128 and we looked up and saw a circle UFO it had red, yellow, and brown lights on the inside of the bottom, then it had on the inside of the bottom all blue and purple lights and emitted red and yellow beams.

Diamond shaped object hovered directly over Milles Illes River to the right of me.Charbonneau Park - 23:00hrs - Thought sea plane was coming in over Milles Illes River for landing. Craft stopped directly in mid air to the right of me and hovered approximately 50 feet over the river.  Lost all radio signal in car. I got out of the car, walked down to the end of the dock to get up closer. There were lights on the object, which was probably the length of a bus. There was no noise except for a humming sound. I put my arms up for some strange reason.  All I can remember after that is standing there with my arms down to my sides as I watched the object leave.  It went to the right, then up to the left, and then went straight up. This probably took a matter of maybe 3 seconds before I could no longer see it. I got back into the car and it was 2:00am. There was 3 hours missing. I drove home and tried to sleep but couldn&apos;t, so I stood at my window which was in front of the house.  Rosemere is a small town that is in the lower laurentians.  Very few moose are seen in the area.  A bull moose walked right by the house and down the street while I was standing there by the window.  I woke my brother up to tell him. The next day, this was reported on the news as the moose was taken by helicopter way back up North to where it had originally travelled from. I moved to Ontario in October of that year. I developed an infection on my cheek, was hospitalised in Novemer with a major intestinal infection, and had to have 7-8 feet of intestine removed that had gone gangrenous. To this day, I can&apos;t seem to forget what I saw or understand why I saw it.

I do not have contact information for the witness presently, but I can get it.In 1977 the witness (age 17 at the time)and his cousin were returning home to obey their 12 a.m. curfew.  As they were heading up a road towards the Heights in Montgomery Village, MD, near Gaithersburg, the witness saw a light through some trees at the top of the hill and asked his cousin &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot;. His cousin replied &quot;They&apos;re digging a lake up there; it must be some construction lights.&quot;  They continued up the hill, came around a bend in the road, and saw a cigar-shaped object hovering over a telephone pole approximately 40 feet in the air and 50 feet in front of them. The witness and his cousin stopped the car and got out to look at the object, which he described as shaped like a &quot;one-manned submarine&quot;, being about the size of a school bus, and as having a metallic skin, 2 beams projecting from the &quot;front,&quot; and a row of &quot;portholes&quot; and non-blinking red and green lights around the circumference.  The object was completely silent and stationary for approximately 20 seconds, then made a soft, mechanical &quot;verrrt&quot; sound and began to move slowly away. The witness emphasized 2 things: how &quot;man-made&quot; and &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; the object seemed (&quot;like an airliner with no tail, wings, or jet engines&quot;) and the strange way that it appeared to move away slowly, yet diminished rapidly in size until it disappeared.  He had a difficult time describing exactly how the object departed. He said that the surface of the craft was visible from the glare of the projecting beams (&quot;kind&apos;a like laser beams, not spreading out like headlights&quot;), and that it was metallic.  There were also dark patches above the view ports where he thought there was some movement visible (as in something moving inside the object). The witnesses&apos; car exhibited no electromagnetic effects from the close proximity of the craft; the engine continued to idle and the headlights remained on, and neither witness suffered any physiological effects.  He said that he and his cousin were open-mouthed in amazement, but never felt frightened during the encounter. What also astonished the witness was that this sighting took place shortly before midnight in the middle of a suburban bedroom community with many houses in the area, but no one came out of their home to investigate the bright lights above their neighborhood.  He looked in the newspapers, but failed to find any reports of UFO sightings in the next several days.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Daylight: I was sitting on my south facing patio deck taking a break after doing some yard work.  Looked up and noticed an object that was the size of a small star (possibly reflecting sun light?).  The object appeared to be at commercial aircraft altitude (30k feet), but actual size of object and altitude is a guess.   Object was at eleven o-clock position in the sky and moved very slowly west (approximately two inches at arms length, would stop, then slowly continue path west, pause and then headed south in a gentle arc, to approximately two o-clock position. Movement was intentional and did not appear to drift.  No sudden accelerations, or wobbling, just even paced, then pauses.  This was not a commercial aircraft at 30k, both because of movement, speed and size.  Maybe a weather balloon, if they still use them, but the pauses (hovering) in movement seemed to last way too long.  It was very difficult to keep my eye on it because it was so small and daylight.

It was in the form of an isosceles triangle with red lights along the leading two edges.  They didn&apos;t blink and what struck me as strange was that there was no green light like on a conventional aircraft and the odd formation they were in.

As we reached the crest of the hill that led down to our home, I noticed a white/silvery light in the distance over the trees as we looked almost due east (or barely southeast). There was nothing else in sky as it was a clear summer day and I called attention to this unknown light to my mother. She was surprised at the light and pulled the car over to the side of the road and we began watching the light in the distance(it was off in the distance but I can only guess 10-20 miles away.  When I first spotted this light what caught my attention was the fact that it was at times stationary but would then move up in a direct perpendicular line and would then sometomes move sideways in a direct horizontal line. These movements were in the blink of an eye and guessing at the distance I would say these horizontal and perpendicular movements were many miles in seconds. We watched this movement for about 15 minutes and the mental image I have is of this unknown light/object making a cross or plus sign in the sky.  As we watched this movement we both commented and agreed that there was nothing we knew of on this earth that could move and change directions so quickly and stop in an an instant. As we were watching this movement for about 15 minutes all of a sudden the light blinked out. This surprised us and we were going to proceed on home when the light blinked back on and reappeared in about the same spot as we originally saw it.  It made a few more horizontal/perpendicular movements and blinked out again and did not reappear. The total duration of this event was about 20 minutes. My mother and I were perplexed at this event because we had no explanation for what we had seen.

Obviously not man-made aircraft, at least one the public does not know about.  Observing object through binoculars, notice there seems to be no definite shape and a multitude of colorful lights is constantly revolving or moving around the object.

A dim luminous object in the sky caught my eye at about 11:00 above and to my slightly forward left.  I had to look out the window and look almost straight up to see this object.  I drove almost two miles to Murrieta Hot Springs road while slowing and viewing this object.  While driving the object never moved from it&apos;s position in the sky.  The object was the size of my thumbnail at arms length.  To not alter it&apos;s position in the sky over two miles horizontal on the ground says something of the height and size of this object. The object was exactly triangle in shape.  It&apos;s luminosity was about a 10 watt bulb viewed from across a large room with an old lampshade covering the light.  It was a dull brown/gold in color.  It had a distinuished dark band that outlined the perimeter and appeared to be darker than the moonless night sky.  However the most strange element of this sighting was what appeared to be the underside, the side I could see.  The surface seemed to be in turmoil.  I would describe it as what you would see on a TV set with a screen full of snow on a channel without programming. I pulled over just before I got to Murrieta Hot Springs Road to grab my camera in my glove box.  I just got back from Lake Mead with my boys and had not yet turned in the disposable camera for developing.  I stopped my truck while still watching the object.  In the time it took me to reach over to my glove box for the camera and look back out to take a picture, the object was gone.  I was standing outside the truck with a complete view of the sky and saw no hint of the object anywhere....... I had not noticed any sound.  The object appeared to be very close to me, but with the distance I traveled and the object maintaining it&apos;s position in the sky, it had to be very large and very high. February 2006;  I was again driving home late at night, ~12:00 a.m. from my shop.  My girlfriend was with me at this time.  We were heading north on I-15.  Just pass California Oaks off ramp, we both noticed a very bright light hovering just above the horizon about NW, 10:30 from our position.  It was very strange in that there was no traffic in our direction.  No lights ahead and one set of lights very far behind us.  Very unusual for the busy I-15.  We commented on the brightness of the lights.  Like they were pointed right at us.  They were brighter than any aircraft lights I&apos;ve ever seen.  But there were 3 together but distinctly separate.  We thought it may be a helicopter.  It moved ever so slightly towards us, maintaining it&apos;s altitude.  We continued to comment on the strangeness.  As we approached Bundy Canyon, the object seemed to start to draw a bead on us.  Again there was oddly no other traffic in our direction, but a sporadic car passing on the opposite side heading south. As we passed Bundy the object was now even with us and within a 1/4 mile to the direct West of us and falling slightly behind us, say to the 8:00 position.  It&apos;s altitude was maybe 200&apos;.  It then turned and maintained running parallel to our direction exactly off at 9:00.  It maintained that distance for ~ 1/4 mile, then moved in to us.  It continued to fly directly over the truck.  I become very uneasy and speed up to around 100 mph, because I felt like it may hit us.  It flew directly above us for maybe a 1/2 mile and then started to veer off to the East and disengaged slowly.  I could not see it off the passenger side except for just a couple of glimpses.  My girlfriend continued to eye it.  She said it then shot off to the East at an extremely high rate of speed.  Faster than a jet she said. Strange facts:  NO noise.  This object made absolutely NO noise, even flying about 100&apos; above us. Three aircraft type landing lights up front and two of the same type lights in the assumed &quot;Rear&quot; of the object. NO traditional navigation lights or strobes. And the most amazing aspect of all is that there was no visible body.  We could not make out any physical type of structure to the object.  NO wings, NO fuselage, NO body.  Just lights and void between the lights.  Even as the object came over head, we could not see any type of body.  The object did appear to be circular only becuase of the way the lights were positioned. I would estimate the size to be maybe 20&apos; to 30&apos;. I figured you may like to add these sightings to what ever compilation you may have. Thank you((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The research I have done on this craft resembles the one seen over mountains in Las Vegas I belive. If not Las Vegas, they were seen somewhere in California over mountains. The craft I saw was identical to the one if the video of the one over the mountains accept the one I saw was slow moving, then all of the sudden tilted and flew until I could not see it; a building was then blocking my move. I know 100% that this was not a known craft. At least the &quot;people&quot; do not know what it is. Whether it is a government craft or a space craft I will not know for the time being. This was a great experience for me, but will keep me wondering for awhile. Also, this would have been a very clear video if I would have pulled out my camera in time. This was a very quick event. I am hoping to have more experiences like this in my life time.", "UFO over the San Gabriel ValleyI was out walking my dog and at about 9:30P.M. when I saw the red light in the sky.  It did not move like an ordinary airplane you see over Los Angeles, rather it moved like something I have never seen before.  I saw the object move very slowly and it never got close nor did it move away like a normal plane would.  I called out my parents to see if they could see what I was seeing and they also saw what i was seeing.  By this time the object was moving in strange patterns.  All these movements occured in the west to the north west parts of the sky.  I saw it move very quikly to the left, right, up, down, inward, outward, and In circular motions. At one point my mother and I were able to see the shape of the craft, which was similar to a boomerang.  The red light was centered in the middle area of the craft.  We did have binoculars to see this object and this helped out in viewing it.  My parents went inside the house after observing it for a while, but I stayed out and saw it linger there for quite a while. As i watched it, my neighboor had just arrived home and I told her if she could see the same thing.  She wanted to go inside her house after a long day, but she stood out for a few moments to observe this craft.  We looked at it together and it did some king of loop-de-loop action then it dipped down and dissapeared from sight at approximaetly  10:20 P.M.  The duration of the sighting was for 50 min.", "Golden flying wing.It was just after midnight.  I was looking up and noticed what I thought may have been an owl at first flying low and close to street lights.  The reason I thought that was because the light given off was a golden or light orange color.  Then I realized the figure was up higher and moving faster.  I thought it was a plane but it had no blinking red or green lights.  By this time my friend was looking on.  We both notice how fast it was moving though it was not streaking.My freind said it looked like it had a bar of lights on the underneath side of the craft.  I would resemble it to a flying wing that was completely illuminated on the underside with its lights having partioning lines between them.It appeared so large at first that I thought it could have been an owl perhaps 50 yards away illuminated by street lights.  This thing just kept on going and was out of site much more quickly than a plane that stared out looking that big. The direction it was flying in was southwest.  It disappeared within a span of 15 seconds. Again, it appeared to have the shape of a flying wing or just a bank of lights like a somewhat rectangular thing flying with the wide side forward.((NUFORC Note:  We believe that a wedge of migratory birds would first have to be ruled out, before it could be concluded that the witnesses observed a genuine UFO.

On a clear, dark night in June, my friend, who was 12 and I were spending the night in my treehouse. We had decided to go for a walk in the field behind my house. We looked up into the sky and to the North, we saw a yellow-orange colored oval (laying sideways) shaped UFO that was slowly crossing the sky from the East to the West. Four white diamond shaped objects appeared from the tail end of the oval and followed it in a straight line. I remember turning to my friend and asking him if he was seeing what I was seeing. He said that he was and that we weren&apos;t dreaming. We watched it for about 25 seconds, then while they were traveling, the last diamond object emitted a bright red light and then shot quicky back and downwards in a arc away from the others. The other three then continued moving West in a straight line for a few seconds, then took off at a high rate of speed in different directions. Following this, the oval object paused for 3 or 4 seconds then shot into the sky at a 45 degree angle at a high rate of speed. We watched it until it went out of site.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Coming from the South, going towards North/Northwest.

I said to my cousin that i must be seing things because it looks like that star just moved, but he replied that he had seen it too. I focused my attention to that part of the sky and this &quot;star&quot; was stationary in one position then seemed to turn off and immediately reappear in another fixed location in the sky. this continued for several minutes each time the &quot;star&quot; would do this appearing and reappering in the same two spots each time, it seemed to stay in the original position that it was first spotted in for a longer time than the other. The best way i can describe it is if it was jumping back and forth between these too points. We saw no movement of this light from point a to b it just seemed like someone was flipping a light switch on and off. Also noteably it did not seem to be in the atmosphere although i could be wrong, and there was not a cloud one in the sky. It looked just like all the other stars in the sky except &quot;jumping&quot; and brighter than the surronding stars yet not the brightest object, i wouldn&apos;t say, in the whole sky. Now, i dont know about alien spaceship but it was definatly very weird and i have come across one other person whose decribed to me something very similar which he saw indepentantly and at a different time than me. I would like to know if anyone else has seen such a &quot;star&quot; because it bothers me to this day.

It was a clear, cloudless night. The stars shown brilliantly against the dark sky. I stood looking up at the stars in the heavens, when suddenly I noticed a moving &quot;light&quot; very high up in the sky. I knew, from the altitude that this moving &quot;light&quot; appeared  to be, that whatever it was that I was looking at, must either be the space-station, or a satillite. The light maintained its altitude, but when it was directly above me, I was dumbstruck by the sudden brilliance of a brightness that suddenly seemed to appear from the bottom of this object when the object got directly overhead. There seemed to be four (4)lights that were part whatever it was that I was looking at. I felt that what I was seeing was triangular in shape, with white, non-blinking lights on three cornors, with the bottom, suddenly brilliant &quot;beam&quot; in the middle of the other three. AT NO TIME DID ANY OF THE LIGHTS THAT I SAW &apos;BLINK,&apos; AS THEY WOULD HAVE IF THIS WERE AN AIRPLANE! The light then proceeded to change course. It made a turn; not abrupt, but a gradual, gentle course change. It then accelerated, gaining speed quite rapidly, and I watched it until it trailed off from sight. The bright &quot;beam&quot; that I refer to, in the middle of this object, seemed to gain in luminosity when it was directly over my head. In other words, one second, it wasn&apos;t bright. Then, quite suddenly, when it was directly overhead, it was! I ruled out an airplane, as they have red, and green blinking lights on their wings. I thought that the brilliant light &quot;beam&quot; could have been an airplanes landing lights. But there was no change in the luminosity that should have accompanied the deployment of landing lights in front of or around this object. Besides, with no blinking of any kind noted, it seemed unlikely that this was an aircraft. I stood there, wondering what it was I had seen, for several minutes after I finally lost sight of this object. I have spent many moments in the past looking up at the heavens. This was my second UFO (if this was one) sighting. The first occurred over 53 years ago. This is my first report to NUFORC, even though I look at the site often.

Thought they might be planes or helicopters but there was no noise and no blinking.  They moved with such percision.  They moved in formation for a while and then took off to the West one by one at an unbelievable speed.  I could not tell what the shapes of the objects were but they put off enough light so we could see them.  We thought they had left and then suddenly they reappered in the same general location 10 minutes later.  This time only 2 were seen.  Both of the objects were  stationary while one of them suddenly flew away from the other at an incredible speed and then suddenly stopped all in the matter of seconds.  Then the object that distanced itself from the other flew very slowly to the north and then began dropping stuff.  It made a slight popping noise, almost looking like and sounding like a firecracker.  The stuff that it dropped seemed to disappear with in seconds after it released it.

Between Belleville and Centerville IL, there is about a 5-8 mile strrtch of wood encompassed Highway, and thats when we saw and experienced the following events: About a mile or so past Fairview Hieghts, I inexplicablly had the sensation to look over my shoulder and to the left of me. At that moment I noticed something very out of the ordinary. Shining down on the surface of the adjacent, Westbound side of Interstate 64/40 were three blue circles of light. Even stranger, was that these concentric circles were pacing our car...in the same direction we were traveling, on the opposing westbound highway. Then what seemed to begin happening is that a state of...Oh well,What can I do...feeling came over me, not fear or panic, just....Oh well.

Only, at the end of the contrail, and seemingly following the jetliner, was a bright green, glowing sphere of light. As soon as I noticed it though and called for my griend to qiickly grab her camera, it seemed to take notice in me. It bounced arounded and darted from point to point in the sky, almost as if it were putting on a show for me, just to make a point of saying &quot;Hi you can see me, I also see you.&quot; It kept this up until my friend returned with her camera, at which point this object shot right to my zenith. She quickly snapped a picture, and with that the object simply zipped off out of view.

We were outside for maybe 15 minutes talking and I happened to look up and something caught my attention. A dimm, yellow round light hovering in the sky about a mile and a half away. It was hovering about 100 feet in the air. When I noticed it I told my friend to look at it, I pointed at it. We both had no clue what it could be because the light was too big to be a helicopter, and we knew it wasnt an airplane. About 2 minutes after we spotted the object, we saw something very strange! The erea where the object was hovering over is a resivior (Sweetwater Resivior) which is our water supply. The object began dropping things into the resivior. The objects it was dropping fell very slowly and illuminated with many different colors. Rainbow colored objects. It was unbelievable. I couldnt determine the size of the illuminating objects, but they seemed to sparkle as they fell. On and off. After about 3 munutes of dropping things into the water, it vanished.

I followed the line till it dropped straight down forming the back end of what looked like a triangle. As I kept looking I saw that the lines were moving. The clouds were moving as well but the triangle was moving faster. I couldn&apos;t see the object but only the outer edge where it met the clouds.

While we were marching, we all just stopped as we saw three bright lights approach us over water (04:00 hours am). The three lights seemed to come in close to us, and glow brighter as they approached. All of a sudden, they grew smaller, and flew off in three different directions at great speed. I THEN continued taking the troops to the mess hall.

But when we arrived back at the barracks, I went to the drill instructors door, knocked, and he came out. After all the usual harrassment, he told me to step into his office. Once I told the drill instructor what happened, he did the unexpected, and closed the door and talked to me like a human. He invited all of the other troops who were with me into his office (after calling the other drill instructors into his office). The other boots went in one-by-one, and also came out unscathed. &lt;&gt; IF YOU KNOW Parris Island,... that is saying something.The next day, I was called into the drill instructors office again, and there were two men in suits and sunglasses there.

The object was very large; I would guess it to be about the size of a very large jumbo jet.  It was shaped like an isosceles triangle, with steady blue-white lights positioned at each of the points. The object seemed to be black in color and not extremely thick for its size, I would guess it to have been about 6-8 meters in thickness.  The most unusual characteristic of the object was a marked lack of engine noise.  I stopped the car, and got out to watch the object. I observed the object for about four minuets at about half a football field&rsquo;s distance during which time the object slowly moved North East at seemingly moderate and steady pace, still without any real engine noise except a slight whirring noise.  I then returned to my car and went home unshaken by the experience but contemplating the unusualness of what I had just witnessed.

I observed it for a moment but I couldn&apos;t figure out what it was, so I told my mom to take a look at it. She said that she could see it too. It was to the west of 1-15 and since it was about 8:45 pm, the sky was getting darker and darker, but there was still faint light so we could see the shadow of it in the sky. I would say it was about 100-200 feet of the ground and it flew at a constant speed until it seemed to disappear among the background of the mountains, but after a few minutes it reappeared again. I only saw one of them, and it was just big and black, and it was a diamond-shaped object. It emitted no lights whatsoever.", "Flashing lights in the sky. Moving way too fast to be an aircraft and made no sound.On May 27 at approx. 0030 hrs I observed what I first thought was an approaching aircraft out of the west. This would be a normal activity. It was a cloudy night as we had just had thunderstorms and althought the rain had stopped clouds still hung in the sky. The first observation was of a double pulse of white light that i initailly thought were wing beacons as the pulsed twice very rapidly. I waited for the secound pulse and when it came the object had moved way too fast in the sky. it now appeared almost directly overhead with the same two pulse beacon light. It stayed in the same area with the secound sighting. and pulsed there with the same two white flashes about 8 times in the course of 2 and a half mins. during this whole time the object made no sound. even thought it appeared to be directly overhead. Then back on the horizon I observed an actual aircraft that headed east toward my location ( Commerical aircraft ) and the turned to the north. This aircraft as it got closer had sound and it never came close. As I waited for the pulse of beacons I observed it pulse twice more as it shot back across the horizon from the south to the north just above the tree line. What ever it was it was very very fast and made no sound that i could hear. I never actually saw a craft just the two pulses of bright white light very close together and it seemed to have no sequence, in the time between the pulses. The cloud ceiling was low but I don&apos;t know what hight it was, but surely if an aircraft was under the cloud ceiling and moved like this thing I would have heard some noise from the engines.I have been a Police Officer for 11 years and prior to that I was in the Air Force stationed in Dover Delaware. I have never saw or claimed to have seen a UFO until now. I am sure it can be explained. For several moments I thought it might have been a glider, But again it moved way to fast from one spot in the sky to another", "Multiple luminous objects sighted in night sky(Note to receiver: I am sending this again because I saw in the confirmation page that my apostrophes didn&apos;t display correctly as I copied and pasted the report from Microsoft Word. Please accept my apologies.)  I would like to report a series of object sightings that took place in the early hours of this past Thursday morning. I would have reported it on Thursday, but unfortunately did not have the time to do so. I observed multiple luminous objects again this (Friday) morning, and will fill out a separate report for this. As I mentioned in the one previous report I sent to your website (2/19/05), as I was an astronomy student for many years, and still enjoy it as a hobby, I am familiar with the sky and the phenomena it can present, and also know about optical illusions like the one that occurs when you stare at a star for a few seconds and it appears to jump around in place. I also have very good eyesight (20/10). I say these things merely to let you know the type of observer I am. The sightings began at 0055 on Thursday morning, when I was settling into bed. I sleep with my curtains open, and as my bed is right next to my window, I sometimes look at the sky before I go to sleep. I live out in the Scottish countryside, where there is little light pollution, so we get some fantastic nights when the clouds stay off. This night was a totally clear night and remained so until sunrise, which is very early here in the summer (about 0430 right now, so my viewing window is short). A bright object moving in a southeast-northwesterly direction caught my eye. It was simply a white light the size of a star with no other light on or around it, and it moved slightly faster than an airplane would have at that estimated altitude. It then gave off a bright flash the size of a pinkie fingernail held at arm&apos;s length that was about twice the magnitude of Sirius. This lasted 1 second, then it continued on its course until it flew over my house and out of sight. I could hear no noise coming from the sky at this time. I immediately jumped up and grabbed a pen and paper from the table in my room in case any other objects appeared and I could write down anything noteworthy.  Approximately 1 minute later, I saw two other objects heading in the same direction as this previous object. They were also both the size of a star and consisted of nothing but a point of white light, however, these 2 were lower in magnitude than the first. They flew very close to one another, a distance of 2 dimes held at arm&apos;s length. I continued to watch them until they disappeared out of sight. I did not have my digital camera or my binoculars in my room at this point, but I was so riveted by this that I could not bear to turn my eyes away. I started to need to use the toilet halfway through the night, but did not dare leave then, either. In any case, I knew that my camera&apos;s memory was full and its battery was not charged (though its video feature does not produce good video of the night sky anyway). From this point on, these objects continued to appear, one after the other, again and again that night. Their altitudes and magnitudes varied, but they were all simply points of white light with no position lights that an aircraft would have (I confirmed this the following night with my binoculars). I jotted down details as I went along, but I was working in almost no light, except the light that was coming from outside, so my notes are not as thorough as the next night, when I had an Indiglo light that I turned on whenever I needed to write something, and was able to record the exact time and heading of each object. After one object had disappeared from view, I would stare at the center of the sky, let everything fall out of focus, and wait for any moving points of light to appear. When one appeared, I would then follow that one until it disappeared, and so on. The headings of the objects were mainly southeast-northwest and west-east. In total, I counted 14 of these objects and up to 3 unusual (what appeared to be) conventional aircraft. After the 2nd and 3rd objects I mentioned that appeared together, a new object would appear approximately every 5 minutes for the first half of the group or so (the intervals grew as time went on), and travel in one of the headings mentioned above until it was out of sight. Their movements were straight and precise, though faster than a passenger airplane. Their speeds and magnitudes would vary. One object, the 11th object, was particularly noteworthy. It seemed to appear very low in the sky, at about 10 degrees elevation, then began moving vertically upwards. It did not move straight up, but in a sort of side to side aberrant motion, even one time moving down a little before moving up. After it had reached about 30 degrees in the sky, it travelled straight down again at tremendous speed accompanied by a streak of bright white light, brighter than Sirius. It disappeared after this. It travelled a distance of about from the tip of my thumb to my wrist held at arm&apos;s length in less than 1 second. There was another white object after this, same in appearance as the previous, then I noticed what appeared to be an aircraft flying towards my direction (southeast-northwest) from where the bright object was. As it approached I could hear it, and it had green and red position lights on its right and left wings, respectively. It also had a very large (the size of the head of a tack held at arm&apos;s length), pulsating white light on the underside of its fuselage. I have not seen this type of light on an aircraft before, but I am not an expert on aircraft lighting. It flew over my house at an altitude of at least 10,000 feet, I would estimate. I could hear it in the sky after it flew past my house, until its noise faded out of range. I should note that passenger aircraft are not that common in our area as others, perhaps due to our location relative to the airports in the country as well as the path of other flight routes passing over the country. Our sky never seems to have any contrails in it. An aircraft of any type is uncommon, save for the fighter jets from the nearby air force base, especially at night (I hear the occasional passenger aircraft during the day when they do pass, but almost never night for some reason, even when I am up very late), and therefore one of this appearance was even more bizarre. I was to see what was either the same aircraft making more passes, or 1 or 2 other aircraft of the same type making passes, twice later on that night. It is impossible to say if it was the same craft as the first time I saw it, it passed over my house and I did not have visual contact with it the entire time. I happened to note the time of this craft, and that was at 0204. The second and third planes, the last objects I saw that night, appeared at 0253 and 0258 respectively, both heading west-east. The last white object I saw was at 0235, and I went to bed shortly after 0300. The number and behaviour of these objects is what astounded me. I have watched meteor showers before and knew they weren&apos;t meteors. The fact that the two white objects that in particular displayed remarkable characteristics were identical to the myriad of other white objects makes it hard for me to accept at the present moment that these other objects were conventional aircraft. I should note that there is an air force base, RAF Leuchars, approximately 10 km to the northeast of here. Their fighter jets can be seen and heard flying in the skies here every day, but never at night, and make a considerable noise even when at high altitudes. The average altitude of the objects was hard to determine. They could have been small objects quite close, or large objects considerably far away. My best estimate would be between 20,000 and 30,000 feet. I am not here to report conclusively what the objects were, as I cannot say this, but only to pass on this information. I will continue to monitor the sky here and report any other activity.", "UFO Disc covers their  identity behind dark clouds but was later seen from a sharp eye before taking off.On this particular evening it was a dark cloudy, light rain overcast.

Well I was looking very hard at this one particular dark cloud for at least 30 secnds with this extremely bright light coming from the center.

Drove a little out of town so i could see the stars better... no city lights. Stopped on the crest of a hill and pulled of onto the dirt from paving. right away a bright red star caught my attention. thought maybe a planet. suddenly, it started moving in a straight line to the south east at a steady quick pace. it seemed to align with another constellation, stop, hover, and then disapeared. I got scared and decided to go back in town and watch from there. drove down by the saskatchewan river, stopped the car, and played some music, and watched another reddish light seemingly apear out of nowhere, and move in a straight line to the north. it moved like the first only this one disapeared without realigning with other stars. My wife then called me on my cell and asked where i was. I told her i was down by the river watching strange lights. She asked me to pick her up, and so i did. We decided to go out of town again because i felt a little braver with my wife with me. We stopped in almost the same place as i had been before, and watched a total of 5 lights appear, manuever across the sky at fast paces, and seemingly change course quickly, zig zag, half circle, usually crossing about 1/3 of the night sky. One in particular began very dim, and at a point in its travel, flared very bright for a count of 1 second or less, then became dim again. My wife exclaimed &quot;holy shit, did you see that?&quot; and yes i had, and my reaction was quite similar but i did not express the words. These sightings of these seven lights, lasted 2 hours nearly as we continued to watch the night sky intensly and would exclaim to each other &quot;Ive Got One&quot;. really quite the eye opener for me, and my wife. We both concluded they were not jets as they moved too fast, appeared from nowhere, hovered in star formations, zigzagged on their flight paths, change light from dim to flaring bright, and disapeared as fast as they appeared. take this for what you will. I will be watching the skys for a while now, and will never trust that a star is in fact a star again.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I live about eight miles from IAH airport. I watch the planes as they take off and land on a nightly bases. If i had to estimate the the speed and altitude, I would say they were about the same altitude as the planes as they fly over, but moving at a higher speed about double the speed of the planes as they take off.Moving from south to north this object flew directly over me and was straight above me when i noticed it. It was a pinkish orange in color, appeared to be spherical in shape although it also seemed to have more of a globular shape. The color was strange because Ive never seen a object this color. Almost as if it was a thick translucent color. Completly silent as it moved at a steady speed until it vanished into the horizon.As i stood there trying to figure out what that was. A few minutes later another one came into view moving at about the same altitude and speed as the first one. This second one was a little darker in color more of an orangish red. Moving this time from east to west.Now a person could say that since i live close to the airport that they were planes. These were not planes! They were completly silent, They were of a solid color by that i mean they were not flashing or strobing like the planes do. And these were not just lights either. You could actually see a a shape, almost as if they were lit from the interior with no exterior lighting.", "White cylinder  fallowed  airforce jets for about 10 to 15 min. untill out of sight.Standing in a friends back yard, I was watching airforce jets from Whiteman airforce base flying west at about 10,000 ft. {maybe a little lower }. I looked behind the last jet about, 2 to 5 miles, and saw a white cylinder flying at what appered to be the same height and speed. I pointed the object out to my friend and he also saw it. He said it looked like a missile but the object was blunt at both ends and was flying at the same speed as the airforce jets. Also there were no tail fins or wings at all.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My friend was exiting Couch Street and that was when she called my attention and another friends attention to the out if the ordinary view outside. When she called my attention, I could see the objects but now there were four of them. The objects were orange and glowing at the same time and they were at a complete stop. But then they all started to move S/SE. They were moving very slowly. As my friend turned left on NW Couch street, she slowed down to get a better look at them. She kept on going straight and on about 14th and Couch Street, she came to a complete stop. All three of us that were in the car were able to get a better view of the glowing objects. They were two more directly above the car. I noticed two of them. They were at a complete stop for about a minute or so. Then the objects started moving S/SE following the previous four objects. They were moving very slowly as if drifting. They were glowing orange, but it was hard to see any definite shape. The glow was in slow motion. One of the objects got smaller and then bigger again. After they started to move S/SE, we proceeded E on Couch to 10th street. On 10th street, we were at a three way stop. Four of the objects were above a white building. We watched them for at least three minutes. We proceeded E to NW Broadway were we turned right into an abandoned building&apos;s parking lot. My friend in the passenger seat called 911. They told her to call the UFO center in Wa State. The driver of the car called the UFO center and made a report. I watched the objects at this point, but they faded away as they were headed S/SE.((NUFORC Note:  One of several sighting reports from residents of Portland.

I remember someone saying &quot; Hey look, a shooting star ! &quot; So everyone looked  directly upwards and identified what we thought was a shooting star. It moved and looked like a shooting star. I mean, it was as far , far up in the sky and seemed like it was a star itself.So everyone just went about there business afterwards. But about 3 minutes later someone noticed that the star was still shooting. I told everyone that it might just be a satalite or something. But boy was I wrong. It moved at the same speed as when we noticed earlier. But all of a sudden the &quot;star&apos; had moved from right above us to directly in front of us and it still looked like it was  far away, like a star.

It did not slow done at all. And then it grew in size and changed in color. It went from a small star to a big round light. Then, the color changed from white,orange and finally bright red. I mean that thing turned into a blinking stop light.We could not believe what we were watching. Some how, this tiny shooting star had turned into a big,bright blinkin light.

I remember it being in the local newspapers the next day and that numerous people had reported it. If I remember rightly it had also been reported to the coastguard. I was on my way to football practice at the time. We practised on a small field under some street lighting close to Aberavon beach. On our way there I noticed some lights in the sky behaving oddly. At first I thought it  might be aircraft dogfight training as the lights seemed to be dancing around each other. I then noticed what seemed to be a cylinder shape at the centre which could only be defined by the lights on it. I could not see any physical solid shape. These lights continued revolving and cartwheeling and slowly moving away towards a slightly misty horizon until they dissapeared. This sighting alone amazed me as it lasted what seemed a good 10 minutes which gave me enough time to discern that these lights were not aircraft of any sort that I had ever seen. About 20 minutes later as we were playing football I noticed more lights in the distance heading towards us. I stopped playing football to clearly observe them. They were moving slowly and at first I saw four lights that as they got closer changed into three lights and a triangular shape was clearly discernable. To my amazement the lights passed directly overhead. I couldn&apos;t make out any sound or see any shape in between the lights. I can only guess at the size. It seemed to be about the size of a British Vulcan bomber or bigger. It passed over slowly and as I mentioned earlier there was absolutely no sound. Then, not long after it passed overhead it  pointed upwards and ascended vertically at exactly the same slow speed until it disappeared. This amazed me as I know of no aircraft that can do this for that duration and speed. Shortly after two aircraft appeared which led me to the conclusion that they were looking for these lights.", "Lancashire, UK at about 9:30pm, an UFO passed over a crowd on BIG BROTHER live on Channel 4.

Fort Chaffee military flares or UFOs ?I was sitting on my fathers truck last night when I noticed a circular orange light flashing for approx 4 seconds and then dissapearing and reappearing in the sky.   I called for my sister and her friend to come look.  The light continued to do this for about 5 minutes, dissapearing and then reappearing.  I can&apos;t give an approx measurement or altitude, but the lights were rather bright compared to that of a normal star and the altitude seemed low for military aircraft.  Although I do not know much of military aircrafts and dropping flares at night, there was no sound or smoke. I live pretty close to Fort Chaffee, so I assummed that if they were flares, then we could of heard the planes or seen the smoke, but I didn&apos;t rule that possibility out.  After the lights faded, my sister and I sat outside and they finally appeared in the same area about 10 minutes later.  The lights began to do exactly what they did before, but this time there was only 1 of them.  It disseapered for only a few seconds and repeared much higher than it was before, and then suddenly about 5 or 6 appeared at once around that orange light.   These did not move and remained in one place for only 4 seconds. Then one by one, starting from the end, they dissappeared.  Because they appeared in a straight line, I began to think they might have been flares.  I am not totally convinced that what we saw was an alien aircraft, but we heard/saw no planes nearby.  The only reason why I am considering this may have been a ufo is because as far as I know, as long as gravity exists, flares do not hover in the sky instead of falling down as they disappeared. The disappearence seemed dramatic instead of random flares being dropped at once and disseapearing altogether and the same time. I don&apos;t know if anyone else saw this and I don&apos;t know what to think of it. My sister and her friend are convinced that aliens are here in Arkansas to invade...  and as convincing as these theories may be, I still remain a bit skeptical on ufo sightings.", "walking home i saw a gray saucer in the sky!!!!!!i was twelve years old. i was coming home from school which was down my street.  i looked up at my neighbors house and between the roof and the tree i saw a gray saucer. i remember it like it was yesterday.  it had a dome top and dome bottom and completely gray.  i stood there for what seemed like eternity and watched it pass from the branch to the back of the house.  after it passed, i ran inside to grap a camera, and my mom said where have you been?  i told her i was outside and she said she had been calling my name for half an hour, but i never heard her.  it was complete silence.  after 18 years, i still can remember the cars on the street, the colors of the houses, and the sounds of the neighborhood.  i never told anyone till now because my sister was military intelligence in the army.  but sitting here at the age of 30 i know what i saw!((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I shut the fridge door and turned around to go back to my room. As I did that, I took a deep drink from my cup and looked up, and out of the window, I saw a purple spiral hovering in the sky, slowly rotating. The spiral was made from a soft glow of purple light, that was unlike any light that I have ever seen, and nothing more. It was about the size of a quarter if you held it up to the sky. I took a good look at the object for about 3 seconds, and I knew that it was something very, very strange. I got scared and ran back to my room.

I asked my passenger if he saw that light up ahead and if he could see where it was coming from.  At first we both thought it was one of those giant spotlights that business&apos; shine into the sky to attract customers.

Wait! It&apos;s fading away...I can barely see it...it&apos;s gone.&quot;  I don&apos;t know what it was but it was crazy and nothing like the two of us had EVER seen before.

It was moving downwards pretty rapidly, in a smooth, almost floating movement. There were no flashing lights on it that we could see. There was a sort of haze arount the object. We watched it continue down for about a minute before we lost it behind some trees. But, before it went behind the trees it seemed like it was beginning to fade out. It was way too slow for a meteorite but didn&apos;t seem like a regular aircraft.Just so you know, my husband is a very conservative 53 year old man, I am a 48 year old grandmother of 5 and this is the second UFO sighting ( if indeed that is what it was) we have see from our front yard.

After the red stroke of beam vanished there was red sparkles from the same window of the Grand Hotel in UK and then immediately after that I saw five UFOs, all five of them was the same colour and they turned at the same speed and distances from each other near the Grand Hotel above the Sea.PS Something tells me it all leads down to the Grand Hotel.

I was littraly trained to identify hundreds of aircraft, both Nato and non Nato aircraft; within five to seven secounds, my gunner within ten secounds.  To this day i&apos;m still pretty good at it.  I live next to the bigest army base in the United States so I still get plenty of practice. The inccident happened as I was leaving Los Vagas on my way back to Texas. I was driving through the dessert heading East, off to my right front on my passenger side, I noticed a silver oval object very bright and relecting the sun.  At first I thought it was a jet plain, but as it got closser it did not fit any profile I ever seen.  It actually seamed to me as if it was bird dogging me.  It made several mennuvers up and down as it decreased and icreased in spead. If it was a human pilot in that aircraft I would think the goverment may have come up with some sort of new G-suit, becouse it would have definetly turned him or her into putty. Anyway it really started to give me the willies so I got on my C-B Radio and tried to reach somebody, anybody, I just wanted to see if any one else was seeing what I was seeing.  Well I never did get a responce back, the whole thing lasted for about 15-min.  The dammed thing seamed to littraly just blink out of exitstance.  I never told any one about it, never really felt compailed to do so.  But reacently I have thought about that day qwiet a bit.  I even dreamed about it several times. it started to bug me more and more the more I think obout it the more it bugs me. Well any way I really felt like I had tell somebody.  I still havent told anyone I know I don&apos;t think I can; becouse receantly I started to get treatment for depression and I don&apos;t want any one to think i&apos;m going nuts.

I saw what at 1st glance seemed to be the star that&apos;s discribed on this sight as a usual false sighting, but I realized that the star discribed was in a different part of the sky (I realized this because I like to watch it flash different colors sometimes when I&apos;m looking at the sky.). I belive the star I sometimes watch is more to the Southwest, so it caught my attention. Immediatly after thinking this, I observed the object to move extreamly rapid for the distance it appeared to be from our position (I am an air traffic controller, so I am aware of &quot;normal&quot;, or fighter jet aircraft movment.).  I closed my eyes, and shook my head a little to focus on the object to see if my eyes were playing tricks on me, and it continued to move rapidly, change directions instantly, and stop in place. I called my soldier over to confirm if it was acually moving, and he confirmed. As we watched;  another couple of minutes past, and over the tower radio frequency (Our facility monitors the control towers radios.)  I heard a broken transmission from what sounded like a pilot that said &quot;...yea, it&apos;s a triangle...&quot;. Tower came over the frequency, and told the transmitter to &quot;check freq.&quot;, which means your transmitting over our frequency, and your not supposed to.  If anyone who&apos;s reading this knows anything about aviation radio language, there is nothing anywhere about any triangle that would need to be transmitted to anyone. I continued to watch the object, using a fixed object placed in my line of sight just below it to ensure myself my eyes weren&apos;t tricking me after starring at this thing for a while. It contiued moving irratically, and moving in the same area in the sky for about 30 minutes, and then seemingly dissapeared. It was to far away to make out a shape, but it appeared that depending on the direction of movement, it was emitting different colors (Perhaps different colors on different sides of the object, and depending on what side was facing me; it would show the other colors?)

As it did this a vortex of gasseous vapor appeared from where the oject was moving, the vapor continued spreading out and the object repeated the maneuvers. About 10 minutes later a sudden and powerful thunderstorm came, and lasted for about 15-20 minutes. Afterwards the sky cleared up and there was no sign of the object.

We have a direct view of the Pacific ocean at Dana Point but slightly marred as you move south by rooftops of the homes immediately below our home. At 11.00 p.m. (June 13, 2006), while my wife was asleep, I observed from my second floor bedroom bay window, two extremely shiny objects next to each other. They were hover over the  ocean. However, it was impossible to tell how far from me the objects were because of the intensity of the lights. Each object had the same kind of lights; that is,  three very bright lights organized in a triangular shape. I observed these lights for about a minute or so until the lights of one object faded into darkness like the fade in a movie leading from one scene to the next; a minute or so later the other object&apos;s light&apos;s faded into darkness in the same way the lights of the first object faded. About 30 seconds thereafter, a new light came into view slightly to the west of where the lights of the other two objects faded. Then a second object appeared to the east of the lighted object and then a third light appeared. I immediately woke up my wife, and she observed the three lights. Within a few minutes, the lights of one object faded, then the lights of the second object faded and then the lights faded on the third object. The skyline was dark for about a minute then each object appeared again, about 30 seconds apart. At one point there was five objects (maybe six as I veiewed in a kind of mild astonishment. Three of the five objects appeared to be next to each other and the other two above the other three. I started to toy with the idea that the I was observing one object with different lighting sections. This was a distinct possibility but I can not be certain one way or the other. The whole situation lasted about twenty minutes. At no time was there significant movement of the lighted objects, but there was definitely slight movement. The objects stayed hovered in the same area with lights fading in an out. The fading of the lights did not suggest the object moved away at a fast speed. The lights were either turned off or  covered over by clouds. I would vote for turned off. But I can tell you this for absolute certain: the lights were very bright and they must have been observed by many people. I could find nothing in the newspapers about it.

But just before it got halfway across the sky it slowly began to turn N.E. and continued going N.E. and slowly got dimmer and dimmer until it reached about 10 degrees above the horizon and went out!

About 11:45 pm, I was able to leave my station and view the object.

A vague light at the front, much like an illuminated cockpit.  A white strobe light underneath was pulsing.  At what I considered to be the rear, a slightly larger constant light, not very bright, was the color of a slightly yellow moon.  Although there was nothing spectacular about what I was seeing, the most remarkable aspect of this sighting is that there was absolutely no motion or noise.  The object did not appear to hover because this would infer that it was making adjustments in horizontal and vertical attitude.  This object seemed to be set in the sky much the same as any radio tower or water tower light that you might observe.

Interestingly, the noise stayed at the same sound level regardless of how close the craft was.

It was at least as big or bigger than the U of A football stadium , which seats 50,000 people. it was totaly silent &amp; there was no sonic boom or exhaust trail. being only about an hour after dark in the tucson area, there must have been at least 100,000 people outside , not facing north who couldn&apos;t possibly have not seen it.  for the next two days I monitered the tv news, radio news &amp; newspaper looking for reports, but saw none whatsoever. I researched ball lighting &amp; found it couldn&apos;t be that. nothing in science explained what it could have been .   a year or two later the same phenomenon was reported over southern california, heading from southwest to the northeast toword  area 51. the one i saw was heading basically east to west slightly southeast to northwest.  a couple of years later I was watching a taped video lecture of a young german scientist giving a lecture about WWII Nazi UFO technology &amp; in it he spoke about a perticular sphereicle  craft  that would give the apperance of a giant ball of fire. that was the only thing i have ever heard that sounds like an explanation for what  me &amp; my friends saw. . thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I noticed one of the planes in the area begin descending sharply towards the object and realized it was one of a few military jets when it came closer.

The best description on size I could think of was that this craft was about the same size as a very high flying plane that you can just make out on an extremely clear day, maybe a plane at 30,000-40,000 feet or so.  In other words, a plane that you CAN completely make out, but is absolutely tiny as seen with the naked eye because its altitude is so high. With this said, it should be understood that I have been a plane fanatic since I was small child.  It should also be understood I enjoy looking for and watching night time satellites &amp; have easily seen 100 in my life.  (Out in the country on one night, I observed eight satellites in a 2-3 hour time period, I know what satellites look like).  I have grown up close to a major civilian airport, and also around a military airport.  I can easily estimate the altitude of just about any plane or helicopter with relative accuracy.  But with this object, I am having a real problem with even attempting to guess its altitude to an almost frustrating degree.  I do not understand this.  My best guess is that this object was at an altitude of 10,000 to 40,000 feet.  I am leaning toward roughly 30,000 feet.  I will say that I do not believe it was any lower than approximately 10,000 feet. I have no idea how large this circular craft was.  However, this craft looked remarkably similar to the craft seen in the videos that are repeatedly taped in Mexico.  I am speaking of the dozens of white (apparently circular) craft that fly together usually in formation, sometimes in, &quot;swarms.&quot;  The craft I saw looked like one of these craft, but at an apparently higher altitude and moving much faster than most of the videos I have seen of similar craft. I will say that this thing was really moving; it had to be going at least 4,000 mph or much faster depending on its altitude.  No sonic boom, no sound at all. I should add that I was wearing sunglasses.  The brand name of these sunglasses is, &quot;Costa Del Mar.&quot;  I paid about $140 dollars for these about seven years ago.  What distinguishes these sunglasses from the corner store sunglasses is the coating.  Without getting technical, these sunglasses make objects extremely vivid &amp; clear as compared to any other sunglasses I have ever owned or come across.  (These sunglasses are actually fisherman&rsquo;s sunglasses, although I do not fish).  When I first purchased them, I was amazed how vivid &amp; clear birds &amp; planes appeared.  My point is that, with the exceptionally clear weather, together with my 20/20 vision, and the added clarity of these sunglasses, I was able to determine this craft&rsquo;s shape. This object was not glowing white, no lights, no pulsing.  It was simply a clear, vivid white. Besides my inability to determine the objects altitude &amp; size, another odd characteristic was its movement.  I would not describe it as flying, but as gliding. This is simply my perspective. I do not believe this was a daytime satellite.  The reason I do not believe this was a satellite was that I could make out this craft&rsquo;s shape which was, although tiny, clearly round.  A second reason I do not believe this was a satellite was because this thing was moving faster than any object I have ever seen in my life; two to three times faster than any satellite.  With that said, and to be completely objective, I do not recall observing a day time satellite--only early morning or late evening satellites.  So if it was a day time satellite, why was it clearly round, and why was it moving so fast?  I am in my mid thirties, and have never seen a UFO in my life.  And it is not for lack of trying; I am constantly sky watching. I have no idea what this object may have been except a UFO.((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))Dear ((name and title deleted)), Thank you very much for the excellent report!  You seem to us to be an excellent witness, and you compose prose unusually well, which is something we observe here only rarely.Did the object generate a contrail, please?  Also, was its shape similar to any type of aircraft that you can imagine?  For example, if it had wings, were they swept back, or similar to a delta-winged aircraft, perhaps. Also, do you have any idea why the object faded from view?  It seems unusual that the object disappeared from view, given that you sighted it during daytime.  Thanks, again, for sharing the information with our Center, and for taking the time to compose such a nice report.  We will be posting newly received reports tomorrow, and yours will be among them. By the way, we just received two reports tonight, one from Texas, and one from Sacramento.  The TX sighting may have been of a satellite, but the CA sighting was of a totally dark, motionless, triangular craft, that reportedly was seen hovering above a busy intersection in Sacramento.  Many cars stopped, so that the occupants could get a better look at it. Cordially, Peter Davenport, DirectorNational UFO Reporting CenterSeattle, WAHotline:  (206) 722-3000 (8:00 a.m. to midnight)  ((END MESSAGE))((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))Thank you, I have a ((deleted--degree)) in ((deleted--writing)) although my regard for the media is abhorrent at best.No, absolutely no contrail whatsoever.  (And there were no contrails in the sky that I noticed as well).Its shape was not similar to any aircraft I have ever seen including the alleged Aurora.  I have been to a few air shows, and pride myself on distinguishing most military aircraft &amp; have done so since I was in 7th grade.No wings, no swept back wings like the F-14.  Not delta-winged.  This object was clearly circular in shape. Yes, I failed to answer this in my report &amp; knew while I was writing it that this was not clearly stated.  I do not know why it faded from my view.  Perhaps this object was much higher than 40,000 feet.  In layman&rsquo;s terms, if 12 O&rsquo;clock is straight up, I observed this object at about 12:30 and, &quot;lost&quot; it at about roughly 2 O&rsquo;clock.  It was moving.  Possibly it was in the atmosphere.  I just cannot answer this.  I will say that this object, this craft, was indeed difficult to see &amp; perhaps I just lost sight of it.  My best guess, and this is a guess, is that it was at 30,000 to 40,000 feet, a tiny 30 foot disc, and I just lost sight of it. You are welcome.  Thank you for all you have done. By the way, we just received two reports tonight, one from Texas, and one from Sacramento.  The TX sighting may have been of a satellite, but the CA sighting was of a totally dark, motionless, triangular craft, that reportedly was seen hovering above a busy intersection in Sacramento.  Many cars stopped, so that the occupants could get a better look at it. Ok, at about 10 pm to 10:15 pm, I was walking my dog &amp; listening to my ((deleted)) on my cell phone.  I looked up at the stars as I always do.  I noticed what appeared to be a bright star.  It caught my eye for just a second or two, I believe because it may have been moving, I am not sure, and I looked back down.  (Just a normal bright star).  I looked up maybe five seconds later and this, &quot;star,&quot; was gone and that really caught my attention.  So I carefully watched the sky roughly where this, &quot;star,&quot; had been, and then noticed a typical looking satellite, a satellite that has, &quot;dimmed,&quot; after not being lit up by the sun, but is clearly visible.  (It was traveling north).  I only saw this apparent satellite after it had, &quot;dimmed,&quot; for a couple of seconds before it clearly disappeared from my view.  This &quot;dimmed&quot; satellite moved at the speed as per normal for all satellites I have observed.  As I was still looking up at the sky, I then noticed a very dimly lit V-shaped formation of maybe 8 to 10, &quot;birds&quot; (?) moving north/north-east.  If these were birds, they kept one hell of a tight formation.  I lost these, &quot;birds&quot; within a few seconds.  I have NEVER seen anything that I considered could possibly be a UFO until I submitted my report.  I was literally typing the report when my ((deleted)) called &amp; ((deleted))  So I walked my dog.  The first object was probably a satellite, the second object very possible birds.  But the second object was simply odd because this formation was so tight and literally kept perfect formation.  It truly looked like the typical V-shaped formation that has so often been seen.  This was so weird that I could not bring myself to submit a second report--in the middle of my first UFO sighting/report of my life; I walk outside and see this.  But after the two sightings you mentioned I felt I should at least mention this.  Again, this is so odd, that I never would have mentioned this had you not mentioned these sightings.  Please understand this information is absolutely true, absolutely sincere, and not a joke in any form.  I do not know what else to say.Regards,((name deleted))((END RESPONSE))", "Silent wobbling disk with white-illuminated underside moving southwest above downtown ChicagoI was standing on my west-facing balcony on an upper floor of the east tower of the Marina City condo buildings in downtown Chicago (the famous &quot;corncob&quot;-shaped buildings), speaking to a friend on the phone.  My view is to the north and west with a 22-mile horizon view, broken by the ABA (former Quaker) building to the west. I looked absentmindedly to the northwest sky and noticed a small, silent, disk-shaped object flying steadily on a southwestern trajectory about a quarter of a mile away and about 600 feet above the ground (it was higher than my balcony and close, but moved behind the 600-foot tall ABA building while I watched it, giving me the opportunity to judge its height). The top and sides of the disk were completely dark, but the bottom surface was illuminated completely with a brilliant white light, as if a spotlight were shining on it from below.  The disk proceeded steadily in speed, but wobbled as it went, something like a top spinning slightly off its axis, so that every couple of seconds the illuminated underside rotated or leaned into view and then rotated away, but without the craft losing any forward momentum.  (The wobble in the disk looked a lot like the wobble you see in the various news videos of the disks from the daytime mass-event in Mexico a few years ago, which is what I immediately thought of as soon as I saw the object). After about 20 seconds the object moved behind the ABA building and I waited for about 30 seconds for it to reappear, which it did, much further away due to its southwest trajectory and still moving at the same speed and height.  After another ten seconds it disappeared from view completely behind Marina City&apos;s west tower. I was speechless throughout the incident, prompting my friend on the phone to ask what was wrong.  I explained everything I saw and spent several hours watching the skies from my apartment that night, but the object or another like it did not reappear. From my apartment, I see hundreds of planes flying to and from O&apos;Hare and flying along the flight path to Midway, as well as helicopters (traffic, police, etc.) all the time, every day and night.  I&apos;m very familiar with the airport flight paths and aircraft lighting schemes, as they&apos;re part of my nonstop view out of my windows and off of my balcony.  What I saw last night was like absolutely nothing I have ever seen flying over Chicago.", "For a long time I&apos;ve felt that you site has too many useless, brief and unspecific sightings.

Today I saw a new entry (occurrence 3/25/2006, reported 4/2/2006, shape circle lights, duration 2 minutes)from someone in Almherst NY which describes exactly the same thing I witnessed.  My posting information is as follows: Occurrence date:  5/6/1996 - Reported date  6/18/2005 - shape:  lights - Duration:  2 hours. I saw these lights, exactly the way described by this person.  The lights followed me all the way to Exit 63 on L.I. Expressway.  At one point they lost me somewhere around Deer Park and they followed a wrong car similar to my car.  I proceeded to exit 63 and then when I came back to get on LIE, I saw them again, waiting for me.  They again followed me all the way to exit 41 N. Oysterbay.  At that point I pulled to service road and stopped.  They stopped toO.  We (me, my husband &amp; 3 children) hangout there for about 15 minutes, they stayed too.  Then I took Rt. 106 going up north.  they came north with me for about couple of miles until the sky ran out of clouds and there is where they stopped.  They waited a while and when the distance became too far (but I still could see them in the sky), then they went back to LIE and proceeded going toward City.  The strange part is that when I saw the lights the first time I was coming from city on LIE, it was around Elmherst area near those gas tanks and they saw me too and started following me.  If you want to read my full report, go by posted date or occurenace date, I am not sure, and look for category light. Until today, I have been trying to explain this logically to myself(earthwise logically that is) and I could not come up with any answers.  I don&apos;t think the lights were coming from any solid objects such a flying spaceship or else, but I believe we are being scanned by other beings in the universe.  They may not be able to come here for distance&apos;s sake but they can send their intelligent lights to monitor us and they can control their lights from where ever they are.  It freaks me out to say this but I think they can see us too otherwise how could they find me again.

I witnessed at least one craft silver/grey in color, very reflective.  I cannot give an estimate of the altitude of the craft in question.  It flew across the sky from E to S.  At a point around SE it disappeared from the sky.  It had not changed direction or speed.  I did not take my eyes off the object.  Upon scanning the sky, I discovered the object in question back at the original place in the sky at compass E.  Around this time of that year, I witnessed several craft having the same characteristics both in behavior and appearance. The most notable sighting of these craft occurred around this time as well.  I saw one of these craft while in the backyard of my house.  The cigar-shaped craft crossed the sky, then stopped in mid-air.  A blue light came off of it, shining brightly even in mid-afternoon.  I don&apos;t recall exactly what happened that day, other than two odd things that I cannot account for.  One: I seem to have blacked out, but I came out of it standing upright in a different part of the yard than where I was when I saw the light.  Two: My clothes seemed in dissarray, my shirt was on inside-out and my pants&apos; zipper was down. I have since then had a dream about that day.  I do not consider the dream to be 100% reliable.  It may be the actual events of that day or merely my imagination.  However, the dream started out exactly like my real memories of that day.  In my dream I see the craft come down and hover over my house.  The next scene is me sitting naked in a white room with sophisticated equipment on my right and 2-3 &quot;greys&quot; in front of me.  There is a being to my immediate right holding an instrument in his hands and he moves behind me and I feel a pain behind my right ear.  Since that day, I have a noticeable lump behind my ear.  I have not had it taken out or seriously evaluated by a medical professional.

I was unable to see the exact shape, but for an instant I saw it hover over some trees, then all of the suddeb it dissapears and I see a slight &quot;light trail&quot; that it left behind and it soon dissapeared as well.  About 2 minutes later I saw it again, floating over a hill, above some trees.  It also dissapeared and left the same light trail.

Higher than a Skywriiting plane!  Each occurence has been against a crystal-clear bluesky backdrop.  You can make out that the object seems to rotate in place; the sun can been seen glinting off the object as it rotates.  With the naked eye, it appears to be oval; but in the picuture I canptured, zoomed in to 1600%, the object seems to be triangular.Each time I would call out my wife to confirm what I was seeing; she could immediately see the object, on both occasions, and it looked to be the same object, in about the same  location in the sky.I also noted commercial airliners, high flying birds (gulls) and even the Moon; these all  help reference how high the object was.

Eventually I noticed a bright light, which changed in intensity a bit, but did not appear to have any noticeable shape.  It approached the aircraft at slight angle, coming up from behind it on what looked like an intercepting at a greater but steady velocity.After about a minute, a small contrail curled off the opposite side of the aircraft, and travelling much faster than the craft itself, curled around the front of the aircraft and headeded toward the light.  When the small contrail had quickly closed half the distance to the light, the light instantaneously changed speed and direction to a course five times as fast as it had been moving and almost 90 in a different direction.

I even submitted photos last year that showed objects in front of me and around me while driving from Texas to California.  Needless to say I have had a few sightings. What brought me to write today was that I noticed a few reports from the 1977-78 period of pretty much what I saw myself in the city of Whittier.  I am in my late 30&apos;s now and at the time I was in 6th grade.. The time was close to 4pm because my friend&apos;s mom was the manager of a donut shop and we would go pig out there everyday after school. We got to the corner of Lambert &amp; Colima when one of the kids yelled &quot;hey look a rocket&quot;!. We looked up towards the Hacienda Hts area.  There is a big hill you have to go over that leads into Hacienda Heights using Colima Rd.  We saw the object in plain sight but at first all we could see was a flame coming out of something.  It was right above Colima Rd at the top of the hill.  That is a major pathway for planes coming into LAX.  They come in every few minutes so someone had to have seen something. We continued watching the object and then it started to move high into the sky but towards our direction and settling directly above.  As it got above our heads (several thousand feet in the air), I could see it perfectly, it was a huge  Triangle with different colored blinking lights on the side (specifically blue &amp; red), a flame coming out of the back, and a bright white light at the tip. It stayed up there for at least 2 hours.  Didn&apos;t move. The time was now way after 5pm and it started to get dark. The triangle was now blending in perfectly with the stars.  I remember still faintly being able to see the red/orange flame coming out the back and not really being able to see the red &amp; blue lights on the sides anymore.  My neck was hurting so badly from looking straight up for all that time that I finally had to take a few minuets rest.  When I looked back up I couldn&apos;t find it but all the kids were saying &quot;it&apos;s right there&quot; and pointing it out to me..Well I just couldn&apos;t find it anymore because it just blended in with the stars so well. I ran home to tell my family but who would believe a young kid saying such a story.  I mean, if it were that big, flying in LAX air traffic space, in plain sight, then why was there no news covereage or any mention of it?? Well I never did hear anything about it but I know what I saw. It is fresh in my memory to this day as if it just happened yesterday.  Who knows maybe since we were kids, the er uh &quot;visitors&quot; only allowed us to see them.  But whatever it was, it was huge, it was close, and it was real.  I would also like to add that a few years later (early 80&apos;s) I was watching a UFO documentary and they told the story of a man in either Wyoming or Montana that shot at a UFO that was chasing him.  Well guess what?  He drew the exact same thing I saw that day.  The triangle, flame coming out the back, bright white light at the tip, and different colored lights on the side.  I got excited and called my brother to come watch and asked him if he remembered the UFO story I told him about a few years back, I said &quot;that&apos;s exactly what I saw&quot;.  He just basically said &quot;are you sure&quot; and I said &quot;I&apos;m positive&quot; (to which he replied &quot;what a trip&quot;).  I guess I got so excited because someone other than the group of kids and myself actually had an encounter with this thing and drew it in all exactness of what I saw that day.. I read about the enormous Chevron craft seen by a woman over the 605 fwy that same time period as well as another story relating to the same info and I knew I had to include my experience as well.  The area over Colima Rd is a sort of UFO hotspot. In 1998 after leaving a friend&apos;s house just before midnight, I drove up Colima Rd coming from Hacienda to Whiiter, and as I neared the top of the hill a White light just shot across in front of me. I sped up to try and get another look but it was long gone.  It was just like a Blip but I saw it and it was not a reflection from any other lights because for those who know that hilltop, there is a small area where there are no street lights, that&apos;s where it flew across.  I feel relieved in a sense to hear that other people have come across what I saw that day back in the late 70&apos;s.  Although I know what I saw, it&apos;s just so relieving to know that I wasn&apos;t alone and that others came across some big, weird stuff they can&apos;t explain either.  I gotta tell you, seeing something like that is better than getting your first bicycle on Christmas - it really is.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I saw a big bright light. it looked really round.  the light stood there or seemed to be still for about 5 minutes. then i saw it descend as if it were falling. it stopped decending then started coming our way which was south of it&apos;s location. my son and i made a fuss over this light and became concerened as it started getting closer to us, we noticed it was right over us in less than 2 minutes.  I cannot explain the length of time that we stared at this scary thing in the sky, time seemed to pass forward and we didnt realize what had happen to us for about 2 1/2  hours. it was after 1:20 am when we cought ourselves screaming and running into the house and the 3 other kids ages vary from 9 to 14 yrs of age did not see a thing nor did they understand why my 15 yr old son and I were running frantically from the park.  only that we were five total and it only attracted 2 of us. please anyone, if this same thing happen to you please let us all know.  This is what my son and I saw that night. I do hereby swear and promise on the holy bible in the presence of our lord as our whitness that this is the truth and the whole truth as best remembered so help us God.   In the sky above us this night, we saw a huge pitch black triange with dull soft lighting coming from the 2 back corners of the craft as though it were lit up slightly from the inside.and maybe light was visable through a dim window or glass. it had  a red light that glowed from the bottom center but not bright, it was more like a red light like from heat that&apos;s generated.. like how hot coals would glow. I could see well because the craft had descended so low that I could hear it and I could see something undernieth the belly. like markings. it was not a stealth bomber nor did it have any other shape other than a perfect triangle. it was very still for the most part. long enough for me to notice the sound that it made.  the height it hovered was no more than the tallest street lights in a city. it seemed to be as wide as maybe a football field. it was very  still and very quiet. my son and I froze with fear and ran away leaving my kids at the park. when i realize what i had done i ran back to the park and it was still there hovering over the park and that&apos;s when i noticed the strange lines under the craft. it seem to have markings like a map. they were black or very dark or smokey grey. and barely visable. the craft did make a sound. it was a whispering soft humming unlike anything i heard. my ac makes more noise than the craft did. i would say the sound was similar to that of a brand new computer that hums perfectly with just a slight bit of air flowing through it. the scary thing is that we were so close to it and only 2 of us saw it, what I dont get is we get to the park around 11:05pm no later that for sure. but cannot remeber why it took us almost 3 hours to run home! our home was only 2 houses away, less than 1 minute down the sidewalk. when we ran away we saw it take off slowly to the south west towarsd phx. I watched it for 2 minutes then it simply vanished. most of all we cannot explain the loss of time and why only 2 of us saw this triangle in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

From SW direction appeared 4 &quot;fireballs,&quot; or circular/spherical shaped lights of orange/ gold. They were all the same size(about 4 times the size of large visible planet) and moving at the same speed (slower than low airplane) in a loosely formed line. They were about 1/2 to 3/4 less bright than an airplane headlight, but soft and diffused, almost fuzzy at edges. They were not flashing but barely pulsating with no pattern, and there was no sound. We really had no sense of how far away they were or how big, it was impossible to distinguish. They were heading NE then took a wide turn towards SE. They appeared to be directly over downtown area. After their turn they slowed to a stop, and stayed without moving for a few minutes, then they slowly began to get smaller/ fade. They still were not moving, unless exactly away from us (I lined them up with a building to check for motion. One dissapeared quicker then the others, and before the others did also, two more lights, exactly the same size, color shape, speed, appeared from the SE in the exact spot as the first group, and continued along the same &quot;path&quot; and dissapeared where the others had.

I quickly ran back inside and grabbed another employee to come look. When we came back out, the object had stopped in the air about a mile from our location.

On this day was overcast with storms in the area, but it never rained where I was.  My coworkers and I were always watching the sky to see if there was a rainshower near by.  At about 15:00hrs I spotted an object in the distant sky which I thought was a helicopter approaching to a landing strip about a mile away from my location.  I noticed that the speed at which the object was approaching was very slow and I proceeded to ask my two other coworkers their opinion of what the object was.  The responses they gave me (a hawk, a baloon, a kite, a blimp) were slowly being eliminated as the object moved closer to our location in Harlingen, Tx.  The best description that I can give about the object is as follows.  It was black in color and had a triangular shape.  At one point in my observation, it seemed as if it was a convetional private jet airplane that was out of control because it had a faint sound of a jet engine and was rotating as it made its approach.  As it moved closer, I began to notice a disturbance that encompassed the object; a light orange colored aura.  It also left a trail of disturbed air also tinted in orange which demonstrated its movement.  At it&apos;s closest point, five other coworkers joined me in the observation of the object.  the object was approaching from the ESE and took a turn to the WSW and began moving away from my location at almost the same speed as the approach.", "I first noticed it coming from the southern sky heading north. It appeared to be over the eastern portion of Clifton when I saw it then getting the attention of my girlfriend at the time and my son, 17 I believe, at the time, all of us stood fixated on this very different looking object.  Different because I&apos;ve never seen anything shaped like this in any of the images put forth on any media. Basically and simplistically, it appeared to look like a drifting, bright, shiney steel garbage can. I&apos;m not trying to be funny. It seemed to be traveling I would say about 30 miles an hour approximately a half mile or so from our point of view. With the sun&apos;s reflection it&apos;s top appeared either had a series of brilliant lites or these were reflections. Vertical indents going around the side is what made it appear as I&apos;ve said, a garbage can and what would have been the lid may have been for observation. With the distance, it&apos;s size, and sun reflection I could not make out much more. I dubbed it the &quot;flying garbage can&quot; because that was exactly what if appeared to be but of course we all know they have no system of propulsion. At the speed this was going it definitely seemed to defy gravity. We watched it head toward the city of Paterson, NJ and at a point where we might have thought it lowered it&apos;s altitude large trees then blocked our view altogether. We were quite dissappointed. So that&apos;s it in a nutshell - I/we will not forget that one; there was a long time when any of us went outside we always looked for our &quot;floating garbage can&quot;.......it certainly was unique.......((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

What troubles me the most is the first time I saw the alien was at a very young age on my way home from school.  But the siting was while myself and two friends were on our way from elmira up the road through elm hghts to purchase beer.  I was 18 at the time and I am currently 48 years old. Anyway, as heading down the road(Iwasin the back seat leaning between the buckets) and this light in the sky was coming right towards us as if it were following the road. We immediately pulled over and got out of the car, there it was hovering above (bout 15 feet above) the telephone pole.  It zigged zagged acrossed the sky east to west 3 or 4 times like it was showing off or something. Then headed up the road the same direction we were going to travel.  As you probably can imagine we were yelling and screaming like three girls. ((deleted))  and the like. As it traveled up the road it was like it wanted us to follow it cause the speed of this was never seen on this earth.  After about 1/4 mile we were at the Chemung County Fair grounds where we pulled over again and it hovered over us and just kinda like it was taunting us. My two friends stayed next to the car (as I recall)  I went into the road and was screaming to cars passing &quot;stop stop look up look up&quot;  people just looked at me like nothing was happening. This haunts me to this day cause I know they&apos;ll be back again soon it has been a while since the last time.  We went directly to the police dept in Horseheads to report this and the officer said &quot;go home and sleep it off boys&quot;. I wanted so bad to get some kind of evidence I called the local airport which is 10 minutes away and asked for the tower.  They said because of the low altitude they could not verify anything on radar.  It continued to fly over the tree tops then we lost site of it. The second part that is most troubling to me is a few years later I ask the one guy I was with &quot; hey remember when?&quot;  He had no recollection of the event even happening, this really really disturbs me.  I know I wasnt dreaming and I know we got that ((deleted)) beer after that had happened. I was ready to get lit then.  I havent spoke to the third party in this event cause I was afraid too after what already occurred.  BTW_ NONE of the ((deleted)) pics match the craft &quot;WE&quot; saw.And the ((deleted)) aliens arent little gray men cause the ones that have visited me are 5 1/5 to 6 feet tall and are flatt black with no whites in thier eyes.  The one time they visited me I was able to take my right hand and pinch my left arm sooo hard there was a black and blue mark when I awoke.  I couldnt open my eyes or move anything else......no otherdrugs involved here.sooo those that don&apos;t believe will be the most surprised..((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.

We could not see the craft from where we were standing. At first we were scared and then about 20 minutes later, when nothing happened, we decided to &quot;live and let live&quot; and went on searching for bottles.  About an hour and half later we heard three electronic beeps from the other side of the hill.  It was then we decided to leave.

The night sky was completely clear and no clouds were in the air so I could see the object of light quite clearly. The light moved too fast to be an airplane, produced no sound, was at a hight of about 200 feet or 300 feet, and seemed to have a small haze around it. At first it was on a southwest trajectory, but then changed immediately to a west north west trajectory. At first I thought I just was seeing things or got too much of a buzz off my cigarette. However, after talking with my friends for another 5 minutes I decided to look in the sky where I saw the object. After watching for about 45 seconds I witnessed 3 more lights move across the same area of the sky in a southeast trajectory in formation. Startled I let two of my friends know what I had seen. We decided to go to the backyard where there was less light and trees to see if we could all see the objects I witnessed. After being outside for about 2 minutes laying down on a blanket we witnessed four objects move from the west part of the sky to the eastern part only to disappear over the city of Natchitoches, Louisiana.

I live in a community southwest of Portland, Oregon.  While I was outside looking at the night sky my attention was drawn to an object just NE of my zenith near the head of Ursa Major.  The object was very faint, nearly transparent but certainly had some form.  It was difficuly for me to judge it&apos;s size but I estimate that it was approximately 1 degree of arc.  It&apos;s shape was either rectangular or oval. The object being very faint, it was my impression that it was purposely difficult to see.  Without it&apos;s movement, I may not have seen it at all.  But once &quot;locked on&quot;  I was able to follow it.  The object was mostly black either because it was transparent against the dark sky or made of a dark material.  I&apos;m not sure which.  But it did have a very subtle green and red glow. The object moved in a straight line from Ursa Major due east past the &quot;guardians&quot; made a quick jog to the north and resumed an easterly course.

On the day I listed 4/22 in the morning I was asleep and woke up hearing a weird &quot;twirling&quot; which had a 3-4 different type of tones like noise, which seemed to be coming from my backyard/backwindow, and just &quot;hovering out gavk.  Still somewhat in a sleep mode and as i was becoming more alert to the noise. I sat up and looked in the direction of my back windows where i was hearing the noise, and saying to myself, &quot;what the hell is that?&quot; by now I was somewhat fully awake to notice that this is not a normal noise and as I got up to go check it out, my two cats were both under the drapes looking out the window, One hissed and the other one ran to the sliding door to the deck. As I got closure to the window the  noise start to fade and then it stopped by the time I got to the window. I looked out and saw nothing, went out to the deck and looked around for anything odd, looked up in the sky for an aircraft and saw nothing. I own a house in a suburb and the sky was clear and I didn&apos;t see any &quot;blinking light&quot; from an aircraft/helicopter/ that they would have, the noise was so different from any type of noice that I ever heard from any aircraft. So at that time I decided to go back to bed. Waking up later, the sound still in my head, I was so sure that the noice was in my backyard that when I was finally up and about I went out my bsck yard and looked around for any thing that would be able to make that twirling noise.I found nothing of course, but the moise was so odd and so weird that it has not left my mind still to this day.You may conatct me and if not no biggie likes I said iin the begining, it was a noise..realy weird though.", "2 different ships 2 different daysWas driving down 459 heading east with my girlfriend and was watching this light in the distance. Didn&apos;t look like anything I have seen before. I started to slow down on the interstate to get a better look and it was getting closer. As it passed over head around 500 feet above I pulled over the car. I couldn&apos;t really see the shape of the object other than the light formations underneath. The lights were in a plus formation with 7 white lights total. The light were a dome shape (kinda like one of those battery dome push lights.) Being around 500 feet above me I would say that each dome was as least 6 feet in diameter. I rolled down my window to see if I could hear anything and it was dead silent. The ship was moving probably around 5 miles an hour. Maybe even slower. Saying I could have ran across the interstate about the same speed as it was traveling. The ship was heading toward Bessemer.Two days later I was in hueytown and for about 5 sec saw another ship that was a diamond shape color bright blue under the diamond there was a U cut out shape. Was moving east to west very fast and very straight. Was almost like the U shape underneath the ship was traveling on an invisible rail. The color of the ship was changing from red, yellow only on the bottom U part. The rest of the ship was bright blue. Had 5 people see this ship. One was a church lady and just could not believe her eyes.", "Bright white light in rural area of Memphis in 1976 responds to kid&apos;s and their sealed beam flashlight.Myself, two friends and the mother of one of those friends witnessed in the summer of 1976 an unusually bright, white light moving extremely slow from south to north just above the trees and it seemed to be moving parallel to a fairly new street that ran through our neighborhood.It had just become dark (around 9 pm, the time we had to be back in our parent&apos;s sight)and my friends and I had begun settling down for the night on the front porch and were repairing our bicycles after a long hard day of BMXing and Evel Keneveling.We had our bicycles under extreme maintenance and one of us lost a small part in the shrubbery around the porch. One friend went down two doors to his home and returned with a 12 volt sealed beam lantern. We were looking for the part for several minutes and then found it. As I got up and walked out on the sidewalk in front of the house, I looked to the east and noticed this bright light hanging in the sky just behind the very top of a tree. I said nothing and went back to my mechanic duties when my friend noticed it a few seconds later. She asked if that was the police helicopter that had frequented our neighborhood on regular patrol during the summers. (We would run out in the street and wave at the pilots and they would blink the carbon-arc spot at us to say hello. Those were the days...). Curiously I looked again to see if that was the same light I had noticed a few seconds earlier and it was. I said that if that were the helicopter, we would here it as close as it was like we always did.My other friend, with sealed beam flashlight still in hand, turned it on and shined it on the &quot;object&quot; through the tree top. I told him I didn&apos;t think that was a good idea, but he being a year older (15), over rode that idea and did it anyway.  At this point the &quot;object&quot; slowly moved out from behind the tree top as if to get a better look at us or our light source and just hung there quietly. He turned off his light, and about 2 seconds later the &quot;object&quot; began to move and he shined his light on it again and it stopped. I excitedly told my other friend to get our parents and she ran in and only returned with her mother. She saw the &quot;object&quot; and assured us it was an airplane or our helicopter friends until we questioned her as to where the moving BEAM of blue-white light was and pointed out that the white light was WAY too bright for normal running lights on an airplane, it was WAY too low to be an aircraft of any kind without making noise or kicking up dust. It was not until my older friend  said, &quot;...and watch this.&quot; as he shined his light on it again and it began to slowly move (east) our way that she was convinced and noticeably shaken when he turned off the light and the &quot;object&quot; stopped! Here she nervously ordered us all in the house (mine being the closest)and to my parents surprise who thought were playing jokes. She also told them something strange was low in the sky and relatively close but they, still showing no interest chose not to investigate. We all four returned to the porch expecting it to be gone saw it still quietly hanging in the sky right where we left it. We studied it for about 30 seconds when it began to move north. My older friend again shined his bright flashlight toward the &quot;object&quot; and it stopped once again. We were all beginning to become concerned at this time when it began to resume it&apos;s northward course along a north-south street but slowly gaining altitude until it got to which is now by my estimation, 50-60 feet above the rooftops. My older friend tried to chase it on his bicycle for a closer look and my other friend and I scaled a brick swimming pool fence and stood atop it to get a better look as it flew off over the neighborhood and sped out of sight within 1 or 2 seconds and disappearing after making an extremely sharp turn to the west.My friend&apos;s mother then used our phone to call Memphis International tower to see if anything was flying around our area. After what seemed to me to be about 15 minutes on the phone with them they said they could find nothing unusual. She retold these events to my parents as we kids returned to the front porch hoping it would come back but as far as I know, none of us ever spoke of this event again among ourselves or to anyone else. I&apos;m just wondering if I am the only one that remembers this now....((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "The UFO hovered over house, hurt me and flew awayFrom my primary angle of view it was a thick large disk shaped craft with a large rotating dome on top and four equally spaced domes of a smaller sort underneath. It glowed an intense white glow that enveloped the whole ship. I could only see details better when I had my sunglasses on. It had a diameter of 6 city buses. When I looked closely at the rotating dome I saw strange runes or glyphs encircling the top dome emitting a blue glow that out lined these odd symbols. It went the same for the smaller rotating domes underneath, yet they were colored separately purple, red, green, and yellow. It circled around my house practically brushing the tree tops. After about 15 minutes of circling it hovered directly over the house. Intrigued, I went outside to get a better view of it. The glyphs on the small domes then became brighter and the domes began to spin faster and faster. Then all of the sudden a dazzling blast of light focused on me. I was so scared I couldn&apos;t move. Then something very crazy happened. All of the sudden there was a horrible shrieking noise inside my head. It was deafening and incredibly painful and forced me to the ground clutching my throbbing head as though I was to die from it. Then there was a brilliant blaze of light and the shrieking stopped. The ship then began a steady climb towards the stars. As it did, four orbs about the size of a car appeared to have risen out of the forest and began circling in bizarre patterns around the ship. The craft rose faster and faster into the night sky, till it was only a speck in the sky a roared of at an incredible speed. Battered and reeling from the encounter and the intense pain that still clawed my brain.

On this Saturday afternoon, I was running some errands with my 4 year old son, driving east on Old Hwy 94, when I looked to the north and saw a vertical white cylinder cruising from west to east.  It appeared to be about 3/4 of a mile away and at about 2000-2500 feet above ground.  Its proportions were about 1 to 5, so I guess it was about 6&apos; wide by 30&apos; tall. It was moving steadily at a speed equal to or greater than that of a twin engine propeller-driven airplane, so I would guess 150-200 mph.  I worked my way through an intersection and then pulled to a stop in a parking lot for a better look.  This thing cruised and then quickly slowed to a complete stop, where it hovered for maybe 10 seconds, then traveled straight up at about half it&apos;s previous speed for about 1000 feet, then stopped and hovered for maybe 30 seconds, then began accelerating to the east again at 150-200 mph.  I watched its departure until it went out of sight.  It remained very bright white the whole time, and as it moved, it never looked thinner or flashed brightly as if it had edges, so I think it was a cylinder.  The sky was sunny with a broken ceiling of alto-cumulus clouds, with moderate winds out of the west. The object remained below the clouds.  The object was traveling with the wind, but maneuvering unlike a balloon or anything else.  I continued with my errands, constantly looking up to the sky as I drove around town.  After a few minutes, I stopped at a Sonic drive-in for lunch and parked so that I could look to the north-west.  I began eating my lunch while looking up through the windshield, and was rewarded almost immediately (this was 20 minutes later)when I saw a dark round object flying from west to east.  I got out of the car for a better look and saw as it was approaching and then passing almost directly above, that it was round when viewed from below and a flattened oval when viewed from the side.  It was shaped just like a glass piece from the game &quot;Pente&quot;.  This object was bronze-colored (a dark blend of green, brown and gold).  As it made distance, I could see that the top was highly refective of the sun.  I wanted to rule it out as a toy balloon, but it wasn&apos;t.  As it traveled, I gained a sense of its approximate height and distance and surmised it was not small and low to the ground, but higher, larger and faster.  It wobbled as it flew; listing 20-30 degrees but never flipping end over end.  I would guess it was at about 1000&apos; above ground and maybe 8&apos;-12&apos; in diameter.  I later called the St. Louis FAA Fight Service Station which offers detailed weather conditions for pilots.  The briefer told me that at that time the cloud ceiling was at or above 5000&apos; above ground, the winds aloft at 3000&apos; were at 18 knots (approx. 20 mph) from the west.  This told me that although both objects were traveling with the wind, they were cruising on their own power 8 to 10 times faster than the wind could push them.  I feel lucky to have seen these things, but returned to the family reunion not saying a damn word about it.  I&apos;ll tell my son about it when he&apos;s older and will look up to the skies a lot more often.

They were almost directly over the road (or, if further out than they appeared, over the Sonoran Desert Natl. Monument), though how far in the distance and at what altitude I don&rsquo;t know.  Twilight had almost completely faded.  They were not there more than ten seconds before all the orbs disappeared at the exact same time as though someone had quickly turned down a dimmer switch to &lsquo;off&rsquo;.Less than ten minutes later another set of lights - same color but elongated in shape and more tightly grouped/farther off - appeared in succession to the Southwest of 347 and quickly disappeared in the same order.  Each would come on and soon fade out as its neighbor within the cluster followed suite.  We followed 347 and then 84 west to the I8 and headed South then East, seeing them further away to the SW yet again on two more occasions for no more than 6 seconds at a time, probably over the Barry M.

We turned south down Stanfield Rd., eventually heading into Tohono Indian Reservation (and seeing another quick, stationary-yet fade-in/fade-out series of amber lights directly in front of us, to the south) before turning around.  As we headed back north, the series appeared again (around 8:30pm), this time to our South West, perhaps back over the Goldwater Range.

There, about 200ft up was a glowing orb i wondered what it was and for a second i thought it was just a very bright moon but then i noticed it move slightly. i thought it was just a trick of the mind but then it started zig-zaging everywere at tramendous speed. then it would stop and hover in a different place and then a few seconds later begin another set of zig-zags. i also found that when it moved the whiseling soind got louder and more high pitched. it kept doing this so i dashed for the camera and just started taking pictures non stop. unfortunataly i was in so mutch shock i was too busy staring at the object than taking pictures of it so on allot of the pictures i didnt catch the object at all and due to the immense speed it was traveling at, it was hard to catch it while it was moving so allot of the half decent images are when its hovering, although i cought a few with it doing its manuvors. you can see the speed on the pictues because it leaves a streak were it has been traveling and the camera wasnt on a long shutter speed or anything like that. it did this for about 5 minutes, maybe less and then shot off towards the south.i stayed at the window for a few minites after to see if it would return but it didnt. after i leaft the window i kept lisening out for a whisle and although i didnt hear it again i did hear what sounded like a fighter jet going over a verry high speed about 10 minutes after the incident. im not saying it was going after the object but im no were near a military air field and i dont think ive ever heard them in the area before.", "Witnessed 2 sets of lights in the sky first around 9pm above my fiance&apos;s work while on my way to pick him up. One was triangle shaped and the other cyllinder. I only glimpsed these a moment before the lights faded out.

I picked my fiance up and we headed home. about 1 1/2 miles from my fiance&apos;s work on the same road the same set of lights again appeared behind us and I pointed them out to my fiance. My 2 children also in the car turned around and also saw them. This time they were over a baseball field and lasted about 45-55 seconds before fading out. We all agreed they couldn&apos;t be flares or fire, the shape was too perfect and didn&apos;t shift at all while we watched.

We took a break and my friend pointed out that there was a large red oval shape in the sky. I looked at it and he was right. I scanned the sky and saw two more.

All of a sudden a very bright light like a fireball started going down,very fast like in free fall. My first thought that came to my mind was the Lockerbie disaster that happened almost 20 years ago. It kept on falling and falling and came closer;we thought it would crash at the city across Tyne river called Gateshead. All of a sudden it freezes;my girlfriend and I froze too.The &quot;object&quot; then started moving horizontally and all of a sudden it dissapeared. What made me think that this was not a plane were two facts: 1) the plane was glowing like a fireball;no green or red lights spotted as in commercial jets 2) no sound of engines;surely the pilots would have tried to pick it up while it was in free fall.3) I live near the airport and planes here in newcastle do not take off after midnight.4)The fact that it completely stopped in the air for 1 second.  It was dark so as you can understand something glowing liek a fireball in the sky could make it easier to track such an object but difficult to tell its shape or form.After so many days we kept telling friends of what we saw and most of them are iffy on the subject but firmly believe us.

I was traveling north on Hwy 431 on my way from Dothan, AL to Atlanta to visit a friend before Christmas.  Just outside Headland I saw a very large, very bright white light directly overhead.  For lack of a better description, it was like a strobe light but was not flashing.  It was constant and as I got closer it was so bright that it was painful to look at it (I was trying to see exactly where it was coming from). It was a clear, cool evening with no cloud cover and there were no street lights, businesses or billboard advertising signs in the immediate area (my first guesses).  I slowed down to about 10 mph and looked for something that would give me some idea of what it was (I was afraid to stop and get out of the car).  I saw what appeared to be the an outline of dark metal (black or dark gray) several yards forward of the light which was still bright and non-flashing.  I opened all of the windows on my SUV and heard no sound other than my vehicle&apos;s engine. The &quot;object&quot; appeared to be approximately 100 feet above the highway and must have been huge as I was never able to see anything more than the outline on one side.  My guess is that it was either triangular or chevron in shape and appeared to be moving south very slowly.  There were no other lights besides the white one.  I observed this &quot;object&quot; for approximately 15 minutes before I decided to continue heading north and watched it in my rear view mirror, until it was just a faint glow. I was almost 40 at the time and have never seen anything like this in my life. I like to believe there is a logical explanation for just about everything but have not been able to explain this one.  When I came home a couple days later I asked around to see if there had been anything on the local news or in the paper about anything strange that weekend and nobody had heard anything. I would have reported this immediately but had no idea where to go that I wouldn&apos;t be thought of as &quot;nuts&quot;.

Since this occurred so many years ago, the actual year could have been 1954 or might have even been 1956.  In any case, I was 8 or 9 years old at the time. Around 1:00 A.M. in the morning, I had to get up and use the bathroom.  I know it was around 1:00 A.M. because our clock struck the hour before I went back out onto the front porch. As I was settling back down to go to sleep, I heard what could be likened to the sound of an 18 wheeler when it shifts down to a lower gear, and there was also a hissing sound like steam. I sat up and since I thought it was a truck coming down our little side road, I wanted to see that unusual sight. Imagine my shock when instead of a truck, there in the sky was a fireball.  It was skimming along just above the trees lining a creek on the other side of the road.  It made a sharp right angle turn, and after it moved off perhaps 75 feet or so, it looked like it was dripping something flammable from beneath it. Suddenly it stopped.  And just as I thought to myself....&quot;uh oh, they see me&quot;.... The next thing I remember is sitting on the front porch, and somehow the craft had already moved off some distance.  I tried to wake up my sister, but by the time I got her to wake up, it was out of sight. The strange thing about this whole ordeal, was that it was already beginning to get light outside when I watched this craft move off.  I went from 1:00 A.M. to daylight without any memory. I told my mom about what happened, and she only suggested that I not tell anyone about what had occurred...and I haven&apos;t until now. I am now married, retired, and no longer live in Missouri, and I don&apos;t see where this information is going to hurt anyone; and perhaps someone will find it useful or interesting.

They were flying in formation roughly 200 ft above sea level.  This struck me as odd because military aircraft rarely flew anywhere near the area, so I stopped to see what was going on.  Roughly 20 seconds later, a white, diamond-shaped craft flew overhead, roughly 100 feet above sea level -- much lower than the helicopters.  It made no sound and no colors other than white were seen.  It was fairly bright, but not so bright as to light the ground beneath.  There were also no navigational lights.  It was very large, with the sides spanning about 30 degrees of sky from my perspective.  Total viewing time was 6-8 seconds.  After it passed out of sight behind me, another 3 seconds or so passed when two F-4s (recognized by the sound) came screaming along the same path.  These passed by about the same altitude of the helicopters, roughly 200 ft.  They were moving very fast, as if they were moving to intercept.

It was a clear night with out wind, and at the point I was out there it was also very quiet.  Our apartment complex consist of 7 builings that form a circle.

I was on a training flight tonight with my instructor just having entered Orlando&rsquo;s airspace (we were about 15 miles due west of KMCO and just inside their class bravo airspace, when we saw several multicolored flashing lights about 10 miles off the noise of our aircraft. We Both asked each what the heck is that, the object just hovered at about 4000 ft for about 15 seconds then turned away from us(the lights resembled that of aircraft turning) so I assumed it turned, and within .5 of a second the object warped out I mean It literally went from a hover to light speed we watched as it disappeared (basically the lights just got smaller till it finally disappeared into space.  It is important to note this object went from a hover to out of sight in .5 of a second.  At which point it did that my instructor and me just looked at each other like did you just see that?  I then contacted Orlando approach to ask if there had been any aircraft off our 12 o clock within 20 miles within the past 2 minutes and they replied no we haven&rsquo;t had anyone on radar.  Obviously this was some sort of stealth aircraft (ufo).  Since I&rsquo;ve been flying I have never seen anything like this and thought that it would be worth noting", "DEC 1965  NEWTOWN SQUARE PENN   FLAMING BURNING OBJECT   MOVING ACROSS THE SKY VERY LOW AND SLOWI am 56 years of age and currently live in southwest arizona where I moved to some 27 years ago.  In the year 1965 I was living in southeastern Pennsylvania in a small suburb town 35 miles west of Philadelphia called Newtown square,  in those days i had taken a part time job after school in a new music store,  i got done work about 5 pm  , i was standing on a small stone wall outside the store waiting for my mother to pick me up.   i remember  i was facing east  when over my  right shoulder i heard  what seemed to be that of a jet engine or a very roaring fire overhead,  when i looked up  i saw a large very low flaming object  moving  in a northwesterly direction  i could hear  it  burning through  the air and could easliy see  the flames whipping off the the back of it  i remember thinking it looked like a flaming ice cream cone on its side the way the flames looked fanning around from the front of it  and meeting in the back of it  i remember  there seemed to be some kind of a nipple shaped object on the front of it kinda like  whata bell has,  the object kept going in the direction  until it had passed over the buildings and wasnt outta sight , while seeing it i started yelling to the various people on the street to look at that thing i fell back wards off the wall on my butt while i watched it go out of sight ,again it was very low ,moving slow,  not like a meteor  which moves fast , i could easliy see the flames and hear it  . my mom picked me up and i told her about it   when i got home  i called the local nike sight to report what i saw and ask about it  as usual noone new nothing. as the years passed i never forgot what i saw in fact i can still see it to this day  but never heard anything about it until  in 1990     on the tv show unsolved mysteries the  story popped up   then again just a few years ago on  bryant gumbles special, this is a true story  and id swear on a stack of bibles   as to what i saw  , also  that night the sky was still in thetwilight stage  and i remember it as being unusualy warm for that time of the year as i remember now, that christmas season  was in the 50 degree range.((NUFORC Note:  Witness may have been witness to the object, which caused the Kecksburg Incident.

I was looking almost straight up and observed it traveling from north to south, it was above a plane taking off and below a plane traveling from east to west at about 35000 ft. It left no contrail nor did it seem to make any noise. I called for my wife to come out and see it, but she didn&apos;t make it in time. It was moving faster than any aircraft in the sky judging by the other aircraft speeds.

The light was outrunning the jet. We then saw the third light which seemed to change from red to white.  All this is taken place at roughly 400-600 feet.  I could hear and see the fighter jet plainly but no noise at all from these lights nor did i ever see an object just these very tiny lights.

I could see people standing outside and other people slowing down, almost to a complete stop just to look at it. It had 3 lights on it, and all were at the front of the aircraft.

Driving North at approx 21:30 at night along the coast road we saw a bright orange light in the distance that resolved into 2 orange lights side by side.  Passing under the lights I looked out the car window to see a triangle shaped object hovering approx 100 metres above us and approx 20 degrees to one side of our vehicle.The orange lights that we could see from a distance were no longer visible. We pulled over and crossed the road where we were close to being underneath an object that had several large red and green lights underneath, with a large central white light. There were small winking lights on the 2 outside (wings) of the delta shape. We could clearly see the outline of the craft and that it was silent and hovering in place. The craft was an isosceles triangle that appeared to be the size of a small civilian aircraft in width. Only one other vehicle passed us during this time and the passengers ignored our efforts to point out the object. After approx 2 mins hovering the craft rotated on its axis and slowly moved East away from our position. It stayed the same altitude and we watched until the craft had moved off into the distance and out of sight. Since the craft had moved off in the direction of our home suburb I told the boys to keep a lookout. We encountered the craft crossing the main highway approx 8 kilometres from where we first saw it. We turned down the nearest street to pace the craft that was slowly following large power lines behind suburban housing. At this point we noticed 3 smaller winking lights come in at speed from the surrounding night sky and join with the object. The boys kept the craft under observation while I drove parallel to its course. Approx 30 seconds after the smaller objects joined with the craft the boys said that it had suddenly gone straight up into the sky at great speed.As I was driving I did not see the craft leave though when I did look to the side a second later the craft was gone. We made a report to a local UFO investigator who (with our permission) passed the sighting onto a local newspaper. Wishing to remain anonymous we did not give any personal details except to confirm what the investigator had told them. I have not referred this sighting to any other person since that time. I understand that this is an old sighting, tho I hope it may add to your knowledge of these events. I have drawings made the same night by the boys and myself if you should be interested.", "Silver object skimmed across horizon just above tree lines on State Bridge RdMy friend and I where on the way to regal cinemas. My friend was driving his truck. We where headed towards MEDLOCK BRIDGE RD on STATE BRIDGE RD going down the hill before the   DOUBLEGATE subdivision. This is where they have been doing road work for over 4 years. My friend and I are consumed in a conversation about girlfriends. I first notice something in the distant horizon. I dont know how it got my attention but I guess my eyes were wondering. I noticed a small oval shaped object. I would say it was silver but I have no idea. It also had a shimer of light coming off of it. The light was white/silver but again this could have been a reflection off of the sun/object. I pointed it out to my friend who then stopped talking comletely and we both looked at it in AWE. I quickly said the first thing that popped in my mind. &quot; Dude do you see what I am seeing?&quot;. He responded with the same amazement. The object appeared to be hovering. I judged this based on the fact you can see a radio cell phone tower in the distance over the horizon as well. After no more than 5 seconds on originally spotting it the object begain to move to the left slowly. It then moved back to the right slowly. Then all of a sudden before I could react, the object then shot across the entire horizon. I very quickly yelled &quot; oh my god, look at how fast its going. That cannot be an airplane, seriously look at how fast it is going.&quot; Now by the time I had the whole sentance out the object went from one side of the horizon to the other and dissapeared behind some trees. The windows were rolled down and there was no sound other than traffic that I could hear. Although this does not mean there was no sound to the object, I just could not hear anything. My friend and I both talked about it to everyone we knew that night. Nobody would believe us. We have kept this secret until now when I found this website. I wanted to post this only for the fact of documentation and also to do my part at uncovering the truth behind UFOs. I MUST say that this was in NO way an hallucination. WE saw what we saw. I know for a fact this could not be a normal aircraft. I cannot say this was absolutly spacecraft either. What I can say is that the craft was deffinatly unidentifiable. It moved faster than an airplane could. Once it started moving it went from one side of the horizon to the other in less than 10 seconds. the whole sighting lasted maybe 15 seconds. The span of the horizon is about a 7-10 miles in distance. The object was just above the tree lines (which also includes several upscale neighborhoods within those trees.) and couldnt have been more than 100 yards up in the air. Still to this day I can recall the fellings I had when it happend. I became very uncomfortable yet very interested at the same time. I have been affraid of UFO/Aliens for many years until I became interested in the truth. I have only seen one other unidentified object before. Nothing that made me feel the way this did. Please someone confirm they have seem SOMETHING like this before. Please I want to know I am not crazy. Thanks for taking time to listen to my report.

I was awoken in the middle of the night unable to move.  I was completely paralyzed and lost conciousness soon after.  I had a dream in which I remember my skull being &quot;cracked&quot; open.  I didn&apos;t actually see anything, but I remember the sensation much like people remember sensations during surgery.  I awoke in my bed, I was unharmed, but for some unknown reason, I was terrified.  I heard a strange noise outside that sounded like a loud &quot;hum&quot; and a steady vibration that rattled every fibre of my body.  The noise circled around my house several times at an incredibly fast rate, at least one revolution every few seconds.  I could not see an object and I was too afraid to look out a window, but I did see some strange lights glowing through the window.  I had never heard this sound before, but for some reason, it terrified me.  The sound had to have come from a machine of great power and the &quot;hum&quot; was similar to that your hear at a power relay staion only amplified thousands of times.  I recognized the sound, but had no memory of it.  I only knew that I didn&apos;t like it...  I attempted to wake my family up, but to my astonishment, the would not wake up as if they were sedated somehow.  Eventually, the object left the area.  I was almost convinced it was a dream, but I forced myself to stay awake till morning and I turned on the television to establish my sanity.  Incidentally, as soon as the object left, I was able to wake my family, but they had no memory of the indcident and dismissed my experience as a vivid dream.  The experience was the most terrifying thing I have witnessed in my life and I have suffered from post-tramatic stress syndrome since then.  I am not the first person in my family that has had a close encounter with a UFO.  My grandmother woke in the middle of the night to observe a diamond shaped object that had a blinding glow.  The next day, her eyes swelled shut and the doctor that examined her indicated that her retinas were burned.  The ammount of damage to her eyes was consistent to light several times that of the sun; they had no explanation, but she recovered.  The object also burned a trail the the yard just outside the window.  My father also experienced a close encounter with a UFO when he was young.  Since he grew up with no electricity and no automobiles in the middle of ND, the closest he could describe the objects he saw were, &quot;fire-wagons&quot;.  He has little memory of the incident.  There is a history of Schizophrenia in the Family, but my Grandmother, my Father, and I have not been diagnosed with the condition.

I was unable to sleep, and walked to my window to look west across the lawn over into the area of Presser Hall, and, after a few seconds in the window, my attention was drawn upward by an unusual object. The sky was clear, with no adverse weather conditions, and I recall no noise whatsoever.  But, I noted an object, which I can only describe as a black or other dark colored equilateral triangle which appeared from not directly above my building, but rather at an eleven o&apos;clock position.  The most striking feature about this object was that it did not fly with a logical leading edge.  In other words, if twelve o&apos;clock would be straight ahead, and the nose position on a conventional aircraft, this object&apos;s corners were at roughly two o&apos;clock, five o&apos;clock, and nine o&apos;clock.  Continuous white lights were observed at the two and nine o&apos;clock positions, and a continuous red light was observed at the five o&apos;clock position, which would approximate the &quot;tail&quot; of the aircraft.  This object left no contrail, and made no noise whatsoever.  While difficult to state with certainty, I would estimate the object to be approximately 1,000 feet above ground level, traveling due west.  I watched the object pass over the Bethany Campus, and lost sight of it as it disappeared behind Presser Hall and various trees. At no time did this object perform any stunning maneuvers, or violate any fundamentals of physics.  At the time, I noted mentally that I was less than 100 miles north of McConnell Air Force Base, and initially attributed the object to a military test of some sort, but soon realized that McConnell is not really known as being a test facility.  I remained at Bethany until May of 1998, and never again saw anything similar to this craft, but did, on numerous occasions, witness various military aircraft in the area over the years.  Aside from the bizarre angle and leading edge placement, I could easily attribute this to a craft of Earthly origin.  However, at present, some twelve years later, I have yet to see anything about new military aircraft that have a leading edge built in such a manner.  It struck me as odd enough that I made a crude sketch immediately after seeing the object.  (In 2004, after hearing a radio program in which Mr. Colm Kelleher of the National Institute of Discovery Science discuss sightings of so called &quot;black triangles,&quot; I drew the object in a more detailed manner, and attempted to place it &quot;to scale.&quot;  I subsequently filed a report on this incident with N.I.D.S. and included my original and later drawings, which I will forward to NUFORC in a separate email submission.)  As the object was so dark and blended into the night sky, I could not tell definitively if the object was a proper triangle, or if the edges were more rounded.  Therefore, in the more detailed drawing, the edges of the object are drawn both as straight lines and as curved lines.  I am certain the object was not perfectly round, in any event.", "I was sitting outside on my front porch with a friend (we are in our late 20&apos;s), watching the sky. Suddenly we both see a white/yellowish light traveling south at an incredibly high speed (approx 1000mph or more). The object did not descend or slow down. It was traveling at a constant speed at approx.a  few thousand feet high. It was very quiet outside and the object did not emit any sound whatsoever nor did it have any blinking lights nor a headlight. We continued to watch the object until it left our field of view, not losing speed or altitude. I have seen many strange looking objects in the sky before which were explainable by either natural phanomena or conventional aircraft. Unfortunately, this object did not pause in mid-air nor had made any right angle turns, but I believe it was worth reporting, so hopefully you can give us some kind of insinght or info regarding our sighting.

A few of my friends and I were walking home from a party about 3 blocks away from my house. We were goofing around and having fun as we walked home. at around 11:40 I looked up at the sky and looked at an object that I had thought was the moon and I thought to myself &quot;Hmm... The moon is awfully small tonight&quot; and laughed to myself. So we got to the corner of my block and walked down the hill to my house when I looked up again and I noticed the &quot;moon&quot; was kind of following us. I asked my friend to look up and she said the same exact thing I was thinking &quot;Wow the moon looks awfully small doesnt it?&quot;. It was emitting this sort of yellowish glow, and was really eluminated. I thought I was going crazy, and it really creeped me out. My other friends then looked up as well and were like &quot;what the hell is that thing in the sky?&quot; and about 12 seconds after they said that it sped away through the night sky, and as soon as it dissappeared it started to rain. I dont know what that thing was or if it was even the reason for it to start raining but I know it creeped me out, I searched google to see if I could find any sphere shaped objects in the sky and it lead me to UFO&apos;S so I searched UFO&apos;s and found this site and thought it was worthy to report my case. This is really uncommon in such an  urban place (or so i thought), I never seen or heard anything like this happening over here, and especially in the Bronx. I thought things like this happened in kentucky or tenessee to backwoods insest-ial cousin families, but when I saw this sphere, this thing move across the sky it creeped me out so much I&apos;m afraid to even set foot outside my door. My mother thinks I&apos;ve gone crazy and the other friends I was with during this night have gone into denial, with the exception of my one friend who is pretty creeped out as well. I keep looking over my shoulder to see if anything is there, that is how creeped out I am about this.

We all went outside and noticed there was another red light which appeared to be following the first one. At first we thought they must be hot air balloons, one following the other, or perhaps they were attached in some way but it was too dark to see. We were looking for bursts of flames as we were looking for these balloons or perhaps the sound of a burst but there wasnt a single sound during the whole duration of the sighting nor did the lights flicker or distort in any way. We didnt seem to be able to focus correctly on the objects, they appeared to be blurred somewhat, i thought it was my eyesight at first (which is normally A+) but we all mentioned we couldnt focus on them. They appeared to be travelling at identical speeds, one following the other. They werent travelling very fast, it almost looked as though they were being carried by the wind until we noticed that the second ufo appeared to go closer to the first and then slow down again. We couldnt determine whether they were low flying or high flying. They were quite bright red lights that appeared to be flying low but because we couldnt hear any sound at all we all assumed they were flying quite high in the sky. If they were at a high altitude then these objects must be quite large in size. We watched them for about 15-20 minutes, one constantly following the other. They appeared to be increasing altitude as they were getting further away. The second ufo kept moving closer and slowing down from the first ufo. The leading ufo appeared to remain at a steady speed. As they gradually moved further away heading north, the second ufo appeared to break away from the first moving off to the right in an easterly direction. It then disappeared either into clouds or just out of vision we couldnt quite make it out. About 20 seconds later the first ufo disappeared also either into clouds or out of vision.

I parked to look closer and it was  moving very oddly and traveling toward Moorpark. I called my sister and drove back toward my parent&apos;s house where she was at the top of First St. This is where my sister, her friend and I saw the object travel further away, upward.

The object was a very bright white slash of light about the length of arc that a dime would subtend at arms length.  What caused me to be very surprised at the sighting was that I could detect no wings or tail assembly.  It was totally cloudless blue sky and no contrail was observed from this &quot;object&quot;.  Just after noticing this the pilot came on and announced that we had leveled out at our cruising altitude of 31,000 ft.  This meant that the object was considerably above us in altitude and if at 5 miles distance would likely have been at well over 40,000 ft - and unusual altitude for a commercial flight in good weather.  In any event, the object paralleled our course for about 2 mins and then appeared to receed to the north without ever changing the aspect ratio of its profile....thus it changed direction without appearing to turn as does an airplane.

I am well traveled and have seen lots of oddities in my lifetime. The event I witnessed last Saturday morning was disturbing.An employee and I were standing in the parking lot of my business chatting. It was a bright sunny day with spotty high clouds and a very light breeze. I noticed a large number of small clouds suddenly form in the sky to the north just below the upper cloud level.Curiously, these small clouds started traveling downward in an arc. Other small clouds appeared behind the first, and more behind those, forming a steady stream of clouds.Three larger clouds appeared. These cloud objects traveled across the sky in a straight line formation to a point overhead and remained stationary during the entire event.The steady stream of smaller cloud-like objects continued their downward arc at a slowing rate of speed. As they neared our position, the mist surrounding these objects began to disappear, revealing shimmering egg-shaped objects. The skin of these objects were a bit translucient. As the objects lowered in altitude further, this skin became completely transparent.The objects reached treetop level just over our heads, traveling at a quick rate of speed, approximately 50 mph. Hundreds of them passed overhead. The outer skin of these objects appeared to be a membrane of sorts. Inside this membrane, another object appeared.The inner object was a segmented globe, much like a soccer ball. The outer skin of this object seemed reflective--reflective not of the sunlight but of the sky around it. Struts or wires or something protruded from the bottom of the globe to a pointed horseshoe shaped thing with bright silver flashing lights on the underside. These lights flashed in series from the rear of the object to the front.After passing over our heads, these objects headed skyward. They disappeared at a point just below the cloud level.", "While traveling northbound toward SR32, I saw two amber orbs on the northern horizon.

I&rsquo;m leaning out of my window for all of two minutes when I see three of these really strange oval shape things crossing the sky in front of my window. At first I thought they might be really weird looking planes, but they were traveling at speeds far faster than any plane or anything in the sky I have seen in my life travel at, except perhaps a bird swooping very quickly downward...except these things weren&rsquo;t traveling downward. They were also the wrong shape for any type of plane and glowed all over like really big, really close, really bright stars. Despite all the evidence against it, I rationalized that they could be fighter planes...until I realized seconds later that there were making no sound, at all. It was at that point that I decided to stop rationalizing what they were and just watch them, since I was obviously looking at something I probably wouldn&rsquo;t see again. To my amazement, and slightly to my horror, one of the objects on the fair right of the other two moved at a crazy speed to the object on the fair left and went really close to it, almost touching and then moved away, almost like those tiny birds that move together, moving close to each other for a minute before smoothly swerving away; although, nothing like that at all, the movement was way too smooth, too fast, too big, it was more like oh I don&rsquo;t know two cartoon ovals on a screensaver or something almost touching and then (usually with some weird windows ping sound moving away)they were kind of like blood cells, on the Virgin Airline TVs when people get on and off the plane, except smoother and faster in their movement, but much like the relationship of the blood cells in that movie. Anyway the three objects then proceed to begin (again much to my amazement and horror) to weave inside and outside of each other, making a pattern like weaving a plait. All the while moving amazingly fast and glowing faintly orange. It was as if they were playing with each other, I could not see more however, as the weaving pattern and their movement caused them to move out of my line of sight. I was in shock. I stood there for quite a while going over what happened in my mind. The whole thing must have been less than a minute long; I stood by my window for much longer.My first instinct (strangely enough, since I&rsquo;m not usually like this) was to forget it ever happened, to assume that it was simply something normal than appeared abnormal from my location. My conscious mind kicked in at that point and stopped the panicky defense mechanism of repressing and rationalizing from taking hold, and I told myself as I went to bed that night that I had to ask anyone that would listen and understood my Spanish if they saw anything strange last night or if there are any weird birds in this part of the world who reflect the electric light from the cities they fly over (my rationalization that allowed me to get to sleep). So I go into school the next day, happy that I hadn&rsquo;t repressed the experience in the night, and asked my friend if she had seen anything odd last night (drawing her a crude picture). She shook her head and had no idea what to say to me, so we both asked the teacher if they were in fact any birds that reflected the electric lights of the cities they flied over. The teacher glanced at my drawing, listened to my rationale and description and proceeded to tell me that it was probably a UFO and that not only that he&rsquo;d seen several odd things shooting across the sky growing up here, but also that &uml;a lot of people see them, usually in summer. We don&rsquo;t know if Nasa has some testing field here or something, but they are about. Most, however, are too drunk to really give an apt description at that time of night.&uml;", "Helicopter Orbits Bright Red Light(s)We were driving back from Blockbuster heading south on Campbell near 6th Street.  I saw a helicopter in the sky (nothing new around here) but it was orbiting around a bright red light that wasn&apos;t moving in the sky. The helicopter was about 1 block away from the object an it had its nose pointed to it the whole time - along with the spotlight on it. There was nothing to see other than the bright red light. As we headed south down the road towards 8th Street (and getting a little closer) I noticed that it could have been 3 bright red lights close to each other. From our position, it was located SE, not too far away, and probably around 100 feet in the air. The helicopter continued to orbit the object with the spotlight on it. My eyes dashed to the road and back up and it was gone. My wife had continued watching and said that it just turned off. The helicopter hung around for about 10 seconds more before heading south. By the time we stopped the car at our house and got to the sidewalk, the helicopter was long gone and there was still nothing in the sky where the helicopter had been orbiting the object. The whole event lasted maybe 2-3 minutes before the light had turned off.", "Very bright white object moving slowly then quickly going straight up till it could be seen no longer.I went out to my car and this really bright light caught my eye and it is really hard to explain a shape because it was so bright. When looking at it I saw like these rays beaming off it from the brightness.  It appeared to be moving slowly, lower towards the earth and north.  Then it just started going up till I couldnt see it anymore.  It didn&apos;t move sideways at all while going up.  I didn&apos;t observe any colored lights on it at all.  From the time I saw it till it disappeared was approximately 45 seconds to a minute.", "Long cylinder shape with chrome mirrored dome top viewed coming apart and reatatching itself over Sault Ste. Marie, MIOn June 28, 2006 I was measuring my backyard and preparing it for concrete when a big object caught my attention out of the corner of my eye. It was right over the neighbors house about 600-900ft. off the ground. I estimated that distance by using a radio tower which was right under the object as my way of figuring out how far off the ground it was. I believe that the radio tower is approximately 300ft. tall. It looked to be approximately two maybe two and a half of those towers from the ground. there was no noise at all. I grabbed my 12x50 binoculars and viewed the object for approximately 35 minutes without any movement at all. During those 35 minutes I made a drawing on my clipboard of the object as I viewed it through my binoculars. I wasn&apos;t going to call or tell anyone due to the fact of what other people might think. I figured I would just watch the thing until it took off. This thing was unbelieveable! It was tall and slender with a long shaft coming out from the bottom. On the top at an angle from the top and side was a chrome mirrored dome and there was a chrome gold reflection coming from around that same area. As I was watching the object through my binocs the dome turned towards me then stopped and a small object came out from the bottom of the long shaft and floated towards the top. It stopped beside the top of the craft and orbitted around the it twice before connecting itself to the top. Then the dome turned back towards the direction it was first facing which was NE and it never left that position the whole time. Right then I called my father-in-law, who is a sargent at the city police department, to come over and view this thing as a witness but he was sleeping because he just got off from his night shift. I told my mother-in-law that this was no joke and that they should get over here as soon as possible because there is a UFO over the house and that it was coming apart and reatatching itself. She told me to call the police, which I immediately did. I told the dispatcher who I was, that I was Mel&apos;s son-in-law and that this was no joke, and to send someone over right away because I believe there is a UFO over the house. The dispatcher laughed and said &quot;sure, I&apos;ll send someone right over&quot;. My mother-in-law arrived by herself which was about five minutes after I called. (police never came). By the time she arrived it moved a little higher and to the south and stopped. She viewed it through the binocs as well and couldn&apos;t believe it herself. We both watched it for about 20 minutes before the neighbor pulled in next door. She viewed it for about 10 to 15 minutes before it disappeard into the sky. The dome never left its position facing the NE. It would move a little bit and stop. It did that about three or four times heading south and then it just moved slowly at an angle towards the atmosphere and disappeared behind a cloud. My mother-in-law went home and called the city police department and talked to one of the officers at the desk and asked why they didn&apos;t go out on the call and they said they were never dispatched. So the officers came over themselves after talking to my mother-in-law but by this time we never saw it again. They questioned me and waited a while to see if it would show again but it never did. I know the officers personally and they know I would have never called on something like this unless it was true. My father-in-law talked to the captain and they suggested that I go to your web site and log what I saw. I strongly believe that if the officer or anyone else with a video cam video taped this thing at that close of a distance for that long a period of time, that there wouldn&apos;t have been any other civilian evidence on earth with that much visual detail!

The night was quiet and clear. Suddenly, my brother startled me by exclaiming &quot; What the hell is that ?!&quot;. He pointed to the eastern horizon and there just above the water was an oddly shaped RECTANGULAR object (it had 90 degree corners). The amber color object appeared to just hang motionless for about 30-40 seconds. It was tilted at a weird angle. Shortly thereafter, the object started to slowly move in our general direction with the same odd tilt. As it moved towards us, the object moved higher in the sky. It was nearly 90 degrees straight up when it instantly disappeared. Then about 5 seconds later, the amber color craft reappeared but this time it was CIRCULAR or SPHERICALLY shaped. It continued moving due west for a few more seconds when it made a 90 degree left hand turn which brings the object in the sky above our heads. It then began a series of impossible S turns above our heads. We became concerned that this object was too weird and close for comfort so we threw our fishing gear into the truck and started the engine. At this point, the object finished one last S curve when it suddenly accelerated into an incredibly fast and impossible upward corkscrew movement that took it straight up and out of the atmosphere. The corkscrew exit from the atmosphere lasted only 3 to 5 seconds ! Left behind in it&apos;s wake, was a glowing corkscrew shaped ion trail in the sky that lasted about 45 seconds. We were completely dumbfounded but assured each other that whatever it was that we saw had defied the laws of physics and human technical knowledge. The entire sighting lasted about 5 minutes. There was no sound whatsoever. The object remained several thousand feet above us but was possibly the size of a large airliner or bigger. Note that there was a report of a similar UFO by a seperate witness about 10 away miles. This sighting was in the vicinity of MacDill AFB over Tampa Bay.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My husband is a retired professor (university), and I am a housewife, we do not do drugs, and are convinced that these in no way could be stars, nor planes.There were also a few others on the beach looking into the sky..but hey, its New York..who wants to ask anyone if they saw a ufo!", "Large lighted silhouette of a face in the sky.I&apos;m fairly certain this was in 1976.

We were just sitting there talking and enjoying the evening. I was looking up at the sky and the stars and saw something in the sky to the west. I&apos;ll describe it as a light, because that is what it would most closely resemble. It was more like a grayer area of the sky, but translucent enough to see the stars through it. The frightening thing is that it was shaped like the typical &quot;devil face&quot; outline complete with horns and a grimacing mouth. At first we thought it was being projected by one of those big searchlights they used to use for grand openings, etc., but there was no beam of light visible coming up from the ground. My dad was working for Rockwell at the time, but not up at Rocketdyne. He was trying to figure out what was causing this quite obvious shape in the sky, and was getting pretty upset. My mom was just quiet and looked scared. We watched it for about 20 minutes, and it never changed or moved in any way. I don&apos;t know what size it was, but it was bigger than my hand as I held it up . We watched it for awhile and then went inside. I was assuming there was some logical explanation, and we would read about it in the paper the next day, but as far as I know, nobody else saw or reported it. Even stranger, about a month or so later, I was outside with some friends at about the same time, and was telling them about what I had seen, and described the shape. One of my friends pointed up and said &quot;do you mean like that?&quot;....and there it was again, in the same place. We all watched it for a few minutes, and it gradually faded and was no longer visible. The only indication I have ever had that anyone else saw this was a drawing on the cover of a &quot;Weekly Reader&quot; type newspaper they used to hand out at school. The paper came out a year or so later, but had an article about UFO sightings, etc. inside. The cover drawing depicted a night sky with the exact same shape in it, and I believe whoever drew it must have seen the same thing as I did. It was accompanied by the caption &quot;Are We Alone?&quot; or something similar. I kept that copy for many years, but can no longer find it.

This time it was a little further south, but still, keeping parallel to the Cassiopeia &ldquo;W&rdquo;. The light would come on for about &frac14;-1/2 second, then go out.  It was not a quick on/off, but there was some ramping up and down of the amplitude.  It almost seemed as though it was rotating or something.  The on/off nature reminded me of a lightning bug, but it clearly was not that since it maintained a very consistent path in the sky relative to Cassiopeia, even though we moved about &frac14; mile during our observations.  It &ldquo;flashed&rdquo; about 8 times or so before stopping.  We estimate it was traveling about 1 to 2 degrees per minute. I am a mechanical engineer, and my wife is a student of veterinary medicine.", "It was the unusual movement that made all who were observing the object consider it a UFO.While on Field Training Excersise with the Georgia Army National Guard at Fort Stewart Georgia I witnessed this event along with a number of other soldiers.  We were firing artillery that night and I was on the Observation Point along with a number of other soldiers.  I cannot remember how many objects we saw that night but I am sure of one.  The object appeared at a high altitude.  It was a crisp winter night with little or no moon.  All of the stars were quite clear.  I am used to looking for satellites in the night sky.  I was a COMSEC Officer with the 1/230 Field Artillery Battalion.  Along with Forward Observers on the OP were a number of Active duty evaluators who were assigned to our unit for evaluation. The object caught someones eye and soon we were all viewing object.  Each of us trying to find an explaination.  The object which appeared as s small star in the sky just kept moving in very bazaar movements.  It zigged and zagged but it seemed to stay overhead.  Of course we were on a very important military base and all considered it some kind of spy satellite.  It seemed to looking at us.  The movements were so unusual that we had to call it a UFO.  Some thought it might be a weather balloon.  No balloon would stay in a pattern such as the object that night.  It was not a flight path of any known flying objects I have ever seen nor my fellow soldiers many of which had years of active duty.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was a blue light, shaped like a globe/orb, with a &quot;tail&quot; of orange behind it/ connected to it. On impulse I got up really quickly and looked out, but it was gone. It was travelling really fast, straight forward and making no sound. It wasn&apos;t as high up as an aeroplane, but a lot higher up than my building. It was definitely not a firework. I&apos;ve never been interested in UFOs, but this was totally weird and I got a bit freaked out/confused and decided to see if I could find an explanation on the internet.

I just saw something fly over the hills behind my house. I usually sit on the back porch in the afternoons, leaning against the screen door, looking at the cows on the hill. 10 minutes earlier as usual I was quietly observing them. Then from over the hill this silver thing flies in a fast, straight line, just over the hill. It kept moving forward a little, but seemed to have stopped and turned around. It stayed in place until it found a direction. It started moving to the right slowly. I was standing up by this time and moving closer to the fence. By the time I got to the fence the thing disappeared. It was gone. It didn&apos;t fly over the hills again, it had already moved a good way out from them. Unless it moved faster than I could see... I saw it and then it disappeared. I was thinking, maybe it was a balloon? But the wind was going over the hills in the other direction. When it came over the hills in my direction it was coming fast, then it stopped. It still moved upward and north the last time I saw it. I distinctly saw the shape of it and it wasn&apos;t round, nor was it oblong, it was not the shape of a balloon. It looked like a &quot;flying saucer&quot; with a lid on it. It was flat and shiny on the bottom, and the top looked like an oval cut in half and attached to it. It was definately bigger than at least eight big black cows put together. I saw its dimensions after it flew over the hill and turned around abruptly. It moved to the left, then back to the right, slowly moving toward the Bay and shifting direction, until it disappeared. It was silver and shiny and distinctive in the clear blue sky. There was nothing else up in the sky at that time. Nothing flies that low over the hill in the direction toward my house.

Earlier in the afternoon on 6/24/06, we were cleaning out my closet and found my night-vision moncular and decided it would be fun to look at the stars through the monocular later in the evening.  At 2354 that evening(6/24/06), we turned off the lights in my single-story condominium and proceeded outside on my patio, which does not have a screen.  I turned on the night-vision monocular and looked upward directly above my head (12 o&apos;clock high position)and was looking at a brighter star and then proceeded to focus the monocular.  Once in focus to my amazement, I noticed movement of a dimly glowing circular object in the reticle.  The object gave off a glow as well in the night-vision monocular and I advised my girlfriend, &quot;Honey, I think there is a satellite orbiting across the sky here!&quot;  I showed her the object that was moving in a west to east straight trejectory across the sky at a phenomenal rate of speed, no turns or deceleration or acceleration were noted, therefore assuming this object was a satellite.  We then proceeded into the house and got online with the NASA website to see if their were any satellites that could be seen in our area but the NASA website indicated there were no satellites visible for our viewing area.  I then assumed the object was more than likely a classified satellite.  To quell my curiousity, we both went out on our patio the next evening (6/25/06) and began to scan the sky in the same area with the night-vision monocular intentionally at approxiamately the same time as the evening before in anticipation of the same orbiting satellite.  We were on the patio, and I told my girlfriend jokingly, &quot;I wonder if we will get lucky and see my satellite again?&quot;  At 2354, myself looking through the night-vision and my girlfriend looking with her naked eye, she shouts,&quot;Honey, what is that?&quot;  At precisely the same moment, the object that she described as being spherical and red in color, came into the reticle of the night-vision monocular that I was using giving off a dim glow.  My description would be the same as the night before, the object was round in shape but I could not determine any color due to looking through the night-vision monocular.  We both tracked the object for approxiamately 3-5 seconds, which once again appeared almost in the same exact area in the sky as the night before.  Once again, the object was traveling in a west to east trajectory but was moving at a higher rate of speed than the night before, as well as performing two sudden sharp turns, one hard turn right then a second abrupt turn to the left and then disappearing behind a cloud lower on the horizon.  The object had no trailing tail similar to that of a shooting star or made any noise whatsoever.  The sudden dynamic turns the object made was incredible, and being a veteran of the U.S. military, I was convinced this was no conventional aircraft.  In conclusion, my girfriend and I are both left with no explanation of what this object could possibly be.  I assumed from the night before, in my mind, this was an orbiting satellite, now we have no clue to what this was and why has it appeared twice at night consecutively, and furthermore, why has it appeared almost at the same exact time???", "lights mission hillsa bright light as if a star it appear for a couple of second and desapear and apear  far away in seconds.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I didn&rsquo;t consider the strange emotional/mental after effects, the bizarre amnesiac hangover, until recalling the event years later.*ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Approximate distances from nearby military designations to Overbrook, Kansas: ---Fort Leavenworth, in Leavenworth County, near Leavenworth, KS--85 miles to the Northeast ---Fort Riley, in Geary and Riley Counties, between Junction City and Manhattan, KS--97 miles West/Northwest --- McConnell Air Force Base, in Sedgwick County, near Wichita, KS--145 mile Southwest  Approximate distance from nearby Nuclear power plant: ---Wolf Creek Nuclear Plant in Burlington, KS--49 miles South  Here&rsquo;s my account of what happened:  There were three of us in the car (each a student or soon to be student at KU). My best friend was driving her car; I was in the front passenger seat, and our friend (also our housemate) was in the back behind the driver&apos;s seat. We were driving on rural roads to visit her (friend in backseat) sister and brother-in-law who lived around Overbrook, Kansas. I was looking down while rolling a cigarette when she exclaimed, &quot;Look!&quot; For some reason, I immediately looked up and out through my window as my best friend did through the windshield; it seemed as though we just knew where to look. Surprisingly, we did not feel afraid but were filled with awe, and I had the presence of mind to look at the car&apos;s clock and record the time, date, and scrawl a rudimentary sketch of the object.  After a few seconds, we stopped the car; we got out and watched the object until it disappeared over the horizon. I waved my arms and yelled to attract attention, but got no noticeable response. When we got back into the car, I went over the basic features of the event, and asked if we each agreed upon the basics of what was witnessed. We were in concordance: 1) we had all seen the craft; 2) we were sober; 3) it was gigantic; 4) it was silent; 5) it was flying slowly and low to the ground. We also agreed that it was wingless, but about a year ago, I spoke with my best friend about that night, and her memory is fuzzy as to whether or not it was. This has me wondering how and to what degree each friend recalls the event.  I wish I had written an unofficial affidavit on the spot, to be signed by we three.  As for myself, I know that memory can degrade over time, but this I remember vividly, because it struck me as such an incredible sight: the craft was WINGLESS. The object flew above the tree line, though seemingly not too much higher. It is difficult to gauge, being as it was at night, over a basically flat field with few trees, and I am not an expert on altitude. I try to explain it like this: extend your flattened palm between one foot&apos;s distance from the tip of your nose to maybe the full extension of your arm (flexibility of distance to account for fallibility of memory); this is about how it seemed, except that the breadth was more expansive. It was LARGE. MASSIVE. Kind of like a flying football field in the sky. It appeared to be constructed of some kind of metal, with a flat bottom, and I remember specifically being amazed that I could see that the bottom was not a singular piece of material, but consisted of plates of metal that looked to be fastened with rivets. It reminded me of a quilt. The underside also had several (don&apos;t know how many--more than 10, I would say) lights, which I recall to be similar to regular car headlights, except probably much more powerful, and were puzzling to me because they seemed to have been, figuratively, sprinkled on--their arrangement appeared sporadic, haphazard, disorganized, erratic. Also organic. To my recollection, they were constant, and did not flicker, nor did they graze the ground. I remember only seeing the underside of the object, which we all agreed appeared to be wingless. The shape is difficult to describe, because it doesn&apos;t conform to any geometric shape; the closest I&apos;ve been able to come is to compare it to an expansive, slightly elongated hexagon. But the main feature for us, and what took us aback, was that it was absolutely, positively SILENT. I could not tell the speed at which it traveled, except to say that it did not dart, and stayed on a &quot;straight&quot; course over the field at a &ldquo;slowish,&rdquo; steady and deliberate pace: imagine a pope&apos;s hand waving slowly over a crowd. I wish I had kept track of the time with my watch, but I was absorbed in the sight; however, I think we watched it somewhere from 15 seconds to a minute before it met the horizon line and was beyond our vision. To my recollection, we did not experience any interference with any electrical components of the car or accessories on our person, nor do I remember static on the radio, but knowing my friend, we were probably listening to a CD--don&apos;t know if that matters.  After it passed, we got back into the car, and drove to the sister and brother-in-law&apos;s house.  I think we did, but am uncertain if we told them about what we had just seen.", "Every night they are up an over Sacramento and the SierrasI have been watching what I believe to be Military aircraft for weeks now. They appear to be from Beal AFB and/or somewhere south. They hover like stars in the sky and can bleep in and out as needed.

As I did,,, I noticed that they seem to be aware of me watching them. As I drove home about 10 miles. I could see and feel one at my back all the times. I had to go see my mother. Even though I had to talk to her,I was afraid to tell my mother as she wouldn&apos;t have believed me,,, nor would my wife. THEY DO NOW!!!!!!!! When I set up the scope at my Mothers home,,, a large craft dropped out of the sky and hovered just behind the tree line. That was all the evidence my mother needed. She was at once astonished and then she scolded me and said &quot;believe me son,,, you don&apos;t want to keep doing this. As usual I didn&apos;t listen,,, perhaps someday I will. I went home and got my son,,, we dove 2 miles to a clear spot in the canyon. It was there that my son and I watched a craft hover over head at 800 to one thousand feet, and just drop to the ground. No sound???????? no movement not even any heat.. My son and I had a real bad feeling and chose to leave then. This is no joke. I would advise any skeptic not to look if you don&apos;t want to know. These are war games they are working on or,,, they are really in combat. See for yourself. My son is a believer now,,,, and my wife and mother are too.

It had no flashing lights, but it had an intense white light coming from it.  Mostly the light was from the bottom, but it would be from the sides as well.  The stranger thing about tonight as opposed to last week was that the object was shinning an intense light downward when suddenly an airplane not very high in the sky was traveling towards it, heading east.  As the plane got further east, suddenly there was no light and the object disappeared, but before it did it flashed a bright light like a flash from a camera.

I told him that I did and he should.I told him I was not leaving and that we were the hostile ones.We continued fishing.    I was sort of focussing on my line and the water and A SOLID BALL OF LIGHT ,as impressive as the moon,came from in between the island my friend was facing and the next island up,lower then the tops of the the mangrove tree&apos;s.   It showed up Quick and quite !  I looked up just as quick and focussed on it and my first thought was&quot; we&apos;re busted&quot; and I pointed at it and yelled &quot;God damn that is a bright light for somthing that doesn&apos;t make any noise&quot;And it TURNED OFF,   I followed it&apos;s path with my fingers waiting for the &quot;vessel&quot; to cross the lit up part of the harbour so i could see what it was and there was no vessel where one should have been. Where i was fishing gave me a view from my 1 o&apos;clock to 3 o&apos;clock of the stars touching the lights of the habour in the far distance,,that section of my vision was well lit..Nothing broke my vision of the stars and lights  The &quot;vessel&quot; that made a light like that would have to be big enough to be seen with out lights on.    This was a solid ball of light that can only be described as a smaller moon with no face. It did not project light as if to light up the way,,There didn&apos;t seem to be a filiment in the center making it brighter in the center  There was no glare off this thing at all and it did not make any sound at all.   We should have heard a vessel befor we saw one.We made sure of it when we chose that location.This thing was on us with the snap of a finger and I got a good look at it.  After yelling to him and pointing at it i said&quot;DID YOU SEE THAT ?&quot;  &quot;YOU DIDN&apos;T SEE THAT FU__IN BALL OF LIGHT JUST RIGHT THERE ?&quot;  He looked at me and shook his head.Just then my friends big reel started screeming ,We jumped up and he set the hook on somthing big,,We were scrambling around,Iwas moving poles ,pulled the anchor ,raised the motor,,after acouple of minutes we landed this big Searay.We were let down that it was a ray,,Meanwhile we had coasted or blown into the mangrove island to the point where we couldn&apos;t use the motor to get out.We had no light to speek of ,all the poles were tangled and the foliage was trying to take things over.We sat there and reflected briefly on the catch.I was back to the light thing and excitedly asked him if he saw it or not and he sort of shook his head no. I asked him what he saw when he thaught he saw fire flies and he said he didn&apos;t know and repeated once again that we needed to get out of here. I looked in to the island and focussed my eyes and asked him if he thought someone was on the island and he told me you couldn&apos;t get on the island and that there wasn&apos;t really any hard surface to stand on like some of the other islands we had seen.I asked him what was behind the island and he said nothing or another island. I asked him why it was lit up towards what seemed to be the middle of the island and he said he didn&apos;t know.  i pointed my finger towards the middle and down  and asked him &quot;Does it seem to you that there is light comming from the island and said there was.....Straight in to the 11oclock and down was lit up but there was no actual light to be seen but it was with out a doubt lit up.....I could see pretty far in there but couldn&apos;t see what was causing the light.    My hair stood up and felt like i was somewhere i wasn&apos;t safe to be and much to my own surprise was very concerned in getting the boat out of there quick. I had a very strong feeling we were about to be boarded by somthing i couldn&apos;t see and grew scared for the first time in years. I wasn&apos;t the same person who said he wasn&apos;t leaving. We used our net to pole out to open waters and left with our eyes focussed on the illumination coming from under the mangrove island.The Ball of light that I got a good look at came from under and i&apos;m sure out of the other side of the mangrove island.  Not only did I see it but i remember where the island is and I know they were there when we left ,uder the mangrove island.You would need a helicopter to lower you in to the middle of the island with a wet suit on and diving gear to check it out but i&apos;m sure you could get samples off of the vegitation At some point arroundand definately under that part of the island.They have what must be a good spot to bed down in under there or it is an entrance of some kind that they use to surface without being spotted.They travel below the brush line and go between and around the islands and not above to stay un seen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was driving on I-80 heading west, passing the city of Paterson; at 6:30 in the evening in June while the sky was still very sunlit, at the peak of rush hour from N.Y.C. so there were hundreds of other vehicles on the road. While I was driving, from my right ear I heard a very high pitched sound, like a turbo charger, and at that moment I saw a blue-white light heading right toward me at tremendous speed.  It was like a shooting star but only 30 ft. above the ground at the highest.  I know this because as it passed over I-80 the object was lower than the overpass ahead evenly following the contour of the hilly terrain, It was then that a hugh sonic boom occured and rocked my car off the left side wheels, it was such a bang that it felt like something had violently pushed my car, this got my girlfriends attention. Certianly. At this moment both my, and her left ears popped.  Yes just our left ears, remember the object passed from right to left.  As fast as it had appeared, it was gone.

RainierFrom my residence, I have a nearly unobstructed, other that neighboring apartments in the foreground, view of Mt. Rainier. I have taken many photos in the 11 years of being here. I saw the mountain this particular morning and it had a layer of clouds surrounding its flanks and the early day sun shining on the north side. So I grabbed my Canon 30D and mounted it&apos;s EF 75 - 300 mm f4 - 5.6 IS USM lens. I took a total of 4 shots, the first with just a UV filter, then added a polarized filter for the last 3. Then I scrolled through the 4 images on the camera monitor to pick the best one and deleted the other 3. I noticed in the one that I kept, 3 dark dots in the blue sky above the mountain. I have taken many images with birds or aircraft between the mountain and here and when you download into the computer, you can tell that is what they are - either birds or aircraft. Not in this case! These were certainly disk or cigar shaped. I snapped this particular image at 1/640 second and an aperture value of f9.0. The ISO was at 400, giving the &apos;grain&apos; or &apos;noise&apos; in the shot. My computer monitor is not that sharp, but I have viewed it on others that were. These also were not specks of dust on the imager, which I would have seen on the other shots. I have showed this to others, whom thought they looked rather odd. I did not physically see these - may not have been able to, given the shutter speed, but then again, it may not have caught my attention at that moment. Mt. Rainier is about 40 Miles away from Fife in a straight line - and these objects, by my guess, were about 20 miles or less from where I took this photo. I have no other explaination for what they are. I can not give a better desciption than this report, being I did not witness these with the naked eye, other than showing up on the camera imager.", "Dull yellow non flashing light traveling from south to north making no noise above the San Ramon ValleyMy wife and I were watching the stars as there was no power for several hours when we saw this circle object flying from south to north in a uniform fashion.

If I had to guess I&apos;d say that this object was traveling 1/3 to 50% faster than faster than a airliner at full cruising altitude but was much much higher.

Pinos 8350 feet altitude in the Chula Vista campground parking lot.  About a dozen other astronomers were observing or doing astrophotography.  I was using my 15 X 70 binoculars (4.3 degrees TFOV) on top of my monopod/mount and was looking at M31, the Andromenda Galaxy, when I noticed two points of light enter the field of vision. They had no apparent diameter, similar to the field stars in the FOV.  I estimate their magnitude at about 8 or 9. They entered the FOV from the left (north-east) with one light leading the other by about half a degree.  At first they were almost on the same track, maybe just slightly offset.  Then the second following light accelerated and pulled abreast and below the first light.  At this time they were basically parallel with each other and about half a degree distance apart. I estimate their speed at about a half arc-minute per second. They stayed like that for about 2-3 seconds and were just below the galaxy.  Then the lower, second light accelerated slightly ahead of the first and then their trajectories started diverging with the lower light rapidly turning downward out of the FOV (eastward) while the top light started slowly rising (westward) out of the FOV.  Needless to say I was amazed at what I was seeing and was yelling to the rest of the crowd (some with binoculars) to quickly look at M31.  I was in a quandary as to which light to follow and I was wildly swinging from one diverging light to the other until I lost both.  Since I has lost them in the binoculars, I tried to see if I could see something with just my eyes.  I could not see anything near M31.  Limiting magnitude that night was the typical 6.1 for this location.  I am familiar with the behaviour of satellites as this is a very common sight at Pinos with the ISS, Intelsat, HST and Iridium constellation commonly visible.  It was not an Iridium satellite since the lights maintained their magnitude at all times with no dimming or brightening.  It was not any of the common satellites who usually have a much larger visual magnitude and always maintain the same speed and direction across the sky.  The lights had a much greater speed than other satellites that I have observed.  I have never witnessed a satellite changing accelerations and directions.  There were only the single points of white light. I don&apos;t think they could have been extreme high altitude aircraft since I would think the only visible light from such aircraft would be their exhaust jet which at my observing location would have have been oblique to me.  Also if this was common high altitude aircraft then their speeds would have had to be very great at this long distance to account for my observations of extreme accelerations.  At this time I don&apos;t know what I observed.  Experimental military spacecraft or vehicles of LGM, I don&apos;t know, first time I saw anything out of the ordinary in the night sky. At least I have a story to tell now when the conversation turns to observed wierdness.", "I was watching a movie late at night on TV when all the power and lights went off.

There are no planes, Shuttle Craft, Or anything else that has been invented that i know of that looks any thing like what i saw.

It had a difference about it that i have never come across again.As it crossed away from the right hand side of the car i caught a breef glims of something glowing green moveing away over a slight hill the glims only lasted a few seconds. By the time i stoped the car and got out it had vanished, Myself and my friend just stood there with no explaination as to what had just happened I asked if he&apos;ed seen it, He said he had,We were amased but only stayed a few minutes at the place and drove on, its odd but i dont realy remember us haveing much to say about it as we drove to the coast were we saw it again, It must have been fifteen or twenty minutes later when we got to the beach i had stoped and parked the car and was eager to get out of it and look at the sky it was a very clear night with very little cloud and as i looked out over the sea i saw it, it must have been a few miles out and hovering over the sea, It was a green ball of light, pure green light,It held there for a couple of seconds two at the most and then in a flash it raced acrossed the sea and it was gone.My friend said he only saw a flash of green light at the horizon as he got out of the car. I swear that this sighting is true, It has left me hopeing that in my lifetime it will be proved that were not alone in this universe that there is life on other planets, Hopefully not too much longer, I cant see how it can be hidden any more.

It was 0300 Mexaco time. I looked out of the port hole in my state room and saw 3 what appeared to be lights in a straight line just below the water surface. I made sure all the lights in my state room were off because I wanted to eliminate any reflections. They were keeping pace with the ship and right below my port hole window. After approx. 10 min. they began to head away from the ship as if to go around the bow. I was on the starboard side of the ship and we were headed north by north/east. They headed tword the horizon at  45degrees away from the ship and they were still under water. As they got closer to the horizon I lost sight of them. I continued to look tword the direction they were headed. All of a sudden I saw three lights above the horizon and they were going straight up. They continued to climb straight up for I would say approx. 5000&apos; or 10,000&apos; then they did a hard 90degree left turn parallel the horizon. When I saw then turn the first thing that crossed my mind was &quot;come back&quot;. When I thought this the three lights (in a straight line) reversed direction at a very rapid speed. The lights then formed a perfect triangle as they appeared to gain altitude from the previous turn. They dissapeared after making the triangle pattern. The time between the hard left turn, and the triangle dissapearing was approx. 25 to 30 seconds.

I make it a habit to turn all of the outdoor lighting off for better viewing with my telescope. The event began at 3:30 am in Montgomery, Alabama with a single, low altitude object arriving from the northwest and becoming stationary. I immediately realized the craft was not a plane, helicopter or anything I recognized because of it&apos;s coloration and behavior. Minutes later, other objects began to eminate from the first object in all directions at different intervals. All of the other objects were similar in shape and light features to the first object, just smaller. Then the show began. The objects in total were too numerous to count and performed spectacular aerial manuevers for two solid hours. My wife, who also witnessed the event, and I were exhilerated beyond description. Neither of us have ever witnessed such a massive UFO event before and I can assure you that we were completely mesmerized.

I work in the airline industry and have spent many nights on the ramp.  I know airplane landing light formations for just about every type of aircraft.  This was no aircraft.  The second event were flares dropped over the Gila mountains.  They acted exactly like flaires and it is my opinion that they were dropped to confuse everyone from the first event.  I lived in Phoenix for 10 plus years and never were flares dropped from that position at night.  Sky Harbor is not far away and never once were flares dropped at night.  It would freak the passengers out if they saw something like that while landing.  Even the Marines in Yuma draw attention if they practice at night.

White light seen moving at quick paceThis is the second day in a row that a UFO was spotted over Indiana, PA around 9PM EST. Friday night Aug 11th 2006 we went to leave my house to go for a walk as we normally do on weekend nights. Upon leaving the house I spotted a very bright light over the east horizion. from my location appeared to be 2 inches from the horizion at about a 30 degree angle from my location and it probably was over a mile in the distance (numbers are a pure estimate, unsure of real distance, height, and angle it wsa at from my location) at first I thought it was an airplane going in for a landing at Jimmy Stewart Airport, which was very near where the object was spotted. However, the object stayed in a fixed location for 10 minutes. Upon noticing this we decided to go find out what it was. We got into my car and proceeded to drive up Highway 119 but did not take the Clymer exit which would take you to the airport. I continued to drive down 119 and saw the object again after about traveling 1 mile down 119. It appeared to be in the same location still, but not sure exactly how far it was from me. We did notice at this point the object was moving, it appeared to be traveling parallel to my car as it traveled down 119. I was headed in the direction of punxsutawney, PA. At this point we slowed down and came to a stop off the sholder of the highway and the object was moving at a quick pace then came to an abrupt stop. I figured I would get back to the airport and see if I could get closer. I turned down the first exit I could find and continued back to downtown Indiana. At this point we lost track of the object because of our location. Upon getting back on to Philadelphia St and proceeding east back towards 119 I took the clymer exit this time and headed towards the airport. When we got there we did not see anything in the sky and decided to return home to see if we could see anything there. At home there was nothing to bee seen, however I noticed an interesting vapor trail in the sky that looked like no plane one I have ever seen. It moved in a very defined line and make very quick turns in a very large S shape from what appeared to be from where we originally saw the object directly over our location and through where town is. I compared them to other vapor trails created by planes that night and compareing the rate of disipation of a known plane one to this, this trail had to of been made very quickly to maintain its definition over that large of a distance. Although a little freaked out we proceeded to go to town to do our walk. At around 9:55 PM while walking down church st facing west we noticed a very similar bright object in the sky. I stopped and watched it closely lineing it up with a power line to detect movement, and it was either riseing in the air or coming towards us relatively quickly. I pulled out my camera phone to try to take a picture and it just flicker out and was now not visible again. We continued to walk towards the Sheetz convienance store near Indiana University of Pennsylvania at this point and the object was lit up again. Once again it was moving towards us at a relatively quick pace. My girlfriend at this point was getting very scared and we decided to get into Sheetz as fast as possible. We ran towards other people who were walking in that direction to at least be near others, at this point the light just flashed out again. We spent about 8 minutes in sheetz before deciding to get back to my car and drive back home, the car was about 3/4ths a mile from where we were now. We started to walk up 6th st towards downtown Indiana and while doing this in the same location in the sky looking towards Indiana Mall the light just flashed back on again and was moving once again. We moved quickly into town which a festival was going on at the time, so there were lots of people around. At this point we lost track of the object so moved quickly to my car, which was in my work&apos;s parking lot about 1/4th a mile away Quickly got home, where the light appeared again over the hill behing my house. At this time I pointed it out to my mother, sister, her boyfriend and her friend. We watched the object for about another 10 minutes as it randomly got bright, dim and eventually disappeared. This is the second night in a row an object was in the skys. The night before (Thursday night) we had a tringular large UFO fly directly over our house at a quick pace, but slow enough to watch it for 30 seconds in detail. The objects seem to always appear in the summer around 9PM in august. It is the only similarity to all the objects I&apos;ve seen in the past few years here, but they are definatly appearing more often now the ever before.", "Lenticular, domed, saucer lit with many lights in level flight, pilot visible.((name deleted)), age 6, reported a flat bottom, lenticular, domed disk in straight, level flight from North to South over the West end of Fullerton, CA in June of 2006.

Through front room window facing East I saw a bright Eliptical shaped light low in the Eastern sky just above neighbor&apos;s roof. Resembled aircraft with red and green running lights. Saw red and green light in flashes. Object was not travelling across sky but appeared stationary.Ran outside to end of the block at Esperanza Blvd. and W. Paseo Solana to observe looking Northeast. Object Rose almost imperceptibly slowly in the sky to a greater height gradually changing shape and size,to a round shape,the back to somewhat of an elipse, growing smaller and larger and smaller again (very slowly)  until it appeared to my perspective as a pinpoint of light, like a large star. At this point I saw that there was another identical craft in a line directly beneath the first one but at a lower altitude.These lights did not pulse but remained at a steady luminosity. Second craft only observed during the pinpoint of light phase. Second craft was observed for a good period of time and was definitely present and was not a reflection or trick of the light.Importantly, My position was in very close proximity to the Mt. Whipple observatory atop Mt. Hoplins,directly to the South. Running lights were no longer able to be observed from my perspective when the craft had reached these higher altitudes. Craft apparently were travelling up and away toward the Northeast from my position, since Light apeared to grow smaller, grow larger, get smaller again and then wink out. Observed phenomenon for a good 10 to fifteen minutes from around 5:05 to 5:20 am from  when I came in and imediately noted my impressions.

Around 7 pm last Saturday, after a 2-hour phone meeting, i noticed a red triangle on my left hand about halfway between the  thumb and the wrist. It looked like a burn. The triangle is exactly 1&quot; wide on bottom side and 3/8&quot; from the center of this side to the top with both ends narrowing into a perfectly very thin point, particularly visible on the left (wrist) side. It looks just like a UFO! The  triangle seems burned on the skin but there is no pain, heat or blistering.  The bottom of the triangle (the widest side) looks or appears slightly curved down just like the shape of a craft seen in profile.

I noticed, over the nearby parallel north-south runways, a very small black object moving in a straight line under the clouds going in a direction from northwest to southeast ..perhaps at an altitude of 1000 to 2000 feet...its speed was that of a slow moving airplane not a jet...but not as slow as a bird...The winds were gusting to 35mph which I had checked on our company&apos;s weather information page prior to taking the elevator to the top floor of the building and the airport was closed at this time for takeoffs and landings. The clouds were literally swirling in 3 directions overhead and windshear must have been pretty strong  ...all air traffic on the ramp had come to a halt and no planes were landing.  This object was big enough to be noticeable but too small to determine the exact shape which was so frustrating though I want to say that it did not look aerodynamic for some reason.  There was no wing flapping motion and even though one of my friends told me it had to be a bird, I&apos;m not certain a bird could hold it course going through a severe thunderstorm without being tossed around or altering its flight path . I would think at this point it would be blown all over the place as even we were being buffeted and pushed around by the winds. Nor could a bird traverse the entire airport In 1 minute as it had crossed the field in a straight line neither moving up or down and as it traversed the airport going south east I could see that the object neither moved to the right or left but continued on this straight axis to the end of the cloud build up....possibly 2 miles away then swung up at the end of the cloud bank and went into the upper clouds in an extreme parabolic path....its flight path was neither typical of a bird or a plane. 1 thing was puzzling and that was even when it was at its closest to terminal A we could not make out its shape yet even when it was far away we could still see the black object....", "When I saw the object it was not moveing, then it went stright down and stoped, then it went up at 45 degree angal  to the left and stoped, then went over to the right at a 90 degres angle were it stoped half way from the first time it went stright down.

But these craft are training over our skies every night of the week (Exept Sundays) in Sacramento CA. Up in the foothills and the Sierra Nevada range we can see them in formations of two, four, and six over the Central valley. I think it&apos;s because we are at a higher elevation. I THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT TO MAKE THIS A WHITE WORLD PROJECT. They are operating without regard to who is watching them. I believe they are manned craft as opposed to UAV&apos;s.They look a bit like bright stars and Planets at first and tend to wobble a bit when you look at them. But watch for the red tail of light followed by a range of colors that sparkle off the craft. Usually they work in groups of 2 and can sit still for hours, only to move as quickly as 50 thousand miles per hour in a second. One night I watched as more than 8 gathered in a circle in the sky. A lone craft then dotted in and out of visibility across the sky. Each time it reappeared it did so it came back with a flash of light. Almost like a &quot;Top Gun&quot; Training flight.I don&apos;t believe that these are UFO&apos;s. These craft are US Military in their training style and seem to be guarding our coastline as well.

The characteristics that were most interesting is it was round (looked like an aspirin pill), shined like chrome and moved at incredible speed.  I&apos;ve seen jets move before and this was no jet, it would be going like Mach 7.  When it was close by, if you calculate by distance at 2000 ft from us, it must have been like 200 ft in diameter.

Mommy, do you see it?&rdquo; she asked, I replied, &ldquo;I sure do&rdquo;. This bright orange light just sat there not moving &ndash; and not making any sort of noise. I can safely saw that the size of the light was the size of a quarter from where we sat. We watched it for a couple of minutes until it seemed to &ldquo;dim away&rdquo; as though it was going straight up.

This smoke trail was (30,000ft Plus)very high in the sky.  Then the smoke started to disappearing (the was alot of stars and it was a clear sky.)

Spires with lights on them appeared to jut out from it&apos;s left side.  It was a clear night -44 Degrees Below Zero.  There was a slight breeze moving from left to right of viewing plane.  I estimate the breeze moving from East to West.  We were looking south from the parking lot.  The object hovered silently and stayed stationary regardless of the breeze.  After about 5-10 minutes the object began to move slightly toward the right of the viewing plane.  The object then stopped again and remained stationary.  While observing it I waited for ((name deleted)) to see it since I did not want to imply what I was seeing.  He then looked up where I was looking and asked, &quot;What the hell is that?&quot;  Be both observed it for a few more minutes then both decided to go home.  He drove up to murphy Dome Road and said it was no longer in his sight. The object stayed stationary as we both went home.  The object was in my path as I drove home, moving toward it, so I watched it as I was driving home looking to see if it would get any bigger.  I am still not sure if it did get any bigger.  Later measurements seem to indicate that it did appear larger at my appartment.  At my appartment, I observed the object from my balcony and still was trying to explain it away.  I convinced myself that it was lights from a far away building I never knew existed before, and had a feeling that it would be there in the morning.  However, I convinced myself of this in spite that I knew it was a wrong assumption.  This was because the structure of the placement of the lights were sort of in a random pattern of distribution and that I had seen it moving. I had a camera with me but assumed that it would be there in the morning.  I went to bed, due to exaustion, after 30 minutes had elapsed from the initial sighting to the balcony sighting even thought the object was still visible.    So my visual sighting took only about 30 minutes. However, after a conversation with a Physics Personnel at the University of Alaska, Geophysical Institute, we obtained infrasound readings of what may be the object.  The infrasound readings indicate that there might have been an engine signature on Atmospheric Entry and then another signature on Exiting the Earths Atmosphere.  The infrasound readings obtained sounds well below human hearing levels.  Anyhow, two distinct readings do exist that happen to be approximately 45 minutes apart.

Exact date may be a week sooner or later, not too sure of that but it was early samll game hunting season then. 3 of us were bird hunting in the area and it was getting dark fast. Done, and heading home, we stopped just to watch flocks of ducks landing in the (sanctuary) ponds to the south/south west of our position on the road. Overcast, maybe 2,500 feet with a steady wind from west as I remember. During some of the joking and talking, I saw bright magenta (red) light descend straight down, unaffected by wind and with no smoking trail or sound, to the ground by the pond in front of the tree line slightly to the west of where we were looking and maybe 1/4 mile away, a good guess. It was a brilliant light with kind of a haze surrounding it. Size is hard to say...maybe from basketball to large beach ball in size. As it got closer to the ground it actually slowed down and the light turned off. I assume it was on the ground in tall grasses etc. That is when I mentioned it to the others because they were looking back in my direction as I recall. Maybe 5 minutes went by, after swapping a few more stories, I saw the light turn on again and pointed at it...this time all 3 of us saw it ascend straight up, very fast, no sound, no smoke, no wings, no rotor blades, nothing but brilliant pure silent magenta light accelerating into the clouds, seemingly immune to the effects of the wind. Now that is what got my curiosity going, you know, something coming down and soft landing then, later, taking off at an incredible speed all with no sound and in a wooded/marshy area. We were close enough to hear ducks making noise but that thing was silent. The other 2 weren&apos;t all that interested after seeing it, and I never thought about it again until a few years ago. As a former pilot I can say that it did not look like aerodynamic flight and so I do not know what it was. Thinking about it now, that was not a good &apos;alternate landing site&apos; for any aircraft for any reason.

I was alittle shocked as I didn&apos;t really think that it would really work. But it did! The quiet ball of hovering light was gone! I quickly looked at my friend who was &quot;coming out of it&quot; and I was truely shook up. He was fine. I asked him if he &quot;saw&quot; the noiseless light in the sky. He said he did. Then I asked him how?-- as he never was able to physically look up and &quot;see&quot; anything due to his incapcitation. He said that he didn&apos;t know how --but he felt that he did somehow &quot;see&quot; it. I on the other hand &quot;saw&quot; everything and I didn&apos;t like any of it! It just wasn&apos;t right.

In the summer heat we typically go out late and fly until dusk. Naturally we are looking up at the sky as it darkens. One day last week we are flying, and my friend Jim asks me &quot;what is that bright planet overhead.&quot; I look up and see a &quot;star&quot; a couple fists width due west of Zenith that has to be as bright as Venus at sunset.  But, I know there is no star or planet that bright in that part of the sky.  So, I tell my friend that I have no idea; maybe an iridium satellite?  After a while, my friend says the &quot;satellite&quot; hasn&apos;t moved, and I take my eyes off my plane as long as I dare to confirm that no movement is detectable. We decide that we just don&apos;t know....maybe it is a slow moving satellite that we have no sky reference to detect motion. As it darkens, the star/satellite disappears, and we don&apos;t say anymore about it. On Tuesday, August 15, at 7:50pm CDT, my friend calls me on the phone and tells me &quot;that thing&quot; is back in the sky, and &quot;in the same place.&quot;  I go out on the deck, and there it is again...same light, same brightness, same place...best as I can tell. I laid my back down on the house deck and aligned the object with a mark on the handrail to see if I could detect motion....I couldn&apos;t. I&apos;m interested, so, I ran into the house to get the binoculars. Outside with the binos 15 seconds later, I lay down on the deck to steady myself, focus, and....I can resolve a disk at 10x;...circular and bright, definitely not stellar in any case. Reminds me of Jupiter through a low power view, perhaps 50 arcseconds in diameter to show a disk at such low power.  Now I&apos;m really interested, except that the binoculars fogged up in the humidity in just a half minute, and I can&apos;t see anymore. So, I trot off to the shed thinking of what instrument I could grab for a quick view and mentally settle on 80mm f/5 &quot;shorty&quot; refractor that is mounted on a Bogen camera tripod and ready to snatch and view. It takes about 10 seconds to get to the shed door, and as I look up to fix the object from that location, it is completely gone.  The object dropped from what was probably about -3 to -4 visible magnitude to absoutely nothing. Phone rings...it&apos;s my flying friend, and I know what he&apos;s going to say....he has a telescope and says that he had the object sighted in the viewfinder, but when he looked into the 40x eyepiece...it was gone.

On July 4, 2006, the space shuttle Discovery took off at 2:37 PM. I wasn&apos;t in a good spot to see the launch (trees in the way), so about ten minutes before the shuttle took off, I started driving from Deltona looking for a unobstructed view of the east.  I was hoping to get to the St. Johns River bridge along 415 and pull over there to watch the shuttle since there would be no obstructions over the river.  I didn&apos;t make it that far, and at 2:37 I pulled over into a church parking lot in Osteen that had an open field behind it. By the time I got my camera out, the shuttle was probably about 30 seconds into it&apos;s launch.  I started taping the launch, and once the shuttle was no longer visible, I noticed something else in the sky. It was round black object up in the sky off in the distance in the same direction that the shuttle took off from.  Judging from the clouds that the shuttle passed behind, and what the object was in front of, the black object was closer than the shuttle, but it was hard for me to estimate a size.  My initial though was that somebody released a balloon that was rising.  After watching the object a bit, I realized it wasn&apos;t moving correctly to be a balloon.  For example, it would be at one spot in the sky, and then would move back and forth horizontally.  Another time it started getting low in the sky rather quickly compared to the speed that it was drifting at at other times.  It also appeared to be just barely entering clouds at times.  It would fade behind a cloud, but never actually disappear totally. I watched (and video taped) the object for about 10 minutes until I finally left.  About 5 minutes later, I was able to look past the trees after driving along 415 in the direction of Sanford and still see the object. Later on, as I am writing this, I looked at the video that I took of the object and the shuttle launch.  At one point I am not paying attention, and move the camera off of the shuttle, and the object shows up there showing that the object was in the sky before I noticed it too.

We slowed the video down to a crawl and watched several small flying craft, that looked a lot like flying oreo cookies.A few seconds later this large &quot;line&quot; of lights showed up, the way the light hit it a few times made it go from translucent to kind of a plasma looking thing, all that was really clear were the lights. using zoom, we were able to see it was rotating, and the lights were actually pale shades of green pink and yellow, alternating as it spun around.  It didnt fly straight, rather jumped around, the smaller craft looked like they were trying to &quot;stir&quot; up the air to keep the larger craft concealed.

There was a glow of light around the object that was nearly three to four times the size of the actual light itself, but I suspect that this was due to the clouds. The object did not change course or move from a straight line and I quickly lost sight of it as it went behind some trees that line the street. I only saw the object through the front windshield of my vehicle as I was driving, it started out near the middle of the left side of my windshield and moved to the upper right side of my windshield over the 5 seconds or so that I saw it.

Cars would pass by maybe every 15 or 20 mins...As it got fully dark, my husband and I, are our two older sons, got on top of our van, and just started stargazing.  There was a bit of a lighting storm off to the west, miles away...over what had to be the Nellis/Area 51 area...we watched a bit of that...but directly over us was just a few clouds, lots of stars.What we saw, we thought was a star, it seemed very high up, but seemed to be going very fast.  Then another and another... every several minutes, we&apos;d see another. They&apos;d go in different directions, always silent, most seemed very high up.  Several planes were going by, but they had strobes,and the different colored lights on them, these were just white like stars in the distance.  We watched for irrational patterns, but all seemed to go in straight lines, or only turn slightly. The most at one time we saw was 3, and ONE was different than the rest...it seemed very LOW, the light was very bright, it came from the west, moving east, and went right over us.  You could see no shapes, hear no noise..just a light, it turned to go more toward the south, and then just disappeared...  we&apos;d watch them all until they&apos;d fade out that way.We hung out about 2 hours...counted 9 of them...", "I  have to report this because it has been bothering me for several month&apos;s.I was a foreman at Norsk Hydro Aluminum plant during this sighting. I had steped out back for a cigarett in our break area. I was the only one outside, at the time. I looked up in the sky due to the 3 bright lights catching my eye.The 3 light&apos;s were in a triangle shape, at least, 3 football field&apos;s  in length.What ever it was it was moving very slow at a low altitude. What really freaked me out, is that there was a hugh disipation of vapor coming out from the thing. However this lasted only a few second&apos;s. This was not an airplane or any type of helecoptor.I believe the ship was cloaked as i could not see the actual ship. I believe cloaking is possible, starting with Project Rainbow, back in 1941.The next thing i noticed was a strange round multicolor light in front of the craft.The light expanded as fireworks explod and the craft was gone.People think i am crazy, however i know what i saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There was no sound, no flashing/blinking lights, but while it flew it seemed as if it were shaking or moving in a side to side manner, while still continuing in the nw-se direction.  There were 7 of us who watched this (5 adults, 2 children). Us adults were quite amazed and it left us all wondering what it was we had just seen.  I can tell you that we are all 100% sure this was not any firework, or anything of that matter. There were hundreds of people in the vicinity and we are hoping that someone else has seen the same thing we did and will report it as well.", "The begining of the lights in the nightStrange thing is, this is a family story. I do recall the events, which started this extraordinary set of events in motion.  Those images are not something you forget.  I know it was tax season because we were returning from my uncles (he did taxes pretty well) and my father got his taxes done that evening.  We were on our way home, which takes us down county line road, then turn right, then half mile and turn right on to CR173.  We lived about a mile from the turn onto 173.  Well as we were turning, my mother who was also a witness, noticed a bright white oval/almost cylindrical shaped object above what we called (for sake of this report we will call them the X woods) &quot;X Woods&quot; (the X&apos;s owned the entire chunk of real estate).  Within a matter of seconds, of us all looking to see what my mother had seen, I was thrown backwards with the great acceleration of the car.  When I got back to see what the speed was I remember clearly it was bouncing off the little bar at the end of the speedometer. The speedometer registered 120mph max.  It took us mere seconds, even with a 90 degree left turn into our driveway (driveway is about .5miles in length) this with 3 young kids, and an infant in the front.We were rushed into the house, rushed into our bed cloths, and carted off to bed.  I remember hearing the shotgun being prepped and loaded, and remember for 3 days we didn&apos;t go to school, nor were we permitted to play outdoors, and my father set with a loaded double barrel shotgun on the front porch for3 nights. Beings I was a kid I had no worries, I just did was I was told, and complained about not being able to go outside.This object appeared 9 other times in my life.  I have seen this object up close; I bare scars, burns, illnesses, and other strange marking from events which to this day still occur with frightening regularity. I have been witness to other events outside my purview (happening as I just came in on it or happened to have been present during it).  The object I saw was brilliant, but not so that you couldn&apos;t look at it.  It shined what looked like today&apos;s laser pens at several locations, however the beam was much larger, and more intense. The beams did not shine directly at us however, but there were several noticeable points of contact.  A tree near our home had been singed, a barn roof had its roofing tar burned to a crisp, and our neighbors lost 2 of their horses due to breaking of a fence, which was also burned (horses later recovered 2 miles from their origin location), the X&apos;s recall nothing of the event whatsoever. However their trees were also singed or burned and their driveway showed evidence of burning.This was all quickly forgotten by the X&apos;s and the like in the area as this was real rural farm country. From my bedroom window we could see the object thru the tree in the front yard for an additional 15-20 minutes.  This object appeared twice more over the next days.  Each time progressively shorter in stay, the final night was its shortest stay, this time however it was in the field to the south of the woods, and appeared much lower to the ground, 20-30 feet above the empty field.  Later descriptions by my father confirmed this.  He said it just sat there silent.  This time no lights came from the object like it had done the previous 2 nights.  He said it seemingly sat there, which was confirmed by my brother and I who were up way past our bedtime sneaking peaks out the front window.  The last night after hovering for only a few moments it shot straight up, it changed colors from white to orange, then to blue, and was gone.My father went to the site in the early morning of the 4th day, and found absolutely nothing.  No burn marks, singing, or anything out of the ordinary.  However he did notice the air seemed electrically charged and had the smell of ozone. This incident wouldn&apos;t be so memorable had it not happened right in front of me.  To this date no other member of my family will discuss this matter.  My father and mother have now passed on, and the remaining witnesses to the event refuse to speak of it. If there were other witnesses to the event none to date have come forward.  I stand alone in this matter.  Basically because it&apos;s not something you talk about except around campfires and the like. I have asked my brother and sister who were in the backseat with me if they would care to comment.  Their answers were outright NO COMMENT, so I will leave it at that.My postulations on what this object might have been go from a helicopter, military aircraft, to swamp gas, to UFO, to god knows what. I wouldn&apos;t even bring it to your attention had these events not continued in my life.  I have contacted other UFO organizations, and author Bud Hopkins in regards to the many events in my life.  To date only one, ARC (Alternate Realities Conference) in Johnson City Tennessee has any interest in this information.   I wrote to them of my happenings over the entirety of my life. No one else has shown interest other then those I tell around the proverbial campfire, and even then those stories are soon forgotten.   I can only postulate that the reason my father hit the gas was that he had seen this object sometime before, and was afraid of it.  The shotgun and the porch sitting was another indicator that he was afraid of it.  My mother&apos;s response was extremely similar.  They were afraid of whatever it was. I myself at that time had no opinion of it, not till it affected me later in life.  Thanks for your time today.", "White light, zig zagged across the sky, shot out, stopped then started to blink in colors.I was outside of the van we were camping in out side a friends house. My girlfriend and her friend were inside the van. I have seen on four seperate occations U.F.O&apos;s, but never had I had a wittness. I thoght I was going crazy. This was different. I looked up seen what looked likr it could have been a Plane. After a few seconds I could tell it was different, It was about 45 degrees above the horizon line. It moved from SW to NW. I told the girls to come and take a look. We all seen the light. It was not bliking and it was bright. It zig zaged, or quivered or something. Then it stopped for about a second. Then, at a very high rate of speed, it shot out into space. ust before it was out of sight it stopped again. It stayed there and started to blink red, blue, and I think white. It sat there for 20 mins. WE RAN DOWN THE STREET TO GET A BETTER VIEW. After a while we wondered what we shold do. Then we did noting and went to bed. It&apos;s funny when you see something so amazing your brain can&apos;t get around it. The next day we talked about it, but daylight somehow made our story seem foolish.

Looked up, saw a shooting star, decided to look for a few minutes to see if I could see more.  Then, directly overhead, I noticed three star-like objects in triangle formation moving south to north. I had originally been unsure whether I was seeing one large triangular object or three separate objects.   Then I noticed that I could see stars between the moving objects and decided that they must be separate objects.  Also, after that determination was made, at least one of the objects made very quick movements out of the formation, then back in, although the triangle was not the same shape afterwards. The triangle kind of bent and warped as it moved, so I surmise that all of the objects were probably moving in varying patterns. I looked for any signs of strobes or running lights, but found none. This was a very strange feeling to see this.  The fluid motion of the triangle gave the feel that these things could just move any way they wanted to. As for the size, the objects were about as large and the same brilliance as a star.  The triangle they formed itself approximately as wide as my fist when I held up my outstretched arm. Whatever they were, they were way way up there.   No sound.  No lights. I would have thought they were maybe satellites or something.  But moving around like that, I really don&apos;t think so. Now, I know a lot of people are going to probably say these were planes or jets, since I do live in the flight path of a major airport about 40 miles away (DFW).  But I am telling you this were not planes.  They just did not move like that, the snakelike movement of them individually, making that triangle fluid. From the time I saw them directly overhead till I lost them in the city lights to the north, was about 4 or 5 minutes.  I would say that I watched them from about 90 degrees to about 60 degrees before I lost them in the lights. Very strange.", "phoenix lights over san diegothis is just an update to what i saw back in march 13 1997..it was when i lived in san diego,,and during the night around 8 or 9 as i was heading to the garage to watch t.v. i saw 24 red lights,,,but not that bright...there was two formation of light 12 lights to each formation...each formation was slightly over lapping each other from the middle,,kind of like the olympic symbols except only 2 but lying flat in the sky...plus i could make out the stars threw each formation,,but im still not sure if this formation was solid,,,just the lights,,that were 200 yards above and slightly right of my grandparents house....what i saw that night was totally stunning,,,plus my friend had the chance to encounter these red lights too!!!.the really stunning thing about all this was that all together the lights were in the sky for 20 minutes and suddenly one by one each light from the middle outwards went out like a light switch except only 2 lights were left in the sky....the 2 lights that were left were the out side lights from each each formation,,,the two lights started flying towards each other at a low rate of speed and came together to make one light.this one light slowly started blinking,,,the rate of blinking was slower then that of most aircraft on board lights,,anyway&apos;s this slow blinking red light took off really slow away from us over the hills and towards the ocean,never to be seen again by me or my friend,,until i saw on unsolved mystery&apos;s about the &quot;phoenix light&quot;,,when i saw that i freaked out because i thought until then that only me and my friend saw that kind of formation!!! i was wrong!,,,but i get mad because people always make a huge deal aboutwhat happened in phoenix,,maybe because more people seen the red lights!!!,but now i had seen them over are house in and over the sky&apos;s of san diego!!.", "Bright lights over Fewrris Texas that disapear in secondsWe where driving home from dallas to athens we decided to go down hwy 45 to go home instead of our normal route.

He lives on New Holland Road on the north side of Holland Michigan. Holland is located on the west side of the state of Michigan and is right on the Lake Michigan coast line. My friends house is about a 5 minute drive to the coast line. He has about 9 acres in a relatively undeveloped area of town with very few lights obstructing the evening sky. We were just looking at the stars and as I looked at the western sky (toward Lake Michigan)  I saw a very bright shining light. This light appeared white and bright. It shimered at times. I did not see where it came from or how it got to that point in the sky. I called my friends attention to it and he immediately thought it was very odd. We both have spent many evenings enjoying the stars and late night skies over his property and have seen airplanes and helecopters on a number of occassions. What struck us as odd was it seemed close. Eventhough it appeared low out over the western horizon as if it were a plane at +20,000 feet coming over the lake (which is common) the lights seem as if they were no farther than a mile away over an area used for agricultural purposes. The light kind of hung there with a shimering effect. It was moving and eventualy approached my friends property roughly flying in a westerly to easterly direction. As it slowly moved just north of our position we did see a few lights on the object. We saw a red light additional white light and a green light. This brought up the brief discussion that it could simply be a plane with red and green navigation lights but their were still some oddities to this object. First- it still appeared to be very close. Lets say...less than a mile and looked to be no more than a one thousand feet (at most) in the air. Second - other than some distant highway traffic sounds it is relatively quiet at my friends property. As I said earlier...we have watched many airplanes and helecopters fly throughout this airspace many times. The difference is that this object made NO noise. We ussually can hear planes and other aircraft for miles and even when they are 20,000 feet in the air. We kept listening for the noise and nothing. As it passed us by heading in a easterly direction it made a slight direction change heading slightly northeast.Still no sounds. It eventually disappeared from our view over the horizon. It could have been an airplane but the shimering lights, close proximity/elevation and apparent lack of sound left us a bit bewildered. This is the first time that we both felt that we may have seen a UFO.", "Five objects in sky around LaGuardia airport, N.Y.C., daylight.I was on break when i noticed a bright point of light (silvery)in a northern position over LaGuardia airport.

It was like light reflecting off a metal surface. The light was flickering and then the two other objects were in focus. The objects remained in a stationaty position.A few minutes following this two other objects also appeared to the east of the three objects.

The speed of the object was slow as if it was taking it&apos;s time with, the remaining objects holding their position.After whatching the moving object I looked back at the remaining objects and another object took up the position to form the triangle with the formation now smaller. Following this cloud cover moved in and I lost the oblects above the clouds.At the time of the sightings the sky was clear with unlimited visibility.

The brightness was about the same as 2nd magnitude stars, consisting of 5 to 6 lights in a perfect V shaped formation.   One of my fellow observers described it as a giant bird shaped object.  The field of view was about 100 degrees across the sky and this distance was covered in 3 to four seconds, again north to south in a straight line.  I cannot even estimate the altitude but gut feeling says several hundred thousand feet and several thousands of miles per hour.  I am a private pilot and amateur astronomer.  We were observing several meteorites on this evening when the event occured.  The event was creepy as I&apos;ve never witnessed such an event before but have heard of them.

I know that there was a move with your organization and it may have gotten lost.  This report or near version of it has also been submitted to ufo evidence.After attending a Traverse City West High School game during the fall of 2001 I got gas from the local gas station and traveled up Barnes Road heading west from Traverse City.  At the top I stopped at the stop sign and looking west over the tree line I could see bright lights coming in rather low.  My first impression is that it&apos;s an airliner coming in to Cherrry Capital Airport.  It did although seem rather bright and quite low.  I then took a right hand turn, a left onto Harris and then another left onto Cedar Run.  After about 2 miles I came to the top of a hill that overlooks the Cedar Run Golf Course.  At the top of the hill looking towards the southwest I could see a very bright airborne object.  This object was very large and emitted brilliant white light. As I traveled down the hill towards the object in my mind I tried to figure out what it could be.  I knew it wasn&apos;t an airplane because it was not moving, this object was just hovering above the golf course.  I knew it was not a helicopter because it was to large, about the size of a 747.  At the bottom of the hill and coming up next to the golf course I slowed down and rolled down the window.  I could not hear a sound and this is when I started to get scared because I did not know what it was and I had my four year old son in the van with me.The object was just over full grown sugar or red maple trees about 250 feet off the ground. The object was 150 to 200 feet long, 20 to 30 feet tall and probably within 600 yards.I continued west on Cedar Run over a hill and 2 people were standing outside looking in the direction of the craft.  I didn&apos;t want to stop because it was still to close and I was afraid.I have stopped at 3 houses since the episode and no one could recall the event.  The people at the house that were looking towards the golf course have since moved. I learned of this just a couple of weeks ago.What impressed me most about this object was the lack of sound for it&apos;s size.  I should have heard something. Also, at no point did I see it move, although I saw this object at 2 different locations.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Slow-moving bright lights in V shape seen from Corbett, OregonThe event occured sometime between 3:45 am and 4:10 am on Tuesday Jluy 25th, 2006, witnessed from Corbett, Oregon. I was laying in a field looking at the stars when I noticed what at first seemed a very bright V-shaped grouping of stars. The lights were bright, well defined and clear like LED lights, with the point of the V being the brightest. I realized that this cluster of lights was moving very slowly. I don&apos;t recall seeing a definitive shape other than the lights, so that is why I say it could have been between 1 and 7 objects. But the lights did move exactly together, so they seemed attached to a body.Like a flashlight in the distance, I noticed one of the side lights seemed to be searching, by its growing duller and brighter. But, as I was laying on my back looking up to the sky, I didn&apos;t notice the ground being illuminated and there was no definite beam in the sky. Then it grew extremely bright, and it seemed now pointed directly at me, though I am not sure this is the case. Then the light started flashing at me or in general, in steady strobe pulses. But I can&apos;t say that I, or the ground around me were illuminated. Time is somewhat illusive to me during this, but I don&apos;t think I watched the light flash at me any longer than a minute before I got up, frightened at this point, and left. I have no idea how long the lights stayed, I didn&apos;t go back to look.They were definitely moving very slowly and I think there were seven lights total.I am usually pretty cautious about stories such as this, and only twelve hours later the event seemed too surreal to be true. But I was absolutely awake and aware, during the event, that it was really happening. But I am wondering if anyone else saw this? Hopefully someone did.", "Witnessed two strange white lights in the sky from my home in Sunderland, UKBack in June I reported a UFO to you that turned out to be a Satellite of some sort but now I have seen something that cannot be explained by a Satellite pass as I checked all the times for Satellite passes before I went out Sky watching last night you can find visible passes for my area at the following link -http://heavens-above.com/main.asp?lat=54.911&amp;lng=-1.384&amp;alt=1&amp;loc=Sunderland&amp;TZ=GMT  So I have ruled that explanation out this time and I believe what I saw this time around is definitely something Unknown may be ET but it could also be Natural I don&apos;t know.It was 23 minutes past 11pm on July 15th 2006 and I was conducting a Sky Watching as I normally do when the night&rsquo;s sky is clear.  I looked down to configure my camera on the settings I wanted it on and then turned it off I then looked up to see a light that was brighter than anything else in the sky.  I compared the light to stars in the area and also a plane that I had seen moments before and it was way brighter than anything. It then got even brighter than in initially was to begin with and slowly started to move to the right. I began to get my camera ready when the light slowly began to dim out until it disappeared into seemingly nowhere. I looked around the area but could see absolutely nothing else in the area the only things I could see were stars in the sky and nothing else.  It was a very weird encounter and reminded me of the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; that have been seen over Arizona State, USA for many years now.  But my eventful night was not over just yet, at 5 minutes past midnight I looked up at the sky this time in the opposite direction of the first light this light was much different to the bright one this light was quite dim and looked like an ordinary star but the difference was the object was moving very slowly across the sky I estimate at around 3MPH the object was very small and I got my video camera ready but the light was just not bright enough and I could not see the light in the viewfinder and then the light just disappeared and could no longer be seen. At this point I was getting tired so I ended my sky watch feeling very happy that I had seen a UFO.((e-address deleted))", "3 LIGHTS SEEN IN NIGHT SKYSAW A TRIANGULAR SHAPED CRAFT, 3 OBJECTS AND WAS MOVING ABOUT 10-15 MPH (FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING), HEARD A NOISE BUT NOT LIKE NORMAL AIR-CRAFT.

We were just talking and I happened to look up at the sky. Dusk was just ending and night beginning. The sky was also almost completely cloudy. While I was looking up I noticed a reddish-orange light to the east. It &quot;zoomed&quot; very quickly from the eastern horizon to the western horizon. The closer to the west it got, the more I could see it&apos;s shape...it was somewhat disk-shaped/oval-shaped and glowing a warm orange color. It also left a small trail which I assume was due to its speed and probably a trick on the eyes. Almost to the edge of the western horizon it disappeard in a sort of orangish flash. It was completely silent. I talked to my coworker about it, and she suggested it might have been a shooting-star/meteor. My father is a hobby astronomer so I have seen my share of meteors, even in the daytime...the huge fireball kind. But, this was unlike any &quot;meteor&quot; I&apos;ve ever seen. The way it vanished in a flash of light and the definitive shape of it was interesting. Also, it seemed so close aboved our heads...if a meteor were that close it would have been EXTREMELY bright...and this wasn&apos;t. It was semi-bright and seemed to glow. Plus, if it were a meteor, I would assume that it would have had to be very low for a meteor to be UNDER the clouds. Finally, it didn&apos;t come from an angle...it came horizontally all the way from one horizon to the other. It has always been my dream to become a ufologist...so if this is the real thing...AMAZING.

It instantly zipped away, almost down towards the earth and disapeared. 5 minutes later we also saw some spotlights turn on under where we had seen it, but the spotlights shut off after about 2 minutes.", "holy MOTHERLODE OF A MOTHER SHIPI did a film this morning with my vcr recorder, not a digital, and didnt want to use digital for this past two weeks we did use it, and the pixelization i think gets in the way of the value and stability of the real film of the object. I am speaking of a sighting that my friends and I had of what could only be explained as a UFO.  They told me that they had filmed the incident and I came over to see what they had,  My lead guitar player and myself joined our friend with our own camera the next morning when at approx. 5:15 not only did it do a repeat performance, but it was followed by another craft of approximately the size of 5 football fields.  The smaller craft looked like sparks in the early morning sky, and we didnt even know they were smaller craft until we slowed the film down to frame by frame, and were amazed to see many of them entering and leaving the larger craft.    The air around where they flew seemed to be mixed up like ripples in the water, it was like looking into water, and like someone took a sponge lightly dipped in paint and went over what was really there.  This cloaking activity seems inherent after sunrise, and the only time we have been able to actually SEE them is right at sunrise before the sun rises high enough over head for them to reflect the sky back at themselves.  So I went back again with my digital camera, which has filming capability for short spurts of time, and waited.  I almost thought (even though this was a week later) that I wouldnt see a thing, but right at 5:23 the sun started comingup and there they were , like they appeared out of nowhere, this one took off to the east.  I lost sight of it around Bailey hill, and figured Id have to wait another day, however as I got closer to home, (13 miles away from where we had photographed  them, I went under the train trestle down the street from my house, looked up and bigger than shit there it was.  I barreled down the driveway grabbed my camera and bolted up to the street in time to catch it on an .avi file.   The next day, my friend Bobby calls me and tells me that he caught it landing on the far side of the power plant, the far side of the power plant is delta of the Sacramento River, and an island that is mostly marsh and hazardous waste.  No one goes there, no one human anyway. I figured that since they were appearing close to the power plant that the draw of the electricmagnetic field had to have something to do with them appearing there over and over again.So 4th of July, we went up and w atched fireworks from Bobbys back yard on the top of the hill above Bart in Pittsburg, California,  I took off at about 1 am telling them i was going to get my high powered telescope, my bushnells and my old fashined type of VCR recorder, you know the type that actually took the big VCR tapes to record?  I was back at 4 pm. setting up the telescope and the vcr recorder to watch the sky.  I had a feeling whatever we would see this day was going to be HUGE. and buddy i tell you what it was freaking HUMONGUS.  The size of the city of Concord at the very least. With hudreds of hundreds of the size flying ships that only days before we were referring to as &quot;mother ship&quot;  WHAT A LAUGH!  OH MY GOD.  The video I got of it this morning, actually shows movement on the ship, shows crafts set to depart, on platforms that swing upwards to a sinister or forward slash direction, and when the ships departed, they didnt go straight up, the platform they rested on inclined, and these fast mother flockers left with the force and speed of a projectile,   what looked like might be a jet trail, turned out to be motion blur.  We found all kinds of sparks and fast movement in the sky that many were unable to be seen by the naked eye.  As a matter of fact, when you pointed the camera at them, you could not see the craft on the preview screen of the camera at all, and looking through the eyehole, they werent there either, we had to just point the cameras in the general direction, hit the zoom and width mode and even then sometimes couldnt see them until you slowed the film down by 900 percent.  i AM going to try to translate the film to my computer from the TV somehow and copy it to a DVD.  But I tell you what I am so blown away by the whole thing I dont even know what to think say or do.  The blow away at dawn was looking at what appeared to be an elogated fireball, with the multitude of disks and smaller craft, AND stationary &quot;buildings&quot; with activity able to be seen usning the zoom lense of the camera.  Ill have to enter more on this later.", "Teardrop craft hovered in sky and then darted into a cloud and didn&apos;t come out.Traveling north on I-15, in Utah.  Teardrop shaped object appeared to left of freeway, and appeared to have a very shiny, chromelike surface.  I watched it, trying to figure out what it was as it hovered there in the sky.  Then, after staring at it for about 30 seconds, it darted into a nearby cloud, extrememly fast from a hovering position. I watched the cloud intently for about 30 minutes, wishing it would come out, and it did not. I was not afraid, which surprised me, and found myself just staring and wishing it would come out so I could see it again.  It almost felt like it knew I was watching, and then darted in to a cloud to hide. (Wierd, I know.)

Last night as I was standing outside talking on my cell phone in the driveway.  I looked up and noticed a bright single light moving across the sky at appox: 4-6,000 feet.  I have nicknamed this light &quot;flying silk&quot; because it moves across the sky at a seemingly effortless pace that I would estimate to be about 400MPH.  It emits no noise that I have ever heard, it has no strobes, nor aircraft navigation lights of any kind that I have ever observed. Last nights observation had the object/light moving from Southwest to Northeast almost parrallel to the coast line.  I mentioned it to the person I was talking too on the phone an said something to the effect of &quot;well there it is again&quot; to them.

East to West ... crossed the beach, went out over the Atlantic and went directly into a huge thunderstorm parked off the coast over the water.  Like it was on invisible rails in the sky.

I was around 13 and had been outside with my brother and five other kids. Something told me to run to the bottom of the yard. This is an old railroad town and the lot my house was on was 80X150.   We had been playing in the middle of the yard so I thought it was strange my brain was telling me to go to the back of the yard. But I listened and walked to the  bottom of the yard and stood there. The other kids said, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; I told them I don&rsquo;t know and stood there looking around asking myself why was I suppose to walk down here. Then my brain said, &quot;Look over this way.&quot;  I looked to the left (east) and there I saw half a spot light that seemed to come right out of the mountain top. It was moving in an upward direction, not forward, from a forested area, about 1/4th mile away. This was the beginning of my UFO experience that still disturbs me to this day. I watched as this light rose slightly above the tree tops and turned into a circle. It then proceeded to move forward in my direction. I called the other kids to come see it. They ran down to where I was and we watched this light slowly come right for us. As it got closer I could see two lights, one on top of the other. I thought it was a helicopter, but couldn&rsquo;t see any blades or anything beyond these lights. There was no noise at all. As these lights kept coming right at us, the other kids ran. It appeared that a helicopter was going to land right in our yard. I was the littlest and as I ran up the yard the lights made a turn as if to follow. The other kids were way ahead of me. I could see the blades of grass, this was before dusk.  I made a turn while I was running to go in front of an old garage and to see where the lights went. There above and slightly next to an old oak tree, about 20 feet from the garage, sat a cigar shaped object.. I was stopped in mid run with one foot in front of the other and my arms spread out. I was frozen. I wanted to turn around and see where the other kids went. I couldn&rsquo;t. I couldn&rsquo;t talk. I was petrified and curious at the same time. The last I saw or heard of the other kids besides my brother that night was then when I heard, &ldquo;Do you see that?!&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t believe how the biggest thing in my yard, and old six foot round oak tree, was dwarfed by this object.  It appeared to be made of   brownish, semi-shiny metal. It was not completely smooth. I could see a mottled pattern all over this thing, like you see on some copper or brass ware. There were two triangular lights on the center bottom, facing away from each other, one red, one yellow. It had to be at least 70 feet long and 40 feet across. I stood frozen, trying to figure out what it was. There was no noise at all. The trees leaves right under this thing didn&rsquo;t move at all. There was no heat trail behind it. It just was there, not moving at all like a blimp or helicopter would do. I searched for seams and rivets and bolts, there were none. My brain said this is not natural. So I stood there frozen with my mind racing to explain this thing. Our dog made no noise and hid in the garage.  If I had taken about 8 more steps, I would have been directly under this thing. Then a light opened up from the bottom middle of this object and hit the ground. It was about a 2 feet round, very clean looking spot light. I could see the blades of grass under this thing clearly from the light. This light slowly started to go in a clockwise directional swirl. It was as if it was looking for something. I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up as I realized if the swirl keeps going and getting wider, it will hit me. I was still frozen and had the feeling like they knew I was there. My eyes were the only thing I could move and I watched this spot light on the ground. This light stopped 1 foot in front of my extended foot. I couldn&rsquo;t move. It was a round circle of light about 2 feet across. I felt like this thing was getting information from me, like when a dog sniffs for information. I had no clue what this light would do to me. My brain raced with ideas that it could burn me, that little people were going to get me, that army men were going to drop out of this thing on a rope, that this thing was going to drop out the sky and blow up and kill me because I was so close to it  then the light just pulled back. At this point, I was slightly relieved and could move again. I turned to run up my yard away from this thing and I noticed I could no longer see the blades of grass, it was very dark. I thought this is strange.  I could here my brother up a head of me running too. I watched over my shoulder as this huge object went backwards a tiny bit and then pulled forward. I was afraid it was going to follow me but it turned back east and slowly went back to the exact spot it had came from and went back down below the trees, not over the trees, but down into the trees.  Sometimes, airplanes can look like they are going up when they are coming toward you from a mountainside, I have seen that. This object didn&rsquo;t appear to come from over the horizon, or on leaving, did it appear to go over the horizon. On both cases, it appeared to come up from and go down into the horizon. I found this strange because there would be nothing but woods at that spot with no clearing.  My brother and I bolted into the house and told my parents what we had seen. I felt like I had walked into a staged scene. My father was sitting in the kitchen with the paper covering his face. My mother was standing in the kitchen wiping her hands with a towel. She was wearing an old apron. She never wore aprons. My father usual sat in the living room with the paper. They did not get excited. My mother slowly went and looked out the window. She said she didn&rsquo;t see anything. Here were 2 kids, breathing heavy, and scared, and these people didn&rsquo;t seem upset. They were good parents so to this day, I am perplexed. Maybe my adrenaline was pumped up high and slowing everything down, or maybe it was staged, I don&rsquo;t know. I learned quickly after that that no one really believes these stories. So I just learned to stop talking about it. I had seen one silver saucer high in the sky before while with about 10 other kids. I haven&rsquo;t seen anything like this cigar shaped object. I am now 43 and still can&rsquo;t answer my own questions concerning this incident.  I am Irish/Indian ancestry, novicane challenged, and quite often like to watch sky in big areas. I do believe this object picked up a bad gene I have for low blood pressure and left me alone because of that. Please add my experience to your data base and leave out my name I guess. Since it&rsquo;s an older case I didn&rsquo;t know if you would want it put into the online additions. I do have other questions. Why would this thing have to pull back a little bit to move forward?  That sounds like man made directional flight. What where the small indentations, mottled appearance for? I have never heard these mentioned in a UFO description before?  This incident was one of the first in my life that made me realize, my parents can&rsquo;t protect me from the world. But I&rsquo;ve ruled out some type of subconscience trick my mind played on me because there were 7 people who saw this thing. How my parents didn&rsquo;t see it out of the big kitchen bay window I don&rsquo;t know. And why my mother was wearing an apron is one of the biggest questions. That was strange. Ironically though, the old oak was the same tree I had been knocked out by when I was about 6, in a bad sledding accident. When I came to, I was on the couch and sweating terribly with my coat still on, and my mother watching. So I estimate I had to be unconscience for at least 20 minutes to be that hot. Odd.   This was definitely a physical object.  But after almost 30 years, I have no clue! When I was in kindergarten to about fourth grade, I would have this recurring dream where a space ship lands in the playground at school. The whole school population is there, teachers and kids. These little men come out and want to talk but no one steps forward. For some reason, I was always the only one who could talk to these little men. They were the same size as me and friendly, not scary. So in this recurring dream, I would have to be the one they talked with. I would walk up by the ship and start talking and then I would wake up.  I could never understand why no one else could talk with them. My present alien dreams involve wars being raged above our heads, where humans are hurt because they are in the way of fighting aliens. Very strange. So I remain clueless after 30 years. Months ago I observed six red lights from about a distance of 15 miles from an overlook. These lights just seemed to hover around a nuclear power plant cooling tower. They would move a little and then stop.   Then after about 15 minutes they just all formed a line and went west. I&rsquo;ve never heard of 6 helicopters inspecting a cooling tower at one time have you? I was just glad they didn&rsquo;t come by me.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I know what my friends and I saw.  Back in the summer of 2004 I was attending a Wednesday night Church service in the Richpond area of Bowling Green, Kentucky.  The area is located just off the Nashville Road.  My friends and I were outside in the Church parking lot preparing to leave.  We were all just chatting away as friends do after our Church service.  All of a sudden we began to hear a very loud &quot;roar&quot; approaching our location from up in the sky-extremely low.  We looked around and could not see any lights or aircraft at all.   The &quot;roaring&quot; sound became louder, yet we could still see no object whatsoever.  All of a sudden I looked directly overhead of us and saw a very large black triangular object flying extremely low.  My friends saw the object too.  At first we thought it was probably a B-2 Stealth Bomber, but why would it be flying so low?  The object was flying only around 200 feet above us.  Also, why did the object have no lights flashing as all aircraft normally do-especially flying so low?  We could only see the outline of the triangle, and it was really large.  It was no blimp either.  We all observed the mysterious large object until it just simply disappeared into the night sky.  Looking back, I do not think that this was an aircraft we saw that night.

I cannot remember the exact date...it must have been in April or May of 2000. After it was over my date and I were driving to Rapid City from Pine Ridge (not sure of exact road) to spend the night there. On our drive, some time after 11:00pm, she and I were driving along before you get to Red Shirt when we noticed a strange light in the sky on her side of the car about a mile (not too sure, it was hard to tell). We could tell that it was definitely abnormal because it was some sort of flying object but it was way to low to be a plane or anything else in the middle of nowhere SD. Then all of a sudden, almost instantly the object was about a few hundred feet from us on her side still, probaly 50-70 feet off the ground moving parallel with us. It stayed right along with us for maybe 30 seconds, not long, before it just shot off as fast as it had pulled up. Then, a moment later it re-appeared again, this time on my side of the car about the same distance away and high. It paced with us again for about another 30 seconds and as we approached about a few miles from Red Shirt the object shot off again. We pulled into Red Shirt and drove around the small housing area just to gather our thoughts because while all of this happening, the most typical of things occured. I know it sounds lame to say, but while the object was in our sight, like within a few hundred feet, all of the electric functions in my car began to go crazy. My headlights turned off and on, as did the hazard lights, the stereo, dashboard lights, I mean everything. We even had this junky car phone, which was cool at the time, now it is a piece of junk, but even it started making beeping and ringing all kinds of sounds. It wasn&apos;t until I realized that I couldn&apos;t control what was going on that I instantly thought what to do if the car shuts down. That was the first moment I remember when a bit of panic set in. At first, I was completely in awe. I remember being almost completely fascinated with what we were looking at but it wasn&apos;t until the electronics started going awry that I realized that my date had completely tried almost to hunch down into her foot area of the passenger seat. Then I kind of snapped out of the &quot;awe&quot; and started to feel panic. I remember trying to speed up but that didn&apos;t do anything but mainly I remember just thinking to myself to not let the car stop. It was truly the strangest thing i&apos;ve ever experienced. To be completely honest, even though it was only about 6 years ago, I really don&apos;t remember that many details as I think about it. I remember the lights were different colors, but none were distinct, like they weren&apos;t like christmas lights where there is blue, a green, a red. These were more like yellows and reds I think and I remember they were all in what seemed like the outside ring of the object, not on top or below. And I don&apos;t really remember what shape the object was, it was really dark on the road. I just remember being really awestruck, almost excited, and then overtaken by a bit of panic and it was over. I remember we tried telling people right after that but nobody thought much of it. I told a few close friends but I, just like them, really wouldn&apos;t think much of it unless I saw it for myself. This honestly happened, and I have no problem talking about it to anyone but, either people don&apos;t care or probaly don&apos;t believe me. I tried to bring it up only one time with the girl who was with me that night since then but I could tell that she really didn&apos;t want to talk about it so I guess we&apos;ll just leave it at that. I told my grandfather a few years ago who lived in outside of Pine Ridge for many years and he said that he would sit outside at nights and watch all sorts of flying objects fly similar routes. He never say anything like what I saw or anything as close but he thought it was just some sort of test or practice flying that pilots from Ellsworth were doing at night and what I saw was probaly just something that Ellsworth was testing, not aliens or that type of UFO&apos;s.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There was no noise associated with it, just a bright rectangular light.", "Strange black Object videotaped near plane in Windsor, England.I have recently been looking at some of my video footage from a recent trip down the South of the Country (England) and made a shooking discovery on one piece of my footage. I noticed a strange black object that appeared quite close to a plane I have not idea what i have captured but I am sure it is not simply another plane or helicopter. At the time of the sighting i was on top of the Windsoir Wheel which is a ride similiar to the London Eye at the time i was at the very top of the wheel. It was just by chance i captured this UFO because at the time i was looking to videotape planes not UFO&apos;s.

I was a freshman at Arizona State University and my buddy and I decided to go hiking one weekend up in Sedona.  I&apos;m not positive as to the date, but I&apos;m pretty sure it was in the Spring and though I don&apos;t know the exact time, I&apos;m positive it happened in the afternoon.  When I say it &apos;happened&apos; I&apos;ll have to clarify.  We were hiking around one of the trails on the edge of town and neither of us remembered seeing or hearing anything at all.  However at one point on the trail, we had a passer-by take two pictures of us, one right after the other perhaps 10 seconds apart (just to make sure they turned out).  When I developed the film, the first of the photos had a very distinct image in the upper left hand corner whereas the the second had no such image at all.  The image was of a long, slim, black object in the sky, tapering to a point at one end and a hook at the other.  The image appeared in no other photo in that roll of film.  It&apos;s obvious from looking at it, that it wasn&apos;t just something on the lens - after all, it&apos;s in one photo but not the other and the woman never wiped the lens.  And I know it&apos;s not the photo paper used because it showed up on the negatives.  I&apos;ve also tried scanning the photo into my computer and zooming in to get a better look.  The edges are well defined; it&apos;s not as though it&apos;s a distortion, lens flare or blur.  It was jet black and it was out in broad daylight - I have no idea what to think.  I&apos;m sorry, but I don&apos;t really know what else to say about it.  I can&apos;t remember the name of the trail, but I know it was near a pizza place right off Highway 89A.  I think the name of the pizza place is Moondog&apos;s Pizza?   It&apos;s just a tiny mom and pop joint.  The only other thing I can say is that I still have the photos, and most probably the negatives.  I&apos;ve never seen anything of this nature in a photo, which is the only reason it caught my attention.  I&apos;ll try uploading them later today to the email address.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

However, my eyes were drawn back to it as I saw it move from north to south and fade out.  I have seen many meteors (was awake for the Leonid showers) and this was moving too slow for a meteor...although, at that altitude (not sure but it seemed way up there) it must have been moving along.  Thought maybe it was a satellite that just happened to catch the sun reflecting off of it but I then saw two airplanes move in that direction.

Let me back up and say that she was only about 7 years old at the time and I had recently given her a silver baton as one of her birthday presents which falls on Valentines day.  Well, I was on my way, taking her to school early one morning not far from where we live and i had noticed she was being exceptionally quiet and staring intently out of the front windshield of my blazer.  I said , honey, what are you looking at, and she said, &quot;mommy, theres a baton in the sky&quot;.  I said &quot;what&quot; and looked in the direction that had her attention-and I saw this -perfect cigar shaped metallic looking object just above tree top level.  I immediatedly pulled my truck over and got out.  I was mesmerized. I probably just stood there a couple of minutes just watching this object-and if i had to estimate, it was probably the size of a large automobile more pewter in color than silver.  I never saw it move. I heard absolutely no sound, no lights, not anything, other than the fact that it was hovering just above the trees, and was extrememly close to us.  After watching it in awe, I suddenly got scared and jumped back in my vehicle and left-when I looked back I could no klonger see the object.

Last night (Friday 21st July 2006 at approx 2.20 am) I witnessed what I believe was a UFO. So far as I know, I was the sole witness. The weather conditions at the time of sighting were like any crisp winter night. The moon was waning (although it was perhaps oddly well lit outside) there was minimal cloud clover and the air was still, no wind or rain. I was brushing my hair before going to sleep, when I heard something like the noise of an approaching aircraft. Only, it didn&apos;t sound like a jet engine - it was of a indescribable, strange pitch and more thunderous... strange enough to give me the heebie jeebies. Given that there&apos;s a flight curfew in Adelaide between 11 PM - 5 AM, and the sound it made was so odd, I went to look out the window in time to see it almost right overhead. It wasn&apos;t very high up, and I could see it was shaped like a backwards triangle with rounded corners. There were two steady clear, blue-white lights with a pulsating red tail light on the underbelly of the craft, but there was enough light outside for me to make out the shape of whatever it was. There was no nose - it was literally a triangle. It was bizarre enough for me to get a chill down my spine and I was contemplating reaching for my phone to take a photo, when it just disappeared! I could hear it but I couldn&apos;t see it, even though my line of sight in the direction it was going was unblocked. I should&apos;ve been able to see it with no problem. I can only assume it went above a cloud - but like I said, it wasn&apos;t at a high altitude, and it wasn&apos;t cloudy last night. I am not located near any airports or air force bases. Besides, it was well past the aforementioned curfew. In addition, I noticed afterwards that the air seemed to be charged with static.", "Black Circular object flying high over tampa FloridaIt was about 5:15pm and my Girlfriend &amp; I were on her back patio.

We both watched it for about 5 minutes as it got closer until it finnally was over her roof and we lost sight of it. She lives in a very populated part of Tampa Florida and there is alot of airplane traffic around her place. However, as we both watched I said there is no way that is a plane or a helicopter it was Just a Black Circular object. about 10 minutes later we went outside and saw a real plane.

The object appeard to be blue - small - and very high.  What attracted my attention was the fact that the object was not showing signs of a commercial craft as it was not on the normal course that commercial flights take into Philladelphia, the blue light was not pulsating but was instead constant.  Also, at one point in it&apos;s progress, the object stopped and remained unmoving for a period of perhaps 8 - 10 seconds before continuing.  Soon after, it could no longer be seen, I assume due to the presence of pollution in the air or indirect light sources on the ground. I would just like to know what this object was / is.

Preceeding this, there were reports of cattle mutilation near Gallup.  I personally interviewed at least 20 witnesses.  While minor details of the craft would vary - and a few of the descriptions were of a small red sphere - the basic description/behavior of the main sightings were virtually identical.  I also spent an evening interviewing a family of 5 who spent the previous evening watching the &quot;silver discs&quot; hovering over the field behind their house in Clovis. One of the more interesting episodes was when aircraft were launched near shift change.  I worked swing shift and on Friday nights if aircraft land with avionics problems, swing shift worked over rather than calling in midnight shift from their weekend.  As usual, we had verified sorties by Job Control and there were no scheduled training flights.  When I heard the sound of F-111 afterburners, I ran to the loading dock to see if they were ours (not Nellis or Mountain Home F-111&apos;s) and saw the &quot;CC&quot; designation on the tail as two Cannon AFB F-111D models launched abreast.  This was the first time I had seen 111&apos;s launch in that formation - it was definitely unusual. Our shop dispatcher immediately called Job Control, upset that our weekend would likely be postponed as we waited for the aircraft to land and likely land with repairs needed.   ((name and rank deleted)) hung up the phone and told us that the launch was no training sortie - it was a &quot;hot scramble&quot;.  This means the aircraft were launched with live ordinance!!  When we inquired as to why, he said they were tracking bogeys. Again, I ran out to the loading dock platform and began scanning the skies.  I saw nothing.  I went back into the A-shop waiting area and ((name deleted)) recalled that a buddy of his was the radar operator on duty.  We called the &quot;radar shack&quot; and got him on the phone.  He said he had never seen anything like this.  The bogeys would appear and disappear, seemingly without cause and would occasionally move at incredible speeds over and near the base.  We asked him if it could be a radar malfunction.  He said &quot;negative&quot; - the radar was in perfect working order and he had run diagnostics.  He also was a seasoned operator and I do not believe it was an error on his part (after all, we DID scramble two $26,000,000 aircraft after something).  I jotted down the phone number to the radar shack - on the off chance.... The two aircraft landed about 90 minutes later and surprisingly, had no repairs that would require us to work over.  I left the shop and went to the Airman&apos;s club on base, had a few beers and played some fooseball.  I left for the barracks and arrived in the CQ (charge of quarters) area at around 02:00.  I noted the phone on the desk and decided, what the heck.  I dialed the number to the radar shack and here is my account of what transpired, with my comments:  (ring-ring) VOICE (excited and loud): &quot;This is Capt.((name deleted)) - IDENTIFY YOURSELF!&quot; [OK, in the USAF you do not answer a phone that way.  Even Generals do not answer phones that way - it could be the President.  Everyone is taught protocol - &quot;This is &lt;rank&gt; &lt;name&gt;, ma&apos;am or sir.  How may I help you?&quot;  Also, the odds of a Captain being in the middle of a cow pasture in a small radar building at 02:00 on a Friday night is really slim.]  ME: &quot;This is ((name and rank deleted)).&quot;  [I almost hung up.  I knew upon hearing his voice I was in trouble.]  VOICE: &quot;State your business, ((name and rank deleted))!&quot;  ME: &quot;I was wondering if there were any more bogeys sighted?&quot;  VOICE: &quot;Who told you there were bogeys sighted?!?&quot;  ME: &quot;I spoke to the radar operator earlier - we scrambled two aircraft...&quot;  VOICE: &quot;I don&apos;t know what you are talking about - there were no bogeys and no scramble.&quot;  ME: &quot;I saw them take off...&quot;  VOICE: [Begins to yell and curse - like a sailor!  I mean REALLY bad - very hostile towards me].  Who is your C.O.?  [In the USAF, we don&apos;t have a &quot;C.O.&quot; or Commanding Officers - we have Squadron Commanders but since my father was ((deleted--military))  for ((XX))  yrs., I knew what he meant.  This was my first clue that this guy was fishy.]  ME: ((name deleted)) sir.&quot;  VOICE: &quot;And what is your serial number?&quot; [Strike two - no such thing as serial number in the USAF at that time.  It was replaced years earlier by the SSAN - social security account number.  NOBODY called it serial number because that was a throwback to the &quot;brown shoe days&quot; of the Army Air Corps - which was very past tense and a history the modern Air Force would just as soon forget.  But again, I knew what he wanted so I complied without questioning the use of terms.  At that point, I knew this guy was not USAF.]  ME: &quot;((number deleted))&quot;  VOICE: &quot;What you are talking about never happened.  You are a lying &lt;curse-curse-curse&gt; and I can prove it.  I&apos;ll have you  busted - yell-curse-yell-curse.  I will be watching your every move, Airman.  You are not to mention a word of this to anyone, ever.  AM I CLEAR??&quot;  ME: &quot;Yes sir.&quot;  VOICE: &quot;We know where you work, we know where you are - if you communicate any of this bullshit story you have concocted, I will make sure you end up in a place worse than Leavenworth.&quot;  [Leavenworth is as bad as it can (legally) get for an errant military person.  I fully took this as a physical threat.  It was not spoken plainly but it was as clear to me as it was to him.]  During the days after this conversation we received an order from the Base Commander, citing USAFReg 111-(?) which I looked up in the base library.  Basically, it says that no information regarding any unidentified flying object can be communicated to anyone under threat of court martial.  I also kept running the conversation with ((name and rank deleted)) over in my mind.  Something was wrong with it all.  I also became upset with his conduct.  As an officer, he stepped over the line - big time.  I began considering bringing him up on charges of conduct unbecoming. With anger and indignance as emotional bulwarks, I began to search for this ((name and rank deleted)).  Despite an exhaustive search on and off base, there was no such person.  I thought maybe the guy at the radar shack knew him.  When I called for him, I was told by his Sgt. that he had been transferred out.  I told him it was important I get in touch with him and was told he had been sent TDY to destinations unknown.  I detected this Sgt. was &quot;touchy&quot; about this situation.  His voice and behavior were showing signs of stress.  When I said that I didn&apos;t reacall him mentioned having orders, the Sgt abruptly ended the conversation. So, who was this ((name and rank deleted))?  I don&apos;t know but I suspect he works for a non-military, extra-governmental agency that is directly involved in the supression of the evidence surrounding UFO phenomenon.  I never heard from him nor do I suspect anyone was actually watching me. Several days passed by and the UFO sightings seemed to diminish in frequency.  One night, after midnight, I was driving back to base from Clovis on Hwy 60.  I noticed some flashing lights over the base that seemed to be hovering.  I figured they are Jolly Greens (Sikorsky HH-3E helicopters) that land there to refuel from time to time.  (BTW, I am an aviation expert and private pilot in addition to fmr. USAF)  As I approach the exit to the base, I notice the lights - 2 sets - are still hovering over the base.  This struck me as curious because they would never hold that long over the base at this time of night. I begin to wonder if this could be UFOs.  I begin to watch intently, glancing at the road occasionally.  As I move closer, I can make out 2 outlines of disk shapes, with a perimiter of multi-colored lights that appear to be on the very edge of the disks.  They are either moving around the ship or strobing in such a way to give that impression.  The objects also are moving - hovering - moving.  I notice that there seems to be no acceleration curve in their movement.  It is instantaneous, linear ON-OFF.  I make a correllation - the speed the lights appear to be moving &apos;round the ship increases, then the ship moves - then the lights slow down again.  I see bright blue lights out of the corner of my left eye.  The power lines along the hwy. are exploding (or maybe a transformer) and huge blue balls of arc light are thrown onto the hwy in front of my car.  I reflexively dodge them.  Looking back in the rear view, I notice a small fire is beginning. I look back at the skies over the base.  Only one ship is left.  Regret letting the other &quot;get away&quot; and watch the last ship without averting my gaze for anything.  Yes, I call them &quot;ships&quot; because now, I believe that is what they are.)  The lights on this one begin to rotate faster and faster until the multi-colors &quot;meld&quot; into a ring then ball of bright white (this happens in like one second or less - multi-color ring &gt; meld to white ring &gt; burst into incredible PURE WHITE ball of light- like no light I&apos;ve seen) and it streaks past horizon in a split second.  On the flat desert, clear night, 500&apos; altitude (est.) - you figure the speed. I pull over and open the driver&apos;s door of my Buick.  Dazed - absolutely stunned - my world has just been turned on its head.  Everything I know is wrong.  There is also something like a &quot;force&quot; that compels me to commit every detail of this evening to memory because one day it will be important.  I don&apos;t know why but it will be important one day.  The next Monday, the Clovis newspaper had a small report of an &quot;unexplained blackout&quot; on the east side of town that night.

The object was to our East, between Fletcher Hills and the City of El Cajon in California about 15 miles East of San Diego. The lights appeared to be moving away from us slowly in an Eastward direction. The three lights formed a triangular shape, and the top light would pulsate on and off, as well as the red on all three lights would change in color and intensity. The red color was about as red and bright as a laser pointing device. There was numerous small aircraft in the area from Gillespie Field  (Three letter airport code: SEE)in El cajon and as well, many commercial airliners passing overhead (altitude would be about 3000 to 6000 feet for the commericial aircraft on this approach - yes I am a rated private pilot) in the approach pattern to Lindbergh Field in San Diego. However, the light pattern was not conistent with an airplane, nor was the movement consistent with either a helicopter or airplane. The object appeared to be steady (non-moving) for about 5 minutes, then it started drifting slowly to the ESE. The object then vanished. Our view was not blocked or obstructed, so it did not go behind a building, tree, cloud, etc., it just appeared to go dark all of a sudden. A small plane in the touch and go landing pattern at Gillespie Field (they use runway 27R during night ops) flew through the area within two minutes of us losing visual contact of the object. We tried to take digital photographs, but my son has yet to download them to the computer so we can see if we captured anything or not. This was also not mistaking the local fireworks displays going on around town, as we could not see any fireworks from our location and the object bore no resemblence to any fireworks. The weather was clear, with no clouds or low lying fog in the area - visibility was about 20 miles, temperature was approximately 80 Deg F, with light winds. We could see plenty of stars in and around where we saw the object both before, during and after the event. There was no sound heard from the object, nor was there any sudden movements. The appearence and disappearence were the only quick actions by the object, and the movement was similiar to a hot air ballon, in that it seemed to drift more than fly. We have seen many hot air ballons, and there was no flame present such as what a hot air ballon would have, only three red lights and a visible dark area between the lights, which we believed to be the structure of the object. I tried to logically explain what it was to myself since observing the object last night, but I can not come up with anything which I can say, yes that is what it was. I have had to file this in my mind as &quot;unknown&quot; or when my son asked me what it was, I said &quot;I have no idea kiddo&quot; and that is where it remains.", "I was looking outside and saw a craft going east. I ran to get a camera, but i was late. Then another appeared but it was to late when my camera was out because the tree and my neighbor&apos;s house blocked my view. I left my camera on anyways and caught another object that hovered over my neighbor&apos;s house then it disappeared behind it. This one was dark and shadowy in appearance, nunlike the other two I saw that were gray, shiney, and disk shaped. After this I was wanted to see more, but all I could find were helicopters and air plaines. The one I caught on tape can be found on youtube. It was originally 2 seconds long, but I put it in extremely slow motion.http://www.youtube.com/my_videos_edit?video_id=QosspheM9kQ", "Saw lights on hovering craft at 0235 stopped car and listened/looked and there was no sound.I am a Registered ((deleted--medical)) Technologists (RVT) and take call at ((name deleted)) Hospital in Xenia on a rotation basis.  I was called in at 2:00 am to perform a ((deleted)) study on a patient with suspected ((deleted)). I live in Madeira, Ohio which is an hour away from the hospital.  The route I take is north on I-71 to the Route 73 exit, east about a quarter mile and then north on Route 380, which gors straight into Xenia. At 0220 I was on 380 when I noticed two bright headlight appearing lights in the sky to the northeast of me.  I assumed it was a plane and continued driving.  A couple of minutes later I noticed the the lights appeared to be in the same place, not moving.  Again I assumed it was an optical trick and that the plane wass coming straight at me and that was why it looked like it was not moving. After another couple of minutes I began to realize that this object was not movingg in the manner of a plane, if at all.  I slowed my car down to a stop and in deed the object was hovering about a half to a mile away.  Now I drove on toward it and and it remiained fairly stationary.  As I neared it appeared to be just above the treetops and the lights were very bright.  I stopped my car and looked at it sticking my head out of the window.  There was no engine noise and I could not make out a distinct shape because of the light and a foggy mist which enhanced the bright light effect, but my impression was it was long shaped  (?cigar vs cylinder). I was afraid to leave the car and was aware that I had a patient waiting for me in the ER. The craft then began to move to the southwest (behind me) at a slow rate of speed.  I could see anothers car light in my rearview mirror and I proceeded to Xenia. On my return trip I went the same way and saw nothing. That&apos;s it in a nutshell", "was driving &amp; square craft hovered over me! I sped up to 80ph..but my speed kept slowing down. I slowed for a SHARP turn, craft was still over me. I took off again, pedal to the medal....but, the harder I tried, they slowed me down (I am freaking out!) they finally had me to complete halt. I pushed the petal to go.no way... so, myself &amp; my dog jumped out and ran into the bush to hide.  Next, we saw many,many lights thru the bush near us aprox 1000 yards away then we saw 50 or better [whatevers] moving about. Then I saw what looked like a huge magget/cacoon aprox size [from my distance] 12&apos;long 12&apos; high.  they had lights on this object. It reminded me of an ant colony around the queen.  But, some notice me, or heard myself or my dog from noise of leaves.3 Centries came into bush ....[they looked human] but, they had REALLY long legs and REALLY long arms...very large torso...normal size head. did not see eyes, light was behind them.we ran and covered ourselves with we could find.they did&apos;nt give up soon they keptlooking, but we layed still,they missed us, they aprox 50&apos; there was 2 more of maggot looking things, all 3 were in arow like a train station with all the worker ants [example] so much more to say you can contact me", "Daytime Siteing of three white discs over Delray Beach, FloridaI had just left work in the Los Verdes condos where my work is and I was sitting at the traffic light at Military Trail and I just glanced to the northwest of my location towards Atlantic Blvd and there they were three white discs moving very slow towards the west and were maybe a mile up in the sky away from my position. it was about 4:43PM on Aug 5, 2006  The first one was ahead of the other 2 that were near each other and they were silent and moved in like a floating pattern (Not a straght line) Like up and down and a kinda wobble like free floating. I could see them clear as day and I pointed up to the sky and the people in the car behind me also got out and looked at them. The sighting lasted about 2 mins and as soon as they got my 9:00 position they blended into the sky (just disappeared). I have seen alot of strange objects in the night sky but this is my first Daytime sighting and these were absolutly real!  I stopped to talk to some people down the street and they said they have been seeing Strange Objects at night over this area.", "On Wednesday, June 21st, 2006 at 6:50 PM, I witnessed one contrail moving at great speed, then I observed another smaller contrail faster than the first and gaining speed on the first contrail, then a third contrail following both of the objects. All three contrails disappeared at the same time.  The back round was a blue sky no clouds in the early evening, I have video and pictures.  I called the FAA but it was too late they were closed.", "boomerang shape rotating, looked like parasailers, but objects were rising higher and disappearedmy boyfriend were at schnucks on zumbehl road getting groceries and my boyfriend stopped as i was headed inside and said look in the sky. at first i thought in was hanggliders or parasailers and then realized there wasn&apos;t anybody hanging from them. and if that was what they were were they would have descended towards us/ or the ground.  but it kept raising but very slowly.  the shape was boomerang like and rotating in an assortment of directions, so it seemed to be changing shape.  then they disappeared into the blue sky.  there was no lights and no sound, and 3 aircrafts flew underneath them but these objects were so high i would assume that they were rather large. we thought maybe someone could give us some insight on the event that ocurred.", "Blue Red Yellow and Green LightsMy godsisters and I went to go check on the water in our pool that we&apos;d just got. It wasn&apos;t completely filled so we decided to lay out on the trampoline and wait. I said lets look at the stars while we wait. It was night so we had a flasflight. I said oooooooo look at the star its shining so bright...As we kept looking that star that was shining  bright started to hover and as it hovered in the sky we noticed green red and blue lights...abd this circular figure had 1 big ballish thing in the middle shining brightly...thats what made us think it was a star. I said to my godsisters do you see what i see and they said yes.so we shined our flashlight in the sky and as we did it moved closer to us...so we turned it off and another figure just like it took off before our eyes with the snap of a finger...we&apos;ve never seen anything move that fast. As we looked around at other parts of the sky we noticed about 5 more. They all were hovering and a gigantic circle with their lights bliking...Red, Blue Green Yellow! In that order. And we said that they couldn&apos;t be planes because planes cant hover. And hovering is when something can move but be in one spot. Kind of like floating. This shall go down in history!", "slow, noiseless craft, with 6 lightsthe object had 6 lights, one at the nose, one on the tip of each &quot;wing&quot;, and 3 blinking near each of the others.the body of the object was not visible for lack of direct light.it was flying at approximately 1000 ft.but made no sound what so ever, while moving about 20 mph", "2 space ships in the skyLast night I was out walking my dog, and I happened to look up at the sky because I read something about Jupiter being able to be seen. As I was admiring it and the moon a blinking light caught my eye and as I was staring at it I was wondering if maybe it was a plane. After I put my dog in the house I ran back outside to look again and thats when I notice there was 3 of them. At first they were all flying in a triangle then one of them disapeared. So here I am watching the remaing 2 ships, as far as I could tell they had red and white blinking lights which went around in a cirle. The lights were blinking quite fast as they went across the sky. I looked like they were deliberately flying at the same speed with one of them flying slightly behind the other but higher up, the other was flying ahead of the other but lower. But the were definitly flying together. I don&apos;t know if they were trying to find a place to land or not because they soon disappeared behind some trees. I was outside watching them for about 45 mins. I thought the light were blinking way to fast ato be airplane and I have never seen 2 planes flying together like they were.", "Several unusual lights in the sky between kingston and perth.On the drive between Perth and Kingston we witnessed several lights in the sky behaving strangly, At first we thought it was a group of air craft except they hovered in the same possition for quite some time.  And when one of them would move it was at what must have been an incredible speed for it covered quite a bit of distance very quickly.  Each light appeared to be able to move in any direction both forward back and up and down which caused us to realise that we may be seeing something unusual.  I can&apos;t say the date exactly only that it was towards the end of febuary between the 25th and the 30th.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

At about 11:30am, I noticed what appeared at first glance to be a star in the sky.   Then I noticed that it was moving very slowly and stopping and sliding slightly left, then right and stopping in a very solid stopped position - hovering.  I was able to get my video recorder and capture close to 8 second of video of this before it slipped behind trees and out of view.  This object appeared to be very high in the sky, maybe 20,000-30,000 feet.  When I went back and reviewed my tape, I had a chance to have a better look.  This thing was white in color, not silver.  It almost had a shape of a hot air balloon, but it was definitely not, just this general shape, kinda like an ear syringe but thicker on the downward spout of it.  It was very round on top, then an appendage of some type down from the bottom of it.  Very odd.  The downward appendage seemed to angle off at the very tip.  No sound at all.  Not very fast, yet very deliberate moves and changed direction.  I want to mention that one hour later, there was one huge &quot;X&quot; shaped comtrail in the area of this UFO. Maybe airforce had been there to investigate?  Or Maybe since I was paying attention to the skies I just noticed what&apos;s always there. If anyone else caught this or knows what it might be, it would be cool to compare notes.  My hunch is that it is some type of suveillance drone.  It did have a similar shape to those UFOs recently seen by airforce in Mexico though via infrared.", "southwest New Hampshire, pulsing multi-colored light, stationary then moving to high speedI was sitting in my easy chair watching Tv.  Through the window to my left I noticed a bright red flashing light, stationary in the western sky.  I expected it to move, but it didn&apos;t.  As I watched it for a minute or so the red light changed from a single red light to a somewhat circular array of less intense lights that did not flash.  I could now see red, white and blue-green colored lights.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me so I got up and went outside with binoculars.  As I watched it would alternate between the two light paterns.  After about a minute it started to move toward the east.  It moved slowly at first and rapidly gained speed as it passed overhead and went out of sight to the east.  It was a very quiet night with no wind and we did not hear a sound.  It accelerated to a speed faster than a jet plane.  A moment after we lost sight of it,(my wife was standing beside me watching this also, we saw what looked like a very bright meteor drop almost straight down, about 5 degrees to the left of where we had last seen the odd lights which had passed out of our view behind trees.  The meteor was bright yellow and lasted only a second.  It may have had nothing to do with the lights we were watching.  Most of the sky was very clear and full of stars.  There were some clouds low in the sky to the west.  We could not see the actual shape of the object, only the lights.  We saw the lights against a clear sky, not through clouds.  Whatever it was it appeared to be quite high in the sky.  I would guess between 25000 &amp; 45000 feet.  My wife and I are both retired.  We live on a mountain top at the end of a dead end road, about a mile from any neighbors.", "Several Aircraft looking lights stood still in sky for 45 seconds, then faded away.Approx. 3 miles away.

I went outside to join them and my Dad told me he had just seen a strange object pass accross the sky. I asked him about it and he said he was looking up and saw an object that was pitch black about the size of an adult thumb at arms length move across the sky very fast and blocking out the background grey and all stars as it went. It moved without a sound. I didn&apos;t see anything but then about 5 minutes later at high altitude a triangle of red lights moved across slownly and silently. It had one flashing light and not the usual red/white combination and obvious plane shape you see every day. I&apos;m not sure if this second object was a military plane or something connected to the first sighting but it was weird. Back to the first sighting - my dad described it as &quot;In star trek speak... it was something under a cloaking device - it was a very dark pitch black against the background glow of the sky&quot;. I&apos;ve listed the object as triangle in the report because that is the shape of the other object we saw - my Dad was unable to give me a shape of the first object as it moved quickly.", "It was a Bright Red Light as big as a Tennis Ball in the sky.When i was looking at the constilation of the Big Bear, i suddenly saw a big bright red light the size of a tennis ball coming out of the dark sky from the south-west it continued to the north-west in a parabollic shaped path then it disappeared behind the buildings. Suddennly, the same shape came back! It was as if it was returning back but not on the same path but a slightly differenet one from the north to south-west. Then suddenly it came back again! The same bright red light from the south-west to the north then it vanished behind the buildings. The light was substantially fast as if you put your hand in the sky and then quickly move it across. Moreover, the light wasn&apos;t sharp. It was blurred, very blurred as if it was shining from behind a fog. I can also say that i even saw something like it when I looked up after all of this was over but it was smaller and moved in a zigzaged formation an then it suddenly dissapeared.", "As i was driving  to my house the craft was hovering above the road.

Just east of Plainfield is Indianapolis and just west is plenty of nothing,just a bunch of feilds basically and highway 40. I have always been interested in ufos and ets since i was probably about 6 years old.Because around the age of 6 me and my family, me,mom,dad,and my two older sisters moved into a really big really old looking house in Russelville the county just west of this.There were these really old and dusty and stinky books on ufos and aliens in the house when we moved in, and that is where my interest in it all began. But anyway, so i was living with my sister and i liked it, it was fun.I cant remember the exact night it was but it was around the middle of August of 2005, and im pretty sure it was a Friday night.I was doing what i always did there on a Friday night, just staying up late watching tv.One of my favorite movies came on at 2:30 and it was do to go off at 4:10.So i watched the movie all the way through and at the end of the movie during all the credits, i got up and stretched and yawned and all that good stuff,and peaked out my window for no reason really. The exact second i peaked out the blinds, i could see 3 entities walking across the street under a streetlight staring at me, like they knew i was going to look out the window at that exact second.They did not stop and stare at me, they kept on walking and looked at me while they were walking.There were 2 taller ones and 1 shorter one.They walked very strangly, kinda like zombies, with their backs bent way down low, and their arms just dangeling(long limbs) and their heads were just dangeling aswell but cocked a little to look at me.The heads were slightly larger than human but not much.And they were not walking side by side they were walking back to back with the short one in the middle. Because of the lighting or whatever i could not tell what color they were, they just looked black even right under the streetlight,and i couldnt see the eyes either, basically i could just see the outline of them, but that i could make out quite clearly.So im up in my room looking at them and they are looking at me and im looking at them and they are lookin at me untill i couldnt see them any more because i lost sight of them behind the houses i guess.So the next thing i did was take my hand off the blinds, take a step back, put my hands on my head and said&quot;what do i do now&quot;, and as soon as i said that i slowly fell to the floor, i could not use my legs at all, and my heart was beating very fast. And while i was on the floor in panic i could smell something that i can only describe as &apos;insanity&apos; , but not like an odor in the room but rather way up in my nose. I crawled to my recliner cause i did not have a bed, thats what i slept in every night, and i lied there in panic, still unable to use my legs and my heart racing, i have never had a harder time trying to keep my eyes open, but i was afraid to fall asleep. While im laying there i reached for my cell phone, i thought about calling my other sister who lives in the same neiborhood, i even thought about calling 911 or screaming so my sister in bed could hear me. Fortunatly i was able to maintain my composure and just sit there and suffer through it and wait it out. Eventually after about 20 minutes my heart slowed back down to normal speed, and i could slowly but surely walk again, and open my freagin eye lids. I was just glad to be OK. I soon fell asleep.I woke up the next morning fine for the most part.Ive been thinking about that night ever since.The anxiety of the experience is long gone by now, however i still think about it.To be honest i think about it and &quot;them&quot; all the time. I dont know why the hell that happend but it did. Sometimes i think that i was not supposed to see them, but i did, and maybe they demobilized my legs so i could not run outside and and get a closer look or something, i really dont know, all i know is what i saw. Ive told my experiece to one very well known website, ive never heard back from them, i think they think im jokeing but im not. thank you.", "2 low flying lights traveling east near Caton Farm Road and Red Hawk Drive, visible for 10 seconds.Seem to look like 2 glowing birds, traveling east 200 yards south of Caton Farm Road, west of Drauden.

I was admiring ophiuchus and othere southern oriented constalations when I noticed &quot;sw about halfway from zenith&quot; a extreamly bright star? pulsing red and blue. I have seen stars look this way when aurora or sunspots are active&quot; but not this bright!&quot; So as my sled warmed up I ran in and grabed my trusty spining sky chart and could not find where this mag -3.8+  - -6mag star was?  it would have been just lower right of Spica  and above crater.I thought hmmm maby its a variable star not knowing it was too bright to be that at the time.Then I thought I saw it do a quick loop back to its origanal spot,first I though maby I shouldnt be snowmobiling I must be tired &quot;seeing things&quot; But then I saw it do a quick j type turn and bounce back to it&apos;s spot before NOW I KNEW I SAW THAT I THOUGHT! I ran in grabed roommate and tried to get him to focus on object lining it up w/ a pole as refference to see if it moved. It did and he reluctanly said&quot; I think I see what your seeing&quot; It moves quick and then stops and pulses right? Yep.I jumped on my sled and moved to a darker location w/ less lightpolution.I set up a stick as reffernce point and layed on sled seat to stay still/steady and watched as this object did loops and figure 8,jturns always very fast and ending in same spot then it would get brighter red and blue pulses. I did have a cheap pair of spotting binoc. with,   all I could see was it was like a squashed circle very bright seeming to have 2 or 3 points of light at edges blending together red and blue some white.My first guess after seeing it at 8x was &quot;damn smart it acts like a star moves fast,must be military test platform way up above NM.But the more I watched it I kept thinking how do they deal with that g-force,this was amazing! I wish my camera was w/ me I didnt even think of grabing it! if I would have locked shutter open it would have shown up perfect.I also cursed myself for not buying a video camera and even more importantly a good telescope as I would have loved to see this thing at 100x power or better. I  now spend many nights looking up and out. I saw a simalar object 3 years later same area @ zenith did 2 zigzags then backed up took off NW &quot;Gone&quot; same size bright blue light some red pulsing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

A co-worker of mine was explaining how rainbows form inside the ice crystals of stratus clouds.  I looked up at the sky and my attention was immediately grabbed by an small object flying through the sky.  It was very small, but I could DEFINATELY identify it&apos;s color and shape.  It was oval shaped...almost like the shape that a ball assumes if you put pressure on it.  It was not as flat as the stereotypical &apos;flying saucer&apos; shape...more round.  I immediately thought to myself...&quot;that looks like a freakin&apos; UFO&quot;!!  I stared and stared as it flew rather quickly across the sky...in front of the clounds.  It&apos;s color was a very dark, steel blue.  I tracked it across the sky with my finger.  My other coworkers were returning from their lunch breaks also.  I was pointing and screaming...&quot;Look! What is that? What is that?&quot;  My coworkers were yelling back at me, &quot;Where? Where?&quot;  I I was freaking out, jumping up and down, yelling &quot;Right there! Right there!&quot;  But no one saw the stupid thing.  I was in shock as it disappeared from sight behind the roof of our office.    I am still in shock that no one saw it.  I&apos;ve been running around the office trying to talk with the people who were out there...and they look at me like I am nuts.  I am submitting this report because I want to know if someone else saw something, or if there was a weather balloon, or jet fighter flying over Lancaster County, Pennsylvania at 1 pm on August 8, 2006.  I know people think I&apos;m imagining things.  I really want some type of affirmation.  I know what an airplane looks like.  I know what jet fighters look like.  THEY ARE NOT ROUND!!  Was it a weather balloon?  Can they travel that fast?  This thing was not floating.  It didn&apos;t hover.  It didn&apos;t start and stop.  It didn&apos;t fly sideways.  It flew in a straight line.  It was fast.  IT WAS OVAL shaped!  It was DARK BLUE!  I am a college educated professional woman.  I don&apos;t believe in extraterrestial abductions and all of that sci-fi stuff.  I would really like to explain this.  I know people think I was hallucinating.  Perhaps I was.  I hope that someone out there saw it also.  I hope that it has an explanation.

I (the Mother) thought it might be lightning so I went out to the pool to extinquish the tiki torches surrounding the pool when I looked up &amp; noticed 4 very bright &quot;stars&quot; in the distance. Because I swim at night alot, I know that I&apos;ve never seen these stars before. They were in a straight line &amp; were changing colors. (red, blue or green &amp; white)I went inside &amp; brought out my binoculars for a better look. They were stationary for about 10 minutes &amp; then I watched one of them move (very quickly) higher that the other three &amp; stop again. Then I noticed 2 more to the West of the other 4. I observed them for several minutes. Occasionally one of them would rapidly change positions so that the line was no longer straight. After about 30 minutes of watching this I went back inside the house because the fire ants were biting my feet &amp; ankles &amp; my kids were very frightned. The objects were quite a distance from my home so I couldn&apos;t make out a shape. I live approximately 10 miles from the gulf coast in the country away from any bright lights &amp; the objects were to the South appearing to me to be over the gulf. I wish I could have gotten a closer look but my binoculars are not very good &amp; my children were upset. I did not see the flashes of light that the kids had seen before I went outside. I separetly asked both of them to describe the flashes to me &amp; they both described the same thing. They said it was just a bluish white flash of light like a camera&apos;s flash bulb going off only much, much bigger.

I went outside for a cigarette and notice a really long line that resembled a plane exhaust trail, the problem was that my husband could see it too from where he was in Sanford about 10 miles away. It was as far as the eye could see in both directions running in a north-south direction but it just stayed there in a long line. We have always lived near airports and this was not like any vapor trail we had ever seen from planes before. It&apos;s still out there right now as I write this and it has hardly disappated. The wind seems to have no affect on it. It&apos;s really strange. Normally, when a plane goes over you see the trail but it only trails a short distance behind the plane and disappates quickly. This one isn&apos;t doing that. Wish I had been outside at the time whatever it was had passed over. Very strange. Maybe it was nothing but it is just strange enough that I had to post this to see if anyone saw what caused the trail.", "FRIGHTENING MIB ENCOUNTER?The story that I am about to tell you is hard to describe.  I have always hesitated in telling this srange story to many people in the past because they might think that I made the whole thing up, or am crazy.  Trust me, this story is very much true and accurate.  What I saw those two late nights back in 1992 etc. still gives me chills up and down my spine even today.  When I was a very young boy in my teens I had two very real and serious UFO close encounters.  They both happened in Kentucky, and were very much real.  There were other witnessess too.  I remember them both well, and they somehow changed my life forever.  They made a UFO believer out of me.  One was a very powerful loud object and light hovering above me and my cousins one day for several minutes.  Were we abducted?  I cannot remember.  The other sighting was of a very large glowing disk with lights that my Grandparent&apos;s and I saw in the black night sky up close.  The second sighting happened a few years later.  When I got older I left home and moved away to another city to start a career.  I lived alone in a small one bedroom apartment.  Late one night around midnight I was awakened by a very strong sense that someone, or something, was in my apartment with me.  I looked out into the hallway and I was totally astonished, and scared to death, at what I saw.  In my bedroom at the left end corner of the foot of my bed stood a man, a man in total black ( a shadow like person).  The hallway light was on, and his manly form was unmistakable in my bedroom.  I could definately make out the form of a man with an older 1940&apos;s style hat on, and his body outline with an overcoat on too-both completely dark black.  Believe me, this person or thing was really there.  I am a born again Christian, and my honesty is something that I hold in high regard.  I simply could not move-my body was frozen in fear and anxiety.  I quickly glanced outside my bedroom window to see if he was just a reflection from outside of some sort, but their was no reflection.  I opened and closed my eyes many times, and shook my head, to see if I was dreaming.  I shockingly finally realized that I was not.  My heart was beating so fast I could hear it pounding, and I really thought that I was going to have a heart attack.  I could not move, and the man just stood there in complete silence for close to twenty minutes staring at me.  Finally he just somehow vanished in an instant.  It took me an hour or longer to calm down and do a search in my apartment.  The doors were all locked.  About four months later the exact same thing happened again.  I was suddenly awakened, and there at the same location was the same black shadowy man standing at the left end corner of my bed staring at me.  Again I could not move, and was again frozen with fear and anxiety.  My heart was beating again very rapidly too.  This time though I finally managed to ask him who he was, and what did he want.  He just stood there staring at me again for around twenty minutes or so.  Then he just practically vanished again.  Even today I cannot begin to explain who or what the thing was that I saw.  I have heard strange stories of MIB&apos;s (Men In Black) visiting people who have had UFO encounters before, but this was crazy. I had never taken them so seriously before.  Now I wonder.  Anyway, the strange and mysterious man in black never came back to my apartment again-thank God.  I hope that you believe my story.  Yes, I know this story sounds crazy, but it really happened exactly the way that I told it to you.  Something happened to me those two frightening nights beyond my understanding.  I DO know for a fact that the UFOs are real!----JG((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Canada. I was smoking outside looking at the lights from West Vancouver. I seemed rise into the sky and fly toward West Vancouver (toward North from the English Bay). I felt a little strange but thought that it would be a aircraft. When the light came closer to me, I saw a red light on one side and a blue light on the other side. So I was almost sure that it is airplane. Still I could not figure out the shape of the flying object because of the bright light in front. When it passed over me (not exactly above me though), I could see the silhouette of the flying object reflected by moonlight. It did not have a airplane tail or tail wing. It was round shape and I heard the very low and loud &quot;booing&quot; sound. The whole shape looked like a disk with 3 or 4 searchlights in a row side by side in front, a red light on right or left side and a blue light on the other. It did not spin. It just flied over West Vancouver toward Grouse Mountain and disappeared in the dark sky. I do not know how long it lasted for but it was very quick, maybe for a minute.", "On the night of Hurricane Wilma I honestly couldn&apos;t tell you the exact time but I&apos;m guessing it must&apos;ve been at least 8:30pm or so. Of course that night absolutely nobody in my neighboorhood or surrounding neighborhoods had any electricity at all. Most of Dade and Broward counties we pretty much pitch black. I don&apos;t even think anyone in our near by neighborhoods had any generators until at least 1-2 days later or so, and  our area alone went about 2-3 weeks without electricity. That night my 10yr old brother, my mother and I were outside our house in the porch area. We were grilling some food and pulled some chairs out. We were looking up at the skies and really just admiring the stars and how beautiful it looked since you can&apos;t really see &amp; appreciate them in the city. It was really, really dark and had a perfect view of the skies. We were just staring up a few minutes when my mom said look at that star it&apos;s moving. All the other stars in the skies looked normal and in place except this one that was actually moving. We could not see a shape or outline of any sort. I couldn&apos;t say that it looked like a saucer or diamond or anything it just simply looked like a moving star unlike the others. Just a bright light but not abnormally bright and it looked very, very far up in the sky. Of course the three of us just looked at it and followed it&apos;s movement as it was heading north. We were mesmerized and couldn&apos;t take our eyes off of it we kept saying it can&apos;t be a plane because to our knowledge their were no planes flying that night due to the hurricane. And it just seemed so far up I&apos;ve never seen a plane fly that far up before. Then we noticed another moving star behind the first one almost like out of nowhere so here there was two moving stars that seemed to be flying pretty fast and not necessarily in a &quot;perfect line&quot;. I&apos;m not going to say it was doing any crazy twists and turns or anything like that either just not a perfect line and a plane couldn&apos;t make those fast movements. My mom and I just kept saying it can&apos;t be a plane besides there are no planes flying tonight. We kept asking what is that? Do stars move like that?   And if so why are these the only 2 stars moving like this and the others are standing still? My brother kept asking me is that a UFO? We followed it for a good 5+ minutes eventually when it got past a certain distance we couldn&apos;t see past our roof and lost it. But right when we thought we lost it almost immediately after that over our roof we saw what looked like a shooting star. I don&apos;t know much about shooting stars or anything like that but whenever I&apos;ve seen a shooting star or seen it portrayed usually it seems to shoot downward and this shot upwards and it was brighter then anyone I&apos;ve ever seen and almost in a line not &quot;arched&quot;. That could&apos;ve just been a coincidence I don&apos;t know about that I just thought the timing was either weird or perfect. We just kept looking up and kept asking ourselves what was that? Did we just see a UFO? Then when we thought the action was over we continued to look around and I noticed another moving star this one was brither and bigger then other two but it couldn&apos;t be the same one because the other two had just past over going north this one was just approaching us and it was on the west side there was no way it could&apos;ve turned around that quickly in a matter of a minute! I said look  another one up there,my brother asked where?I pointed at it, as I said it was approaching us and this one didn&apos;t look as high up as the other two. He still  couldn&apos;t find it. I told him give me your flashlight. We had one of those long black flash lights like the kind cops use a good bright one  nearby he got it and gave it to me. I turned it on and said see look up there and pointed the lit flash light in the direction of the star. As soon as I turned on the light and pointed in it&apos;s direction the star dimmed it&apos;s lights!It just looked like one of those really dim stars but you could still see it  moving, and he said why did you point at it, it must&apos;ve seen you! Now it&apos;s going to come after us and he actually got scared. Shortly after it dimmed it&apos;s lights it disappeared behind a cloud. This one we only saw about 2-3 minutes. We waited for it to come out the other end of the small cloud but it never came out. And how weird was it that it immediately dimmed it&apos;s lights when I pointed my flash light in it&apos;s direction. My brother kept asking what if it comes back later tonight? Do you think it saw us? He was actually scared and we just told him that if it was a UFO it was gone now. We stayed looking up for another 15 minutes to see if anything else would happen but that was it we didn&apos;t see anything else. My mom&apos;s friend claims that she saw the moving stars also that night. I actually went out the rest of that week every night with my little brother for a couple of hours a night to see if we saw anything else but we never did.I was not scared I don&apos;t know if mom was she didn&apos;t say so. I was more intrigued and mesmerized then anything and I do believe I saw a &quot;UFO&quot; and I&apos;ll never forget that experience. I don&apos;t think my little brother ever will either. He was scared but intrigued also and is now all into UFO stuff which is how we found this site surfing the net.  We still talk about it of course, my dad laughed it off didn&apos;t take us seriously and my husband just said that&apos;s great honey. But the three of us know what we saw and it was not &quot;normal&quot;  it was amazing there was something out there.(p.s. I am open to being contacted if this is of any interest or help of any sort to investigators)", "It slowley flew over the house stoped about25 or 30 yards past the back yard.it was a boomer rang shaped object it made no sound and was completly lit up with lites on the bottem.it turnd completly side ways in an instent rite to its left an set ther for about 30 minites at 9 or 10 feet off the ground. then it started to rise up at a slow speed an then when it got about 50 yards away from us it vanished.                     gratfully yours ((name deleted))", "Strange Red Craft/ UFO NightmaresThis was a really disturbing experience for us.(but also i would like to keep my self annonymous, thank you for understanding)  One night, i forgot the exact day. i do remember the date and year. It was july 1st, 2003. my brother was over his friend&apos;s house. he said he noticed a &quot;red oval object&quot; followed him ever since he noticed it floating over the dark sky. when he arrived home, he was filled with excitement, he yelled &quot;UFO, i saw a red ufo in the sky&quot; Then he told us to go outside to see it. We were in our backyard. There it was, the object looked like a &quot;Red fire ball&quot; floating in the cloudless dark sky. it didn&apos;t made any sounds. thus it floated in a circular rotation. it did this for about 10 minutes. we walked toward a bit. the object seemed to move towards us, that&apos;s when we paniked. we went back inside the house. we were just watching it from our windows. The object didn&apos;t look like a &quot;red fire ball&quot; anymore. it looks rather more like a space ship. the object now looked like a flat pancake, but it looked as two flat bowls were on top on one another.it had many different lights. and different colors. the top lights were yellow, the spinned in a revolutionary way(circular motions)  the bottom lights were blinding yellow and white. the didn&apos;t blink or anything, they just were blinding all the time. Me, my brother and sister were amazed as we watched the craft hover a bit closer to our house. we NEVER saw anything like this. it couldn&apos;t be a plane or helicopter; planes do not hover around in circular motions for quite an amount of time, and helicopters tend to make sound.  anyway, the object was there; a flat pancake looking craft with a bunch of lights. the color of the craft was also metallic. As the craft got closer, we began to panic even more. Me,my sister, and brother were nervous because it was floating closer and closer above our house. so we rushed and closed the windows fast, i was the one who closed the last window and i saw IT very very close above the house. it had so many lights from the bottom area of the craft. i stood still, then after i closed the last window, a Very LOUD humming sound was heard, the whole house shook for about 5 seconds, we froze , not moving, just looking at eachother&apos;s eyes. the whole house vibrating.. and a loud humming sound was heard, even our dog was still when this happened. objects also fell from the counter tops. After those 5 seconds, i looked outside the window and the UFO was gone. We never had this odd experience before. Me, my sister and brother questioned eachother with confusion. we asked eachother &quot;what the hell just happened? did you hear and feel that?&quot; i asked both of them &quot;did you hear that humming sound! you guys didn&apos;t move&quot;  we couldn&apos;t sleep that night, we kept all the lights on in case that weird Object returned, we were freaked out. we were just thinking of it. but this affected me more than it did to them.. After a few days after that Ufo incident, i began having weird dreams. i had these &quot;episode-like dreams&quot;  everytime i would go to bed after this incident happened, i would be afraid of sleeping with the lights off, or even having the window of the bathroom open. Anyway, 3 nights after i saw the Ufo, i had this weird dream:  i layed in bed, after i fell asleep, i was blinded with a realy bright white light. i was laying on the surface. i woke up(in my dream) then i walked for white a long time, i felt fatigue and tired. the light was also foggy. then i noticed something pulled me into corridor. Ok, after that happened, i woke up from my sleep. then i thought &quot;what the hell was that all about&quot;?  the next time,  i had another dream, but the weird thing about this was that, it continued. Ok this is what happened after i fell asleep the next night:  i was pulled into a corridor, i just felt something grabbing my arm, but couldn&apos;t see who it was. The corridor was rather foggy, the temperature felt warm, too. after that, something pushed me to the floor. the floor was warm and moist(something liked a jungle floor) i looked around the area, the area was steamy, foggy.. it had a bunch of wiring around. also it had many many lights and different corridors or tunnels. the area i was in was rather circular and large.  ( i assumed i was in some type of room) after this happened i woke up. Ok, this was getting a bit disturbing, i told my mom about this.. but then again, most people dislike to believe in these things. so i didn&apos;t told anyone else because they wouldn&apos;t listen.. the next night, i didn&apos;t wanted to fall asleep, but i did.. this was the most frightful nightmare i ever had..the dream was the continuation of my dream i said above.. it resulted this:  i opened my eyes, in the same room, but i was laying on top of a surface. i couldn&apos;t move, my legs, arms were weakened. all i saw was a foggy place.. the top ceiling was wiring and lights. this was the same big circular room. All of the sudden, i felt a hand touching my arm. i began noticing sounds around me. then i saw these creatures, About 4 of them.. They were tall, thin, they had slanted blueish eyes(asian looking). they were purplish transparent, No hair or facial features, just a slit for a mouth and two small dots that made out their nose. but since it was foggy, i couldn&apos;t make them up more what they looked like. Ok, this is going to be more bizarre.. the creatures were communicating by making &quot;gargling&quot; - like noises.  then i thought &quot;what the hell is going on&quot;? i was a bit dazed. after i heard their communication, i again... woke up. the last thing i saw was a hand coming close to my eyes. that was the last dream i had about this.. after that i kept drawing things of my dream experience. i do not know anyone with this effect. my sister and brother were also witnesses of the UFO incident that we saw in July 1st, 2003. i asked them if they had nightmare of aliens or ufos or being abducted. they replied with a &quot;No&quot; i guess i was the only one affected. Also, i never met anyone who has gone through this. however, i did see people on television with this same experiences ; &quot;Seeing a UFO, then having ufo nightmares of being abducted in their dreams&quot; after seeing this in television i was shocked.. the t.v. program was called &quot;unexplained mysteries&quot;  that is all i can remember for now. please i would like to keep my self annonymous. I did NOT make this up, i didn&apos;t type all this for the &quot;hell of it&quot; and spent my time in it for nothing.. ALL that was typed above was my personal experience..I do not have any fotographs of the craft i saw.. i just have sketches and drawings of the craft i saw in july 1st 2003 and sketches/drawings of the creatures i saw in my dreams.. thank you for reading and listening. as i said above.. i want to keep my self Annonymous.", "saucer shape   rocked back and forth while moving west   lights on and around bottom of craft   1 was observed   couldnt see a color...too much light   none of the observers believed in flying saucers until we saw it   took a picture but it turned out as nothing but a dot of light   also used a video device with same turn out", "firey balls observed 14 miles west of Gila Bend from Interstate 8 going out and coming onWhile driving from San Diego to Sedona on a trip to Orlando, Florida, my daughter and I video taped two round objects that appeared to flame out and then relight.  At first there appeared to be three atop a mountain and we joked about them going out and coming back on.  As we cleared the mountains they appeared at a long distance on the plain and there were only two of them. My daughter video taped them on the prairie going out but not coming back on, they appear to be ball like with a darkened top.

Unfortunately, I cannot be exact about the date because I was there on both days but it was definitely either the 13th or the 14th. My parents&rsquo; house is on a hill in Christchurch, a small city situated on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The house faces north but also affords excellent views to the east and part of the west due to the fact that it is built on a reasonably high cliff-face. I had gone outside to have a cigarette when I noticed a moderately large sea bird gliding gracefully across the sky on an upward current of wind.  I mention this detail only because of what the observation led to.  The bird swooped up higher than I normally look and as I followed it with my eyes I noticed a strange and very small object very high in the eastern sky.  I was immediately intrigued due to the fact that in the 35 years I have stood on that outside deck I have never once seen an aircraft at either that height or position.  I have seen thousands of planes from that deck throughout my life.  Most travel in a broadly north or north-eastern direction as they travel up the coast and the ones that head south or west are usually obscured from view.  To see a plane in the eastern sky well off the eastern coast of the South Island of New Zealand is very unusual as there is basically nothing but the Pacific Ocean all the way to South America. As I have already mentioned, the object was very high in the sky; certainly higher than any plane I&rsquo;ve ever seen.  In fact, I would never normally crane my neck back so severely if I hadn&rsquo;t been watching the sea bird&rsquo;s arc. I remember thinking to myself &quot;Is this a large object far away or a small object somewhat closer,&quot; and I felt without hesitation that it was the former. I have excellent eyesight and I am convinced that what I saw was neither a conventional aircraft nor a weather balloon. In shape, the object was rectangular more than anything and seemed to be slightly reflecting the morning sunlight as it moved upward and away. There was a thin layer of high cloud above and the object steadily climbed through it (or appeared to) and disappeared slowly over the course of around 20 seconds. It moved at a very gradual pace and had no other distinguishing characteristics. I must reiterate that the object was very small to the naked eye and that my gut feeling was that it was a very long way above me. The reflective nature of the object suggested to me that it may have been of metallic origin. I want to stress the unusual nature of this sighting. I have never seen anything like it in 35 years. My initial assumption was that it must have been the space shuttle but I have not been able to establish whether it would have been viewable at this time and date from my location. I&rsquo;d love to know what that strange object was!", "I watched this event for about 2 hours. It first appeared as a very intense bright light just over the Grifith Park observatory in Los Angelas . It was stationary.We then looked at it through a telescope, it was amazing!!!! It looked like a square inside a sphere, the sphre area looked as if it was spinning and casting off gold light . Inside was this square that looked  VERY machine-like. It looked almost like the surface of a giant computer chip , except that the lines and shapes inside were always moveing and changing. This was NOT a heavenly body or planet!!!! Then very slowly it began to rise, straight up, we continued to observe it  both through the telescope and with the naked eye. It took about an hour or so to just rise untill it looked as it it left the earths atmosphere.It was nothing like i have seen before , it was very differeint and strange and I cant explain it. My friend, whose apartment we watched it from, stated that he has seen it before. I have looked at other reports on here , going back quite aways and there are a few other accounts that sem to describe the smae thing!!! It was also perfectly silent.", "Driving west along sea road (A259) going back to Worthing from Brighton in late May 1997. Looking out to sea witnessed a metalic sphere 500 yards away hovering still about 300ft above sea level. Me, the driver and two other passengers were spectulating on what the object might be. We quickly came to the conclusion that is was a helium balloon, probably from the fairground in Brighton. After 2 or 3 mins however it started to move around slowly in one direction, then in another direction. It would stop then move agaign. We started to get excited and wondered how many other people were seeing this strange event. It was a clear, sunny day so there must have been many. Having read much UFO material myself I was convinced that this object was a craft of some kind, since it followed classic descriptions of previous witness accounts from around the world. However I suppose at this point we were not totally convinced. After about 4-5 mins we saw an unmarked helicopter flying overhead, in what looked like an interception path to the object! My friend thought he saw police markings, but I didn&apos;t notice any. Just as the helicopter got to within about 200 yards of the object it shot off at a steep angle eastwards at an amazing speed that left a brief streak of light, almost as if it had turned into the light itself! At this the helicopter turned round and headed back inland. We were all sober and not under the influence of any drugs. I felt Privileged to witness such an event, but also fairly frightened. I don&apos;t know why none of us reported it at the time, probably because we could barely believe what we had seen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Flashing strobes white and red. Second sight 11:59 PM on 6-17-2006: Noticed a light in the sky that was very similar to a satellite gliding South to North what appeared to be slightly slower than the first object but at a higher altitude.The object appeared to have a steady white light on just gliding through the air.(I like watching the satellites for some strange reason as we get allot of them gliding over our house and we are in the middle of the country.) The best way to describe the light and what it did is to imagine a light bulb 65 watts in the distance just floating through the air. A faint light.Then imagine that light bulb turning and rotating towards you and when it was pointed directly at you it was like a spot light like on a police car.The light was super bright and remained on me for maybe 2 sec. then what appeared to be rotation back down and then very quickly matter of 3 to 4 sec. fade to nothing.I stood there and though that maybe there was a cloud that I couldn&rsquo;t see and wanted to see it again but it was gone.

The light was much brighter than any other stars.  Upon further inspection we noticed that the light was actually emitting several different colors (gold, blue, green red etc).

It was shaped like a fuselage of an airplane and at first thought it to be such. It was very large and difficult for me to deterime just how distant it was. I would guess 2-4 miles. I consider it larger than the biggest of airbusses. I kept looking for a tail fin and tail wings but could not locate either. It was the same for the major wings. This object was segmented into 3 segments. The fore and aft segments were of the same size and color ( silverish-white ). The segment in the middle was approximately 1/3 of their size and white. That would be the part where one would expect to see the major wings of an airplane. I never saw them materialize into wings from my perspective. Other vehicles were around but as usual noone was looking up. I was traveling the entire time and observed it for 1-2 minutes.  It appeared to move a little faster than the largest airplanes I have seen at about the same distance. I am going to guess that this object was about 40 degrees going mostly East to West. The strangest thing about this sighting is that I became disoriented after watching it and I feel that on occasion since then I still have periods of disorientation or confusion, if you will, in my work that is not normally present.

At least that was my initial thought. I continued to watch it because I was sitting at a stop light right next to the hospital and it continued to move slowly and rise as it also appeared to change shape and form an eliptical shape. Then as it continued on to the West, it formed a more rounded shape. My second thought was that it was a large black bird of some sort but the more I watched it and began to follow it, the more I could see it was not. I knew there was something else to this object that was more than just strange. It seemingly began to rise but only noticable because there were points of reference on the ground that made it seem to be going higher. A jet passed a good distence above it. It continued to move West and higher in the sky as I followed it. I came to a point where it seemed to stop moving in a Westerly direction and just continued to move higher while sustianing its rounded disklike shape from my point of view from below it. I watched it for another 15 or 20 minutes until it became so high to a black pin point in the sky and eventually vanishing from sight. There were no lights and no other features to this object that I could observe other than it was black and dementionless as it distorted and changed shape. There was no blure as I could see its edges very clearly eventhough they had the tendency to move into and out of position. This is unlike any UFO I&apos;ve ever seen before and completely silent.", "Black object of indeterminate, constantly shifting shape seen passing over Exeter, NH.The object approached from the west, and maintained a steady trajectory towards the east, curving gently towards the south as it passed. At first it appeared to be an airplane, but it never resolved into any singular airplane shape. Sometimes it appeared to be a biplane flying in an extreme crab, sometimes it looked like a star. From first sighting, its shape was constantly moving, in a rotational manner, with a period of approximately 12 seconds. At its closest approach, it appeared that there were many (c. 20) discrete shapes rotating around the center. It maintained an overall spherical aspect at all times, and the rate of internal motion never changed. One observer saw the rotation as around a perpendicular axis. It seemed that the front of the object shifted its shape less, while the rear (as it travelled) seemed at times to be anemone-like, though with slower motion. The object remained black, never showing any other colors, nor reflecting any light, though it didn&apos;t seem to pass into any sunlight. As it passed, both of us saw what appeared to be a halo around the object, perfectly circular, about a third of the object&apos;s diameter further out from its center. The halo appeared as an indistinct lighter ring, with a slightly darker ring around it. One observer felt it was a lens-like effect. Its apparent speed was comperable to a light airplane, and its apparent altitude was also comperable to where a light airplane would fly, as it remained beneath all clouds. A rain storm had recently passed, and the cloud deck was moderately high - not low, but not as high as airliners travel. One of us grew up around airplanes, and has been obsessed with them in varying degrees for his whole life. He is a musician, and has a strong background in the sciences. The other observer was raised in a very socratic household, where everything is open to question, but where the simplest answer must prevail.", "Clear, round, silvery object with a definate flightpath. Right across the sky. Fast! Faster than any other aircraft around it.During the HAYMEN FIRE, while evacuating from our residence, I was looking out of our windows to the south, south/west, while helicopters were flying in and out fighting the fire, and I saw an extremely bright, round object with a flat trajectory (horizontal flight) moving from east to west at extreme speed. Not at all accociated with the helicopters.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "upstate NY sightingI think I could probably draw it easier than describe it - what caught my attention was the lights coming downward in our direction - i saw it thru the window while we watched a movie. It was going really slow - and the lights were (i believe) blue &amp; white. I went outside &amp; looked at it &amp; heard NO NOISE at all! and even though it appeared to be going slow - it covered a large distance in just a couple minutes it was out of sight. Imagine a hammerhead shark - the &quot;wings&quot; were curved like a partial C, and then the &quot;tail&quot; part was very very short. The wings looked ot be 4 times as long as the little stub of a tail. the lights alternated, one color then the other. It may have been green &amp; blue - very bright. I went outside thinking it was a plane of some sort, and we do have lockheed martin &amp; other military contracter factory -type places, but after seeing it I didnt think it was a plane at all. There was no electrical problems/interruptions - but the satellite went out - as it has been a lot with no weather conditions to cause it.

If one imagines a vaguely metalic, oblong sphere, where the sunlight reflected on it in such a way as to make a &quot;Nike&quot; like swoosh around the edge of it, that would be a fair enough approximation.  The object remained visibile initially only long enough to see the reflection-like swoosh glisten around the edge, then seemed to disappear from sight.Judging from the size of airplanes at that distance and height, the object would have been huge for anything that flies.  My guess is that you could stack up ten or more 747s to get the height and if it was genuinely spherical you wouldn&apos;t still approach the volume.  The only thing I am accustomed to seeing in the sky of that size would be a small cloud.About 1-2 minutes later, from the vantagepoint of the southbound Price curve intersecting into Dobson, another whitish object (the same?) was similarly briefly visible overhead, this time much higher (35-50 thousand feet depending on the actual size of the object) and characteristically smaller to sight.  It had the look of making an upwards arc, in a corkscrew-like motion - that this motion could be perceived in such a short time - no more than a few seconds - would suggest extraordinary speed.  It gave the impression that it was moving so fast that to take one&apos;s eyes off of it even for an instant (i.e.: to pay attention to traffic), one would lose track of it - and in fact that happened.  Assuming both of these were the same object, the first view was from the side while the second was more from below and in the second view it had a rather boxy quality.Despite scanning the sky, no further sightings were made.I live in the Phoenix valley and am familiar with cloud types and formations and their general altitudes, so on a clear day like today I believe I can make reasonably accurate estimations of aerial objects&apos; altitudes.", "UFO in Montreal Cigar shapeWe were walking to my house and we saw in the sky a cigar shape with a glow of a yellow tint.

I look at the sky every night and these were not a satellite or plane I know what they look like and how they move.Also these objects are totaly silent. There was a small private plane nearby this time and I wonder if anyone in the plane maybe saw or reported something?

Then the three began to spead out away from the fisrt one in a triangular pattern. I continued to watch as the three objects fanned out to my guess would be 40 to 100 miles from the original circle. Then the three seperated and began to circle each other over a 2 hour period.This covered approximately 300 to 400 miles of sky.

There was also a man outside on his phone who dropped his phone and stood and stared at he object. its lights were moving in a strange pattern. The lights were much like that of an airplane only much brighter and more crisp. The object shown a white light on my car then took off very slow at first ( still not making any noise) then took off very fast. It slowed down then stopped a few more blocks away and once again hovered. Since that day we have seen many more. I assume it is me, and that i am subject of interest. I use the same way to go to work and the same way to get back home every evening, and since that day I have noticed that I am being followed by not just one but several aircraft, and believe me I know how crazy this sounds, but seeing is believing.  when I stop at red lights they stop too and wait and on four different ocassions my light turned green when it shouldn&apos;t have , the other traffic was still going. this has been happening to me for almost four weeks, I haven&apos;t reported it because i thought i was going nuts. I mean it defies everything i was ever taught. I really don&apos;t understand it.

This was around 10:15 p.m. and we set the chairs up to face out over the ocean to get a good view of the moon rising.  We sat there for several minutes observing the sky as it was a clear, cloudless night.  We carried on a casual conversation as we tried to identify constellations and planets, and two of us even caught a shooting star. Then, suddenly, around 10:30, I pointed up at the sky because a bright orange light had just appeared.  It was stationary for probably 5 seconds and then, almost like a firework, six more (though i&apos;m not sure it was exactly six) orange lights emerged from the first light.  In fact, my first reaction was that it was a firework.  However, the lights did not descend, but instead remained in a &quot;V-like&quot; formation for a few additional seconds. My friends and I immediately discussed whether it could be some strange firework, but came to the conclusion that it could not be for three reasons:  1)The small number of lights and their duration were unlike any firework we had ever seen; 2) There was a firework show going on a few miles up the beach, and it was neither as bright nor did the tallest firework reach a quarter of the height of the orange lights; and 3) The lights were directly over the ocean and would have had to been fired from the water.It was then suggested that it was an airplane, but we didn&apos;t think it could be that.  Firstly, it didn&apos;t move or act like an airplane; the sudden movements and sudden appearance of lights were unlike any airplane I have seen before.  And secondly, airplanes have red, green, and white lights while this aircraft had a single, bright orange light. After several minutes of discussion, some of the lights suddenly appeared again, this time all at once and slightly south of their original position.  It did not appear, however, that the lights were all on the same shit as they seemed to move independantly, sometimes blinking and a few of them oscillating a bit.The final time we saw them was several more minutes later, much further down the beach.  They behaved in the same way, but appeared to have picked up speed.  They were only visible for a few seconds, and that was the last we saw of them.  The event has perplexed me as that same night I witnessed a shooting star, fireworks, a definite plane, and what we thought might even be a satelite- yet this was something completely different than any of those or anything I have ever seen.  Perhaps they were just fighter jets, but it didn&apos;t seem like it to me.  The unusual lights and the sporadic appearances have left me wondering what the source of these lights might have been. After this, the moon had risen and my friends didn&apos;t share the same interest in the lights as I did and do, so we left the beach, but since that point i have been looking for some explanation.", "Cigar shaped object over the McDowell MountainsOn the morning of May 26th 2006 my 16 year old son and I were headed to my mom&apos;s house to give her a ride to the airport, it was 5:00 AM barely getting day light still dark enough that I had my headlights on, we were going east on Cactus Road just west of Tatum Blvd. when my son noticed a strange light in the eastern sky I looked out and saw that it was just over the McDowell Mountains and appeared to be the shape of an L and was a bright orange, there was not a cloud in the sky and I was trying to see if it was something that the sun might be reflecting on but other than the object itself the skies were clear, we watched it as it seemed to remain stationary for about 2 minutes then just disappeared, well I continued East bound when just slightly to the North of the first sighting was a very long cigar shaped object same color bright orange lights as the first object again appearing to be stationary then suddenly started moving slowly east toward the valley in  between the peaks of the mountain. Well by now I had pulled over and we had gotten out of the car when remembering that I had a camera on my cell phone and it was better than nothing I was scrambling to find it in the bottom of my purse, but it was too late as the object started to really move rapidly and just as I raised the phone to take a picture of it  the tail end of it disappeared behind the peak of the mountain. I called a couple of news stations to see if it may have been reported by anyone else and apparently it had not, I also got on the internet to look up photos of other sightings around the world and I did find a couple that look exactly like the one we saw.

The driver was promted to pull over when there was a clearing from the trees.  When we pulled over, we noticed an incredible bright light that was very far away but seemed very close.  The bright light was of an orange/yellow tint.  The object was not moving but rather hovering in one spot.  Shortly after the driver noticed the light was dimming.  After the light dimmed out it turned a very vivid orange color and began to move very fast.  Then as it got further away red lights began to circle the bottom of the craft giving away its shape.  It looked like an upside down top.  While it was moving away we noticed an airplane traveling directly for the object which was so close that we thought they would crash.  Then we noticed three other objects in the sky as the main one got further away.  The other three consisted of a very bright white light that blinked inconsistantly in different blinking patterns, all of which were hovering.  Once those began to move they also began to change color  (mainly red, orange, and yellow).  As they got further in the distance we realized that all four objects were traveling in the same direction.  After the objects were covered by the trees, we began to travel further down the road when the passenger in the back noticed another object towards the left of the road which was a bright red at first and then changed to an orange color.  This light, dislike the others was a clear solid light that clearly changed.  At first the three lights on the objects were horizontal to each other, but the further it got and as the color changed it went to a vertical pattern.  When we could not see it anymore, we then drove to our distination not seeing anything else for the rest of the night.  Strangly while we were seeing all of these objects, there was several planes in the air which were completely different then the other 5 objects we saw giving it a distinct difference between an unknown aircraft and an airplane.  This event lasted between 15 and 20 minutes.", "Two lights came in form the south, SW direction the front light was dimmer and the back light was brighter then the planet Jupiter. Jupiter was up to the left of theses objects. The back light did dime to the size of the front light in a count of 10 seconds A thumbs length at arms length was between these two objects as they moved North NE.. No sound as they flew directly over us I had the objects in my 10/50 binoculars I could no make out anything other then light I lost sight of them when I pulled my binocular off.  Two fairly-dimmed, whitish lights taking the shape of two corners of a triangle, the top and lower left, appeared in the sky.  They headed towards the zenith at a constant speed which seemed to be that of a normal airplane.  As they came overhead, the lower left light turned red and then back to its orginal white color.  About thirty seconds later the lower left light rotated to the front as if the craft was doing a u-turn or somethin of that nature.  After completing its&apos; rotation, the object continued on its&apos; path towards the zenith.  Continuing to watch it became more and more difficult as the lights faded and eventually visuals were lost.  Two lights that took the form of two-thirds of a triangle (when looking at a triangle, they would be the top and the bottom left points) traveled in tandem and kept a uniform distance from one another.  It would be difficult to say how far apart they were, but roughly a thumb-length was between them when holding one&apos;s hand up toward the sky.   They moved in such manner at a moderate pace across the sky.   At one point the bottom light turned red and quickly looped clockwise in a circle.  As soon as this action was performed, the light went back to its original color (a whitish-yellow), returned to its original, uniform place in tandem with the other light (the &quot;top-point-of-a-triangle&quot; light), and both continued to move at the same pace, and in the same direction across the sky.  When both lights were back in tandem, however, each began to fade, and both were out of sight within one to two minutes.", "4 lights racing across the sky, then stop for a split second, one semicircles the others then all take a 90 degree turn and race away.On a perfectly clear starry night we observed 4 objects streaking across the sky from the southwest to the northeast. As they approached, all in the formation changed speed and position with the trailing object second from the right overtaking the other 3. As this happened, all four came to a stop, the one in the lead circled back around, making a right hand turn. This stop and turn took less than a half second. All 4 objects then streaked away to the north/northwest at an incredible rate of speed. The entire event lasted less than 4 seconds, all four objects crossed the entire visible sky in this time. The altitude of these objects looked to be at least at the extreme limits of the atmosphere. To give a relation of the amount of time involved, I saw the objects racing across the sky and told my brother to &quot;Look at that!&quot; and before I could say &quot;meteor&quot; the objects stopped, one in the lead made a semi circle right hand turn to line itself back in the formation and the other 3 made a 90 degree left turn and raced out of sight. Each object was reddish orange in color and roughly the size of a bright star in the sky. None left a trail, they resembled a satelite as it tracks across the sky, but the speed of them along with stopping, circling and changing directions in split seconds leaves this out as anything manmade. A few minutes later, a jet airplane took a similar route but took approximately 7 minutes to cover a lesser portion of the sky, I mention this as a speed comparison only. The only other object I&apos;ve ever seen with comparable speed were shooting stars. None of these stop or change directions though. All the shooting stars I&apos;ve ever witnessed also left a trail. These objects left nothing in their wake, no trail no sound. Just incredible raw speed and manuverabilty. The 4 objects were not trailing one another but were in a formation, roughly equal distances apart and varied speed that changed their position as to which was leading. When 3 came to a stop, it was only long enough for the one that overran the formation to circle back, the 3 that momentairily stopped immediatley resumed the speed from before and raced out of site.", "I was driving on the highway and i looked to my right and saw a bright sphere changing colors from white to green to blue.

I watched it and noticed the object seemed to be completely lighted - from front to back, but no blinking or colored lights, just steadily illuminated. I watched it for a moment and it seemed to stop and hover - I would guess about a mile from where I was standing. It was stationary for about 1 minute then a lighted object dropped from underneath the lighted craft and dropped straight down before looping back up behind the original craft and hovered behind it at the same altitude. I didn&apos;t hear any noise or sounds, other than the faint jet engines of the planes approaching LAX to land. The craft then started moving off to the northeast where it dimmed it&apos;s lights as it crossed the area where incoming LAX traffic began their approach but then illuminated again after a few seconds. The lighted object that dropped from the craft was still in the same location and I never saw it move, but eventually it just became non visible.

It was moving from North to South at a very high rate of speed and at a low altitude, left no con-trail and no other shape was visible except for the light.  The object&apos;s distance from me and altitude made it visible below the top of telephone poles on the other side of the 4 lane road.  It covered the distance between several poles in a matter of seconds. The object then appeared to turn left and upward then disappear.  As we pull out onto Hwy 1 heading south we noticed an object that seemed to be hovering with a strobe light.

It&apos;s a full moon tonight and I was looking at the sky when I noticed a really bright star, seemed out of place.

I noticed that there were many commercial aircraft being diverted from the airspace in which the show was taking place as i saw plane after plane pass i then noticed an object near the airspace in which the planes were flying. At first i thought it was just another plane but then i noticed it was stationary in the sky and there was no sound that i could hear coming from it. The object then dissapeared and reappeared again and then did the same about two times more. I tried to get a video but i could not find the object i was seeing in the viewfinder as the sun was in my eyes and also the object was so small. I instead went to get my Dad who came out but when he did the object was no longer there. I thought no more of it and continued on with the watch for planes in the skies and now i was watching for UFO&apos;s also. This sighting occured at around 1:50pm on July 30th 2006. A few hours past and then at around 4:55pm i noticed an object the same to the one i had seen at 1:50pm going across the sky to the west i aimed my camera and pressed the record button but i did not know were to aim the camera as the object was not appearing in the viewfinder the sighting lasted for seconds and i got some very poor footage but its still footage i would like to show. I have slowed the footage down 18X so you can get a better look the object appears to the top right of the screen and is quite hard to see but if you look closely and view it a couple of times you will see what i am getting at. I am positive that what i saw was not a plane of any kind.

Sam,", "If a picture is worth 1000 words than this one is worth $1,000,000!DISCLAMER: I don&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s or aliens from another world!  So posting this is not easy for me, but this is too unexplainable to keep all to myself. This entire event happened within a five minute period and I had 4 other eyewitnesses. I noticed this object in the sky while helping my son fly a kite in the park. It took me about thirty seconds to realize it was not a kite as it was about 300 feet higher than the kite I was flying. The object seemed to be stationary, but I soon realized that it was slowly moving higher and vertical. As I ran to another friend also flying a kite and asked him &quot;what&apos;s that in the sky&quot; he was baffled as well. I then grabbed my camera and start taking pictures. My camera is expensive and takes great shots but I&apos;m an amateur photographer and could not lock the focus on an object that was moving away, getting smaller and had nothing but blue sky&apos;s and clouds as a backdrop. I took a total of 10 pictures and to my amazement, one out of ten came out perfectly clear (by luck) to reveal something that is very hard to explain. I cannot describe the object other than it looks like a very large white camera with a large lens looking downward with four booster rockets and two fuel pods all of which are perfectly symmetrical in shape!  Yeah, I know; crazy huh?  As I tried to rationalize what it might be, I dismissed that it was a weather balloon, US aircraft, satellite and defiantly not a kite. What ever it was, it wasn&apos;t moving with the wind and it was still visible far beyond the cloud layer meaning that the sunlight was reflecting off of this object. I dare not show or send this photo out to anyone unless they are willing to pay very well for it. If there really are aliens and spaceships from another world, I may have one of few real pictures as proof!  The most logical but still crazy explanation I can come up with other than it being from another world is that some foreign country has developed advance spying technology that can silently hover over American land and then return home at altitudes over 40,000 feet!", "1972 Gigantic incandescent object hovering over Concord Mall - stopped cars - deafening silence, lost time.I was travelling up to Concord Mall on Rt 202 with two friends. We took the scenic route, Rt 92. I was 17 at the time.  I remember we went around the last bend on 92 just before you get to Rt 202 and all these cars were just &quot;stopped&quot; along the curve, in their tracks. We stopped too. We got out of the car and looked up to see this GIGANTIC glowing object, just about where the mall would be, hovering over that spot. It looked like a huge cylinder, with a cone shaped end.  It was glowing bright and incandescent. There seemed to be an electric humming sound, very faint.  That is all I remember.  We didn&apos;t remember going to the mall. I don&apos;t remember talking to the other people who were stopped. I only remember driving home with my friends in silence.There seems to be a huge chunk of missing time during and after the event. I don&apos;t remember ever talking about it after that, except years later I did call one of the friends to ask if she remembered it. She did.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I glanced up at them and observed MUCH higher in the cloudless blue sky a jet plane (we are in the Dallas area so there are LOTS of planes). Hundreds of yards behind it a dark orange sphere was following it. At first I thought maybe it was one of those advertising signs that planes drag but then I realized there was no apparent wire and of course, why just a ball and no words? I pointed it out to my husband and just as I was trying to get him to see where it was it just disappeared into thin air. The plane continued on its way. Maybe what I saw was a child&apos;s balloon and it just popped right after I saw it but then why was the motion in perfect rhythm with the plane?", "Giagantic circle of light emitting smaller light circles of different colorsIn 1992, my classmates and I had just finished our associate&apos;s degree program from the Altos De Chavon The School Of Design in my country Dominican Republic. Most of us were celebrating on the second floor in an open balcony. We were dancing and laughing (not drinking)It was a clear but dark night with few stars here and there. Suddenly, one of my friends screamed at everybody to look at the sky, all of us came rushing to look and when I looked up I saw a huge light that looked like a giagantic moon. This light started to appear closer and closer, and everybody started screaming. I was out of my shocked when my friend yelled at me to use my camara (I was taking pictures of all of us before this happened) I lift the camera and started taking shots like crazy, and in a frenzy went down the stairs to get under that beautiful and giagantic light. when I got down to the patio another of the students was coming from the grocery store and he asked what was going on? I told him to look up and he dropped all the bags he was carrying when he saw the light.  Right next to him and under that brilliant light I kept taking pictures when suddenly this magnificent object started emitting from its center smaller circles of lights of different colors.  It was scary at the beginning, but once I got closer to it I felt just amazed of its size and beauty.The sighting lasted about 5 to 8 or ten minutes (I&apos;m not sure) All I know is that it was the second sighting of my life and I felt really lucky to be witnessing such as an amazing &quot;thing&quot;. I took my camera to develop the pictures from that night, and I got all the group pictures except the ones I shot at the light.

Witnessed by lab personel as well as 3 physicians and nurses. About 15 witnesses in all. The flying object entered from southeast at rapid rate and came to immediate stop over the city of Boise. It appeared to be at the same altitude that we were watching from, which was probably 2 0r 3 hundred feet higher that downtown area. From our position it appeared to be directly over the State Capitol. From our position, one could not determine its exact shape, because we had mostly a side view. It would be like looking at a disc from its side view. Its height to widith ratio would be like 1 to 300. It appeared to be either metallic or glasslike in nature. I was much longer than any commercial aircraft. It refracted colors sequentially along its entire width, and looked like how windows look from a distance when sunlite refracts off their surface. When it departed, it instantly accelerated at a phenonmenal speed and disappered over Bogus Basin to the north of Boise, about 20 miles from the city. It had no gas trail, and of course we were too far from the object to determine if there was any noise. The peculiar fact was there was nothing in the local news after the event. I was asked to call airport and see if they had it on radar. I walked over to the lunchroom checkout counter and used the public phone and called the Boise tower. I was given a UFO report number at Mountain Home air force base and made the call. I cannot recall to whom I spoke, but it was an officer, and he was anxious to receive all the information. After speaking with him for about 5-10 minutes, and answering all his questions, I asked him he he could confirm this sighting. He replied, that they had picked up the object somewhere south of Salt Lake City and had lost it as it moved toward the North Pole. He also willing told me that the object&apos;s speed was in excess of 6500 miles per hour. He said that the airforce had nothing in its arsenal near that speed. he thanked me and I have never told this story to the public before.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first I thought it was an airplane because I saw a center white light with two smaller lights on either side of the object, like landing lights on wings.  Also, I could tell there was at least one blinking light on the bottom, which appeared red.  As I got closer I could tell the object was stationary at an altitude of approximately 300 feet and a distance of perhaps a &frac14; mile off of the highway. When parallel to the object I could tell this was definitely not an airplane, due to being stationary, and definitely not a helicopter, due to several bright white lights being on top of the object as well.  At this distance I could still not determine the exact shape of the object, but could tell that it had very intense white lights on all surfaces, a red blinking light on the bottom and perhaps a blue blinking light on the bottom.  Due to the blinking lights I was not very suspicious since blinking lights usually signal to me that it is some type of known aircraft. As I continued south I saw 11 more of these objects, all between mile marker 70 and 50, for a total of 12.  All had the same description as the one above and all were stationary between 200 and 400 feet off the ground and from &frac14; to 1 mile off to the left the road.  Most were somewhat equally spaced in distance as I traveled down the road, but I saw one occurrence of 3 in a triangular pattern with a distance of maybe a &frac14; mile in between each.  This area of Ohio is mostly flat open farmland with small gatherings of houses and buildings (maybe 4 or 5 in a group).  All of these objects seemed to be above these groups of houses. When I approached mile marker 50, I hadn&apos;t seen one of these objects in perhaps 5 miles when I suddenly noticed one off to the left again but this one was moving parallel to I-71.  After a mile or so the object turned southeast and left the area very quickly, followed closely by 3 more of these objects.  They finally faded out of side just before mile marker 50.  I believe these to be objects that I had previously seen so I did not add them to my count.  This was the last I saw of these objects that morning.  I was heading out of state at the time and returned at the end of the week.  While out of town I thought about what I had seen and came upon the idea that these may have been the tops of radio or other communications towers and I would look for these the next time I traveled through the area.  I was skeptical of this idea however since I looked for frames under the lights but could not see anything. On Friday, June 16, 2006 I traveled back through the area at approximately 10 p.m. going northbound.  I began watching the skies around mile marker 50 to see if any of these objects remained.  I saw several radio towers, but all of these had blinking red lights along their frames and these frames were easily visible in the dark.  I approached mile marker 60 near Jeffersonville and still had not seen anything when I noticed 2 lights on the left side (west this time) of I-71 and they looked very similar to what I had seen earlier in the week.  These lights were still about 5 miles ahead of me perhaps around mile marker 65. As I got closer I could see the lights better and they were on the west side of 71 approximately &frac14; mile apart and much to my surprise, one was slowly moving out overtop 71.  Even more to my surprise I knew I was going to be driving directly under the object.  The object was a very pronounced ((??)), with large circular blue lights running along the entire bottom of the shape, perhaps 6 or 7 on each length of the &quot;V&quot;.  On the tip of the object, there was a flashing red light on the bottom.  The leading edges of the object were covered with bright white lights as well as the top. I was not the only person to see this object, since I noticed several truckers and motorists looking up.  Realizing that I was now going only 40 MPH as well as a few people around me, I became aware that this object could perhaps cause an accident.  Because of this fact, and the fact that I now needed a new pair of pants, I called the State Police and talked to the sergeant on duty at the Wilmington branch.  He was very professional and said he would have a trooper report to the area immediately. I do not know if anything was ever reported by the State Police, or if anything else ever came of the situation, I left the area very quickly and have only been back through during the day.  If anyone doubts my thoughts and views on this matter, please let me give you a bit of my background so perhaps you can understand my reasoning.  I am a mechanical engineering student at the University of Cincinnati, so I understand the basics of what is and isn&apos;t possible with aircraft.  I grew up near the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida where my father was stationed with the Marines in the air wing.  Over the years I have seen my share of aircraft fly ranging from biplanes, WWII era prop fighters and bombers, to modern day fighters and bombers including the F-117 Stealth fighter, B-1 and B-2 bombers, and specialty aircraft such as the SR-71 Blackbird and UAVs such as the Predator.  Besides fixed wing vehicles, I have also seen several examples of helicopters from Loaches, Hueys, Blackhawks, Apaches, Cobras, and Chinooks, to private crafts like Medivacs, and other Search and Rescue craft.  Being from East Central Ohio I have had my encounters with blimps (Goodyear) and with hot-air balloons too. I know that this area that I was traveling through is in the approach and exit patterns for Wright-Patt Air Force base and Port Columbus International, but I have never seen any fixed wing aircraft that can hover or move as slowly as these objects did, or any other aircraft with this distinct shape and light pattern.  Hopefully someone else saw these events too.", "Fast moving lightI was doing some backyard astronomy with my father-in-law. I had been viewing jupiter and we were looking to the south. I noticed a light orange colored light moving from North to South at a high speed. I estimated that it must have been moving much fast than a normal aircraft but not so fast that I ruled it out as such. It appeared to be at a very high altitude. I had a pair of bushnell 12X50 binocs handy and I was able to get a good look. There seemed to be two lights. One big one in front and one tiny one in back. I did not see any red or blue lights on it nor did I see the normal type of strobe that are on most aircraft. I asked my father-in-law what he thought it was and he didn&apos;t know, but he said he thought that it zig-zaged a little. I must have been messing with my binocs so I did see that and plus it is hard to hold steady when you are looking at a distant object with binocs. A few seconds later the craft vanished as if it when behind some clouds but there were none. I am certain it was a cloudless night because as most people know clouds affect astronomy. It almost looked like it left the atmosphere. Could have been a plane but it was very odd for one.", "Fluorescent-green parallel ceiling lights in line formation flying north of Dundee WisconsinPulsating lights two per object, green in color, having length and shape similar to a pair of fluorescent ceiling lights, (parallel to each other) running longitudinally in direction of travel. Object appeared solid when viewed through a pair of 10x50 binoculars during lapses between light pulsations. Shape could not be recognized. A single object with pulsating green lights (as described above) was visible traveling approximately 025 degrees true, (compared against the position of Polaris with the chair of Cassiopeia in the North-east sky), followed in less than a minute by two more identical objects in rough trailing formation. The last two objects were visible for three minutes through binoculars over a hill with an estimated topographic crest of 200 feet above base terrain. Estimated speed of 24,000 feet per minute when the course was measured against a satellite image of the area. In the next hour and a half solid green intense single points of lights were visible, having the color and intensity of an emerald laser or targeting laser of Russian design moving in an approximate arc from Southeast to Northeast, but these did not appear attached to a solid object as the first three objects and on occasion emitted an aura or laser-like luminescence that rotated or changed relative position to the point of light intensity. The speed of these lights appeared slower than the first three objects, but altitude, distance and speed were difficult to estimate. All appeared height above the high terrain to be approximately 5-6 inches when measured at arms length. All solid lights appeared remarkably in the same airspace (course and altitude) over the duration of their individual observations. None of the objects or lights produced audible sound, were devoid of conventional aircraft running lights, and were radically different in appearance from aircraft, satellites, meteors and other normal night sky occurrences visible that evening.

Just after we turned off of rt.1 (coastal highway) onto John J. Williams Hwy. right before we crossed over the bridge at Love Creek we got about a 20 sec. glimpse of an oblonge, saucer-shaped object in the sky right in front of us.  The object was glowing with a bright flourescent green color and had a hazy tail behind it.  It was flying vertical at a high speed and disapeared suddenly.

We were laying down on the trampoline in the backyard so that we could comfortably survey the stars and possibly catch a glimpse of any sort of celestial movement. Such as, shooting stars and ironically UFOs. We were both smoking Durahm Black clove cigarettes as we lay there while making idle chatter about many subjects. Including but not limited to, me giving him advice on a biblical teaching he had to give to his local fellowship, the topic being, &quot;fearless living,&quot; also, talking about whether he made out with his girlfriend on the trampoline, just idle chatter. Every now and then, one of us would say, &quot;did you see that shooting star?&quot; At 11:45 pm we noticed two objects heading due east. They were flying at the same speed and were obviously flying in formation. I heard no sound from them but my friend said he could hear slight movement of the air. The appearance was, oval and conical at the ends, to me it appeared like I was looking at the bottom of a wider-than-usual boat. The craft were lower than an airplane, we could tell that much. They flew right over head. These objects appeared to slowly move across the sky, but must&apos;ve been moving much faster than any aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen, seeing as it took them less than 20 - 30 seconds to appear in sight on the west clear sky and disappear out of sight into the eastern sky. We lost sight of them mainly due to the glow of the city light. We probably could of still saw them for another 5 to 10 seconds at the speed they were going. One of them remained at a steady course but the one on the left wobbled at somewhere in the middle of the trip. And after it wobbled it moved closer to the other craft. The color of these craft were a faded peach-orange color. There was a haze around the objects as well.

I became stunt for few seconds then i turned about and grab my cousin&apos;s arm who was standing directly infront of me and told him to look at that direction and then i found the thing disappeared. i never got to tell anyone because i thought no one here would believe me. i live in brunei and this place is a small country so maybe there&apos;s lesser chance for me to meet someone who have seen similar things. i was surprise to find this website where i can share with everyone who probably would have the encounter the same thing. Even today i never got to tell much people here because im worried they will think im NUTs :0  from my memory, i remember that the object was not the typical saucer look which we always get on TV/indepandent day/internet/discovery channel.It was something different. it was very high-tech and unique. it is nothing like what i&apos;ve ever seen in any movies. There were many details on the body of the craft as if it looks like pipes / wiring attached to the body. from the distance where i was standing, i consider the object small. probably measuring about 4 to 5 feet lenght x  4 feet width x 3 to 5 feet thickness. no lights were seen. i can see that object with available lights because i was close enough from that subject as the house had some lightings around the surrounding of the garden to lite up some part of the roof. The stangest thing i canot figure out how it can do was; the object was actually floating on top of the roof (probably less then a feet away from the roof), the roof were soft and old and it should have made noise. even rain drops falling onto the roof would make noise but from my distant i hear nothing from the object and the roof (the corner part) was not even rattling. after that incident i&apos;ve always wish to see it another time.i told some of my friends i wish to see them again. i consider myself very lucky to see it that close because from documentary, discovery channels, books, internet sites, videos...all those who said they have seen are from a very great distant and they can&apos;t really judge how it look like. most of them say its like a saucer. but for me, it can look like anything.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was not moving as fast as the clouds were, almost still.  It must&apos;ve been several miles up, very far away, since I was not able to make out a shape at all.  I got off the phone and continued to watch it when it disappeared right in front of my eyes.  I was surprised at that.  Then, a few moments later, about 10 degrees east, it reappeared.  It stayed in that position for a few minutes.  I looked away for just a moment and looked back and it was gone.  I searched the same area of sky to make sure my eyes weren&apos;t just straining and it was definitely not there anymore.  After several minutes of searching the rest of the sky I was sure that it had gone, at least from my sight.  It was definitely not a weather balloon or traditional aircraft.  I was perfectly coherent and awake.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I&apos;ve kept the tape since &apos;94.  I contacted Art Bell about it a few times but received no response.  This is what happened.  My Grandama lives in Delaware County Ohio.  It is in the country.  One night her neighbor from 1/2 mile down the road called her(around 9 pm)and told her that her husband had been in the field on a tractor working and he saw some UFO&apos;s heading towards my Grandma&apos;s house.  At this point, my Grandma grabbed her VHS cordcam and went outside. By this time, her neighbor came down.  They then watch and converse about the happenings.  I will dictate what takes place in the video:  My Grandma and neighbor says,&quot;  they almost look like searchlights, but why would they come together like that&quot;.  At this time in the video, you see four tear-shaped objects, glowing a soft yellow, coming together to make one bright object with many rays coming from it, however you can still distinguish each object.  Then they break apart and head to different parts of the sky.  At this point, beams of the same color shoot down into the back woods.  I have periodically look at this video.  My brother and I used to watch it frame by frame.  The objects move at incredible speeds.  They wil disapear and reapear in a different spot, and THEN you will see the streak/travel path left behind!  Also, at one point you see the fifth object which appears in the upper right corner of the video.  It is long and rectangle with very soft edges, not luminecent like the others.  You can also see a row of windows that are darker than the rest of the ship.  At that time, I was 14.  My brother and I began to research it. We found pictures of the likeness of our ships in the &quot;Gulf Breeze Sightings&quot;.  They even had a pic of the rectangle ship we saw.  They called it a &quot;cigar-shaped&quot; ship, and go on to call it the &quot;mothership&quot;.  Anyways, I figured I would tell one last person.", "3 objects interacting over DE CityA Co-worker and I observed 3 objects rotating around one another at first,and then fly off in seperate directions.1 blue sphere-shaped craft,1 rectangular craft that seemed to be going end-over-end as it hovered and then disappeared,and 1 small black disk shaped craft that moved rapidly eastward after about 10 minutes interacting w/ the other objects.Blue sphere hovered above and then below the clouds,in and out of sight,for a few minutes after other objects left.It finally ascended out of view upon arrival of military helicopter,possibly a Blackhawk from Dover AFB.", "Strange orange lights over the river at Alymer&apos;s marina, in Quebec CanadaHi,  Around 10:30 p.m., on June 24th, at Marina Aylmer (Quebec, Canada) I have seen an orange light over the river. There was no flashing light as usually associated with plane or helicopter. The light was very bright, many times brighter as the brightest star in the sky. There was no clouds at all. The air was humid. The size was about 20 to 40 times the one of a star. At first sight, the object has seemed a few hundred feet above the water. I was unable to distinguish any shape. It was stable with no noticeable sound. It has stayed at a fixed point into the air during about two or three minutes. Then it has moved slowly from right to left, near vertically, and went up in the air slowly until it has disappeared completely into the sky, very high as a tiny spot. My young boy and my little girl were with me they has seen exactly the same thing as me. Two other people passing by have asked us what it was. They were curious as us? I think it was pretty near of us near the Quebec&rsquo;s river side. At around 11:00 p.m., we have observed the same thing but farther away from Aylmer&rsquo;s marina. It was looking like to be near the Ontario side of the river. We have seen two light, less bright because further, but it has had the same moves. First, these light were low in the horizon, then it has disappeared the same way has in our first observations. These two lights seemed to be near of each other. We have seen another light still further away that has the same characteristics. I think other people should have seen this, because there was many hundred people there during this evening, because the summer activities there.", "Moving stars that lost their light and reappeared.I love to watch the night sky pretty much anywhere I go.  I am educated on what jets, stars, planets, meteors, and satellites appear as in the night sky.  I have never seen anything like what I had saw that night.  It was a beautiful night, not one cloud in the sky, so what I had seen was in plain view and was not obstructed in any way.  I was looking up at the sky frequently because there were many meteors in the sky.  Then something struck me as odd; a faint star, but it wasn&apos;t twinkling like a star should, so I thought it was a planet, but I noticed similar ones close by it.  That struck me as odd because I had never seen so many that close to eachother.  Suddenly, one just stopped emitting light, and I could see it move away while its light was fading until it became too dark to see any more.  It moved very smoothly.  The others soon quit emitting light (seperately) as well, although I could see that only a couple had moved like the first.  This is when I got my mom&apos;s attention.  I took her away from the glare of the fire and told her to look where I had been looking.  She soon saw what I had seen and grabbed her boyfriend to see.  I began to look where the things had moved in the sky.  I caught sight of what may have been the same ones that had started emitting their lights again, or completely new ones.  I hadn&apos;t noticed one particularly bright one (not twinkling) forming a pentagon with the cup portion of the big dipper.  The first faded sightings didn&apos;t give me enough proof within my own thoughts to label them UFOs, but this one shook me.  When it was emitting light, it was completely motionless.  It stopped emitting light like the others, but that one was so bright, it probably took a full second for it to completely fade out.  It began moving away from its position as soon as it stopped emitting light, and for that split second of fading light, I could clearly see structure.  I have absolutely no doubt that that structure was emitting the light I had mistaken for a bright planet and that it moved on its own accord.  They could not have been stars because they were not twinkling.  They could not have planets because they were too many, they turned off, and they moved.  They could not have been jets because they did not blink, and they were motionless for a long time.  They could not have been satellites because they had stopped emitting lights for a long time, and they were motionless.  They could not have been meteors because they could last for a matter of minutes, as opposed to a few seconds.  Once again, I am educated about what shines in the sky.  My mom, the other witness, was the one who had taught me these things.  I am 17 years old.  My mom is in her thirties and is an eighth grade teacher.  I don&apos;t lie and I don&apos;t mislead.  Also, just so you know, there was no alchohol in that portion of the trip and I wouldn&apos;t drink it anyway.  I usually doubt myself about things like this, but it was so blatant.  With all the information at hand, I have come up with three theories.  The one that would not go beyond what is normally accepted as normal would be that, for some reason, there were many planets out that night, and that there were clouds that I hadn&apos;t noticed.  Then those clouds, blown by the fast winds of Seminoe, blocked those planets; maybe creating some sort of optical illusion that the planets were moving.  This is unlikely because I am sure that there were no clouds out that night and once the things stopped giving off light, they disappeared for good.  Also, because they were so close together, it is unlikely that a tiny cloud could blot them out one at a time.  My second theory is one that is always considered when you think see things like this; visitors.  Their ships were in or just outside our atmosphere, using either their own powerful lights, or reflecting the light from the sun (much like the moon and the planets do) to create the illusion that they are only stars.  My final theory has to do with a state of the art government spying weapon.  This would be the perfect spying tool.  Our enemies would never think that the stars were spying on them.  If these things were man-made, one can only hope that they are those of our own government, and not an enemy&apos;s.  I hope I have made things as clear as they can be made on paper and helped you do whatever it is that you do.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was still the first inning. Pedro Martinez had hit a batter and forced a run in, the Phillies catcher was up. I believe the time was about 7:40 P.M. I went into the livingroom to close the blinds and I saw a square shaped object moving from north to south. I overlook the Verrazno Bridge supporting towers and the object was somewhat above the height of the supporting towers. The object was square in shape and moved at about the speed of a dirigible. Not seeing an airplane in the area, I went back to the bedroom and got my glasses. I thought that the object might be a box kite but I discounted that because of the height. Back in the living room I saw that the object was now closer to the bridge. It was grey with a black design of some sort along the top and bottom. When it reached the area of the tower closer to Staten Island the object turned to its right, to the west, and continued in that direction until I could no longer see it. When it turned I could see that it was narrow. I thought that it might be an advertising banner being pulled by a plane but, as I indicate above, there was no plane in the area. I then thought that it might be a weather balloon despite its shape but a balloon could not turn as it did. I estimate that I am about 1 1/2 miles from the Brooklyn side of the bridge and the object was another 1/2 mile to 1 mile beyond that. Unfortunately, I own neither a camera nor binoculars.

The lights just seemed to appear out of nowhere. They flashed from orange to yellow to white, almost like the afterburner of a jet. We could then faintly see the outline of the object, which appeared to be either cigar-like or saucer-like. Upon lighting up after a few seconds, they then converged symmetrically into one object, which seemed to fade away in the distance. Approximately 10 to 15 seconds later, the object reappeared in the same exact spot, but only as one bright orange/yellow/white light. Then it just faded away again.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The object was coming straight down right above my head.  I noticed that it was cylindrical - It looked like a fat cigar kind of shape.  It was very, very bright silver and it seemed seamless. As it was dropping it was going round and round on itself.  It then hung motionless in the sky for about 10 seconds.  It then tipped as airplanes do when they take off.  It picked up an incredible amount of speed and then just disappeared - One second it was there the next it was just gone.  It had no sound at all.

The bigger of the objects that stayed in view at all times was a reddish and blue color. The others were bright flashing white lights. The objects would emit beams of white light back and forth to one another. This activity went on for about 30 to 35 min.

They were  elongated, triangular and three dimensional. They were utterly silent. The objects did not seem to have any orientation bias in their flight. They tumbled or flew in  any direction  as they tumbled on all axis&rsquo;s. They seemed to have mass and were subject to momentum because turns appeared to be rounded  arcs instead of right angles. Starts and stops were linier and fluid. I had no way to judge scale but speeds were fast. Perhaps 5000 mph and I assume since there was no sonic booms, they were out of atmosphere.  They gave me the impression of water bugs  skating on the surface tension of water. They all shared the same colors of red, yellow and green and appeared as though they were backlit in some way. They flew back and forth in a small part of the sky  appearing to be separated into two groups and flying through each other&rsquo;s positions almost like dog fighting but without any fire. Looked like they were playing.  The sighting lasted for about an hour. I never really thought much about it over the years but about 2 years ago, I saw one of the same craft spinning across the sky.

While looking and pointing excitedly at the all these dots of lights, i also noticed an airplan crossing in front of these group of lights,it appeared to be high enough that one could not discern the kind of plan it was except that it was metalic.At this point, about ten minuts past since i first notice the first light, my neck and my eyes were strained and i had to go into the restaurant (because the lunch buffet was closing at 3pm, which was in a few more minuts). After serving and placing my food on the table, i went back out and notice that the original light was still moving slowly to my right away from the group and was relatively about five times larger and brighter than the other lights. After a minute or two, it appeared to stop moving, and again i had to go back into the restaurant, figuring, that i will finish my lunch and go back to keep track at these strange light formation, but about five minuts later when i was out again, there was nothing in the sky other than the usual low flying private plans.", "Luminous disks slowly moving north in the sky over Colorado highway 17At 2300 hours, on July 12, 2006, driving along highway 160 in south central Colorado heading towards Interstate 25 on my way back to Aurora after meeting with a client in Alamosa, I saw 3 luminous disks slowly moving in the sky to the north of me where highway 160 and highway 17 meet.

No stars, no blue-black color that one see&apos;s normally as the color of night sky unless you live away from city lights etc.The whole entire sky was filled with this huge black opaque object as far as I could see in all directions. Then through the branches of the tree that I was standing under,set of lights appeared in a chevron shape with a larger reddish orange with a glimpse of yellow lite was in the center of this chevron shape of different colored lights. It was so huge and looked as though it was traveling no more than 30-40 miles per hour. I remember thinking to myself as to what&apos;s keeeping this ship from just falling out of the sky. Going way to slow to not fall out of the sky. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I could see the real actual night sky with all the stars in the drk-blue black setting. As it continued passing over, I could see the enormity of this thing as it traveled in a north west direction towards the city of Antioch, Fairfield, Vacaville, Santa Rosa and eventually to the Pacific coast. As it was leaving my area, I was estimating the altitude with the telephone poles in the area. This &quot;Mothership or whatever took up at least a 3-4 block sq. area and maybe more at an altitude no more than 300 - 400 ft in the air  and was so quiet (not a peep)it was noisy.

But then again, it may have been simply nothing more than a plane traveling East. On June 12, 2006 at 6:45AM in the city of Pensacola, I was at work and looking out through the building&apos;s tinted windows watching the tropical storm Alberta&apos;s clouds moving parallel along the Gulf coast.  I find it interesting to watch these clouds traveling along in bands staying somewhat together as it rotates around the storm&apos;s center.  While watching these clouds, I noticed a big, bright object within the clouds   When I first saw this object, I thought it was a bright star that has yet to dim away as the sun slowly rises higher up in sky.  But that couldn&apos;t be because the sun was already up too high in the sky for any stars to be showing.  The estimated distant from my observation location to the star-like object was no more than a half a mile at the most.  I also noticed that the star-like object was moving at the speed of a small plane, and it was traveling at about the same low altitude as other planes I had seen flying though the area in the past.  In the beginning when I first spotted this star-like object,  it was hard to tell that the star-like object was moving because it was traveling East directly in the path  that the clouds were traveling West.  The intensity of the light stayed mostly the same throughout the viewing as the star-like object traveled away from me except for one moment in it&apos;s travel; it appeared to shine brighter for a few seconds as though some sunlight has reflected off it.  After observing it for a about 10 seconds, I begin to think that it might be a meteorite traveling horizontally, so I calmly shouted to my coworker, &quot;Look guys... there&apos;s a meteorite!&quot;  Everybody rushed to the window and saw what I was seeing.  Then my supervisor said, &quot;It&apos;s probably just a plane.&quot;  Then another coworkers said jokingly, &quot;It might be a UFO.&quot; Then I said to my supervisor, &quot;Yea...  Your probably right.  It could be a plane.&quot; Then my boss told everyone to go to work.  I was disappointed at hearing that because I wanted to continue watching this object until it went out of view. I was only able to view it for about 30 seconds. The only time I seen a plane light up somewhat like a bright star is when it&apos;s windows reflected the sunlight for a brief moment, but still, that doesn&apos;t even come close to comparison to the star-like object&apos;s light intensity which was similar in light intensity as to arc-welding type of light. This star-like object stayed lighted up like a bright star throughout the viewing.  It could have been possible that a plane that was not painted and made of bare, shiny metal flew through the area, and the sunlight  reflected off the plane&apos;s body, and then when the plane reached a certain area in the sky, more sunlight could have momentarily reflected off the plane&apos;s window thus giving it the appearance of becoming brighter for a brief moment then returning back to it&apos;s normal brightness.  The object, in my opinion, was close enough to my observation point that I should have, at the least, been able to see a shape similar to a plane if was a plane flying in the air.  Since I could not see any details that could identify it as a plane, my assumption is it could have been anything traversing the sky.  I don&apos;t think it was a meteorite because it didn&apos;t have any flaring tail. If the object I saw was a plane, this would make it the first time I ever saw a plane stayed lit up like a star at close range while traversing the sky.  I seen planes flying through the area in the past at about the same hour,  but they never lit up like a star.  It would usually light up as to something bright white.  Whatever, I saw it, so I&apos;m reporting it.  I&apos;ll let those who are reading this determine what I saw.

Light Pair exhibiting impossible aerial behaviour, &amp; not fitting air traffic profile.This occurence was several months ago, but only recently did I become aware of a place where it could be &apos;reported&apos;. The UFO&apos;s came to my attention as I stepped outside my front door for some fresh air, out on the eastern sky I noticed two single orange lights, and my first thought was plane. DFW airport isn&apos;t more than a half hour away so air traffic passes through quite frequently, but as I examined the two lights their behaviour and the lights themselves on each of the sources became odd to me. I quickly dismissed the profile of plane as for many reasons. The objects lacked the blinking red tail or wing lights, their behaviour as well seemed more like a helicoptor as they kept no straight path and would change direction quite erraticly. My mind finally assumed them to be UFO&apos;s as their speed was somewhat impossible for a helicoptor to match, they weren&apos;t jets by any means but how quickly and easily they flew through the air and changed direction almost on the fly kept me questioning. It was impossible for them to be planes, and if they were helicoptors then the only way the dominant lights could move so fast was if they were infact closer to me than I&apos;d assumed. Of course had they been closer I would of been able to hear the engines. The perceived altitude, the fact that only one light could be determined, the behaviour, they just couldn&apos;t be defined as anything man made that I had knowledge of. Wishful thinking has me hoping that they&apos;re the latest technology we&apos;re not being told about. Like the Blackbird and the wave of stealth fighter development that had people pondering years ago.For anywhere from five to ten minutes I stood on my porch scratching my head as I watched these two lights. They appeared to be a pair, as well, as they stayed within close proximity to each other, they kept their maneuvers in a small patch of sky for most of the time that I witnessed them. As I was about to head inside to get a second opinion on what I was looking at, the two lights parted ways as one went farther out of sight and dropped below the horizon, and the other shot at a remarkable speed off to the north and out of sight. For a person who lives near an airport, and sees planes and helicoptors on a daily basis, I found for the first time something in the air that had me vexed.

It was late evening after a baseball game between 8 and 9:00 at night.  After several years of denial, my father recently confirmed that he too witnessed the following events. After leaving the local convenience store heading towards Leonard, I noticed a cylinder like object hovering nearby.  From my perspective, the object appeared to be the size 18-wheeler.  The object was stationary for about 3 minutes and proceeded to parallel us as my father drove towards downtown. We followed the object for about 10 more minutes towards Leonard.  We continued seeing the object moving slightly faster than we were driving.  About half way between Trenton and Leonard, the object moved south west over an empty field, staying at the same altitude, and rapidly moved upwards vanishing into the night sky. It did not resemble the traditional UFO flying disk shape.  The object was shaped like a flattened blimp.  My father described it more as an elongated egg.  I remember that the object was red with many lights--red, white, and possibly blue).  The object was glowing with a dim red.  The edges of the area were glowing a darker red.  Additional red lights flashed in a random pattern at the bottom of the object.  The white lights were along the side of the object.  I believe that the blue or green lights also were along the bottom of the object as well. At the initial sighting when the object was hovering, the object appeared to have a metallic-like texture with at least one horizontal crease.  It&apos;s hard to describe, but the object was more than a form of light; it had an odd, wavy, gridded, metal-like texture to it.  The white lights did not appear round, but rather small squares.  In retrospect, the white light may have been the illumination of the horizontal crease.  The lights also did not appear to illuminate the surrounding area.  I could not see any wings or propellers--as would be on a helicopter.  The object did not make any sound and despite how close it was.  It also did not disturb any of the surrounding trees.  A helicopter that was as near as this object was would have been audible and disturbed the branches on the surrounding trees. Again, these events occurred many years ago and I wish that I had made a more detailed observation of the events at the time.  However, I was a child at the time and only recently had these events confirmed by my father who was reluctant to discuss these events.  It would be incredibly helpful if others could guide me in the research of this event and other events similar to this.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It looked like a headlight that had turned on- then off.  It flashed once more and it was over.  Kind of like when kids are playing Morse Code with flashlights.

Saucer craft remained motionless in the sky.It has been a long time, but it still haunts me, or intrigues me; I&apos;m not sure.  I had just picked up my ex-wife from school in Ontario, CA. An hour, or so past dusk. It had been several months since we moved from the Chino farm home we were renting, to live with my parents to save money.

Although the light surrounding it resembled the moon&apos;s corona, it was clearly oval in shape, and some sort of craft.  I looked forward, as I was driving and there was the moon in front of us.

After we realized the light was not following us we decided the vehicle must have lost control in the curve and that we should go back and help if we could. We turned around and returned to the last location of the light.  As we slowed and searched both sides of the road, a intense yellow light entered our vehicle causing my friend to drive into the drainage ditch on the side of the road. Observers 1. UPS Driver 2.

It was dark (10:08 pm), when suddenly, just to the left we saw a very bright set of multiple lights ahead of us.  They had suddenly appeared out of nowhere and were very large, guessing approximately 6 blocks above.  The lights were shaped in a curved like boomerang or curved triangle shape.  We could not see an object because of the darkness, but these lights very clearly were outlining something. The lights seemed to glide slowly to the right, as if the object was moving very slowly.  The distance was much, much lower than an airplane would fly, yet, still off the ground some distance.  The lights were white, but my afterthought recollection remembers some hue of orange.  The lights appeared to suddenly begin to fade away as the group of lights in unison, tilted to the right, and amazingly, it was gone as fast as it appeared, it seemed to simply fade away.  We kept looking, thinking that it had to still be there, but could not see a thing. After it disappeared, we realized there were several star-like lights, much smaller, moving very quickly, higher up in the sky in a tight circular pattern. Very shortly, we came to a train crossing by a small dirt road on our left &amp; pulled off the road and got out of our vehicle.  We heard multiple jet noises and realized that these 5 star-like objects which were moving very fast, were fighter jets, as we watched them for several minutes.  They  kept circling above, just to the left, where we saw the object, at a much lower altitude. My husband and I both agree that we have never seen anything like this before.  The whole experience as short as it was, is very incredible.  I called the Wood Co. sherrifs department when we got home about 30 minutes later, to tell them about the episode.  They said they had not received any other reports.  I am interested to see if anyone else experienced what my husband and I saw.

We noticed that there were many more (apprx 6 others) flying at farther distances all going in different directions.  We could tell they were moving incredibly quickly because there was a normal plane in the sky and the strange blinking crafts flew straight past it (we thought they were going to crash) and was out of our sight range in a matter of seconds.

It may have lasted 1 to three seconds. My first thought was lightning, but the sky was clear. My second thought was, someone had an extremely bright spotlight, but this was a pure white light. I walked to the front gate (my yard is surronded by a privacy fence)in time to see a rather large fireball with a long trail of sparks or burning debris and a long plume of smoke which lingered for about a minute or two. The last thought to cross my mind was a plane on fire and about to crash. The object appeared to be at 2 o&apos;clock high and about 60 degrees to the northeast. The angle of entry may have been approximately 10 or 15 degrees. It may have entered over Lake St. Lair or just north of Windsor, Ontario, as I am only 9 miles west of the lake.

I knew what I had taken a close up photo of, but everyone I showed it to back then either laughed, or llooked at me like I was crazy. I put the photos away and for years they just sat in a box. Then I saw the movie Independence Day, and it reminded me of my photos. I had three, but I have lost one which I believe would have been proof positive, since it was traveling away from me and not towards me as they are in the two photos I have and want to send to you. The location of the photo, was Fox Plaza on Hylan Blvd, near New Dorp Lane in Staten Island. I noticed off in the distance, three very strange looking clouds traveling in a V formation from northeast to southwest. If I were to guess their speed, I would have to say eighty (80) to one hundred (100) miles an hour. As they passed me they were almost directly over Hylan Blvd where the traffice was moving at 45 MPH. They were traveling at least twice as fast as the cars they passed over. As you can see in the photos, the direction from which they came had white and golden clouds, so these three very dark clouds were very out of place. What caught my eye was the violent churning of the clouds. The tops were black, whwile the bottom of each was flaming red. The bottom red part of the cloud was churning up into the middle of the cloud. To best describe it imagine a fuel explosion where a rising cloud of burning vapor is churning up and into itself. From the time I first saw it, and till it disappeared, the violent churning motion was clearly visible.  However, these three clouds never rose but did maintain a constant and steady speed, maintaining their formation.  These clouds did leave a trail which can be seen in the photos as puffy trails of smoke. They made no sound at all as they passed almost directly overhead.As I watched them I had this very erie feeling, and when they passed overhead at about a hundred and fifty feet, the hair on my arms stood up. I am sure that you can determine their speed since there are buildings in the photos. Please look at the puffs left behind, and the white clouds, and then at the UFOs, and how much they changed their shape in a matter of seconds. As I said, the inward churning of these clouds was very violent. I have never had any doubt since I took the photos of what they are. I only wish it were a motion picture camera I had that day so everything would have been recorded in real time instead of snapshots.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I looked to the west to see a clear, bright orangish white light in a stationary position above the tree line. It did not appear to be moving toward or away from me. I have previously lived near Willow Run and Detroit Metro airports and have not seen anything like this before. I could not hear any sound. I went to my basement to retrieve a fan as it was a warm night and is expected to be in the &apos;90&apos;s today. When I looked for the light again a couple of minutes later in the west and then in the east it was gone. I then wondered if this may be why my normally quiet inside dog was woofing last night?", "When I was a child ,I  looked up into the sky and saw a huge brown ball with spikes passing over.Note to Mr. Peter Davenport:  I submitted this old childhood sighting to a UFO site for the first time a few weeks ago, HBCC UFO Research to Mr. Brian Vike.  He asked me to draw a sketch/diagram of it and I did. He then invited me to talk about it on the Jeff Rense program.  They never heard a description like this before. Jeff Rense suggested that I send the report to you, that you have a huge database and could take one look at the diagram and know right away if anyone else ever reported a strange object like this.  I would love to know if anyone else ever has seen something like it.I didn&apos;t know how else to write to you except here on the report form. The following is my story.....  Well I saw something strange when I was a little girl so here goes. I was 5/6 years old, I was sitting on the steps of my front porch cracking pecans (wearing a red dress, white sweater and bonnet that tied under my chin- this detail given due to vivid memory). It was windy.I believe it was around March. I looked up and saw this huge brown ball with spikes slowly passing overhead. It made no sound. No lights but this was in the daytime. As it passed overtop (well,went behind the very top of) a huge pecan tree in a neighbor&apos;s yard, I watched for it to come out on the other side of that tree as it should have, but it never did. I then went right inside and told our housekeeper/maid Lillie, yes she was like family, about what I had seen. She told me that it was probably one of those new airplanes from New York because they were always making new things up there in New York. Over the years, I always knew that I had seen this thing, reminding me of like a huge beechnut (or sweet gum) in the sky. Not anything like UFOs as I would come to hear of them, it wasn&apos;t shiny or metallic, not saucer like, no lights, no sound. I decided to check out photos on some of the UFO websites a couple of years ago to see if I could find anything that would remotely resemble what I had seen and was shocked when I did find it, well something so much like it but I really couldn&apos;t believe it. What I had always thought of as spikes were being referred to by some other witnesses as &apos;tentacles&apos;. Along with the photos of it, there was a drawing/diagram indicating how the tentacles lowered downward to land in standing position. So this strange part of it seemed to make more sense. The one I saw appeared to have more of the &apos;tentacles&apos; than the one in those photographs, also the one I saw appeared to have outline of a door. Those photos were taken in 73,Cocoyoc Mexico. (and my sighting was early 70s also)   After all these years I have done a sketch of my sighting (thanks to suggestion of Brian).When I showed this sketch photo to my mom for her opinion about the old neighborhood part, she said to me....&apos; you know that&apos;s probably significant that you are mentioning that there is the field behind the house.&apos; She then said &apos;you know there were 3 adults at the top of the hill one night that said they saw something hovering over the trees behind our house back there in that field&apos;...... and I&apos;m like &apos;Mom, you never told me that!, how old was I &apos;? I said, and she said I was probably just a baby.  I thought it was interesting piece of information to receive all these years later. Another thing, it was not until I began drawing that sketch, that it ever occurred to me, that there was a huge fruit field all around the neighborhood, imagine that. I&apos;m attaching a link to the sketch here and hope its acceptable, I&apos;m not sure how else to send it.

About in 10 seconds later I witnessed the same flash moving in a counter clockwise movement. I called up to the bridge and ask if they had any air contact on there radar. They answered negative. I noticed after the bridge that the light continued in the same direction.  I estimated by the intervals in of flashing light that the object would be directlly in front of the ship.

The white sphere had no blinking lights what so ever it was soild white and was alot brighter than the headlights on plane. I continued to watch as they crossed pathes with each other, I was not able to tell if they were at the same altitued because the sphere was just in fornt of plane. As the plane went past me I couldn&apos;t see the headlights any more but I could still see the bright sphere as if it was a ball of light. The object continued flying south into some thin clouds.

Then it got into a thick cloud and I couldn&apos;t see it anymore , I stood there for a few more minutes waiting for it to come out the other side of the cloud, and it never did.", "Bright, bluish-white glowing oval shoots rapidly and silently across the night skyThe strange coincidences surrounding this sighting necessitate a rather long report. I have never before seen a ufo, and have always been skeptical of them, having felt that there must be mainly psychological forces involved in such experiences, rather than technological ones.  I recently moved back to Lincoln, and have been staying with my parents while looking for a place of my own.  Some weeks ago I had a dream in which an otherworldly craft flew over the house while I was alone on the front porch.  In the dream I called my mother out to witness the thing with me so that at least someone would believe what I had seen.  Then, several nights before the sighting described below, I stumbled upon a video of a 2001 press conference given at the National Press Club in Washington, DC by Dr. Greer and The Disclosure Project, and was stunned by the information presented there by him and his 21 government, military, intelligence community, and corporate witnesses.  This testimony shattered my preconceived notions about ufos--indeed my entire worldview--and forced me to admit that I likely have been a victim of disinformation my entire life. I was still reeling from what I had learned from this video, and was weighing telling my parents about it as we sat on their front porch on the night of July 21, when my father said &quot;there&apos;s a ufo.&quot;  He is a level-headed retired journalist who coincidentally spent years as a member of the National Press Club working as an award-winning White House Press Photographer under the Nixon administration.  I saw that he was joking about an airplane flying nearby, but his comment gave me the opportunity to broach the subject of The Disclosure Project press conference and tell the two of them that I thought it likely that we world citizens had been lied to for generations about the reality of extraterrestrial visitation.  It was a difficult thing for me to do, as I am a rational person and was risking my credibility, but I feel that this is supremely important information that everyone needs to hear. The three of us had an interesting conversation in which my parents expressed their own doubt about the official ufo story, and generally we all just soaked up this astounding revelation without waxing overly dramatic about it.  Some time later my mother went up to bed and my father and I stayed up talking.  Just after 11 pm, as if it had been summoned as verification of my earlier assertions, a glowing, bluish-white object about the apparent size of a pea held at arm&apos;s length, brighter than anything else in the sky, appeared about 20 degrees above the horizon (below the clouds) almost due south of us, glowing brightly and streaking rapidly westward at a 30 degree downward angle. I said &quot;do you see that?&quot; and my father replied &quot;I&apos;m looking at it&quot; in a stupefied tone.  The object (I call it an object rather than a light because it was a sharply-defined ovoid shape with no flames, rays, or tail) shot in a straight line toward the horizon and disappeared behind the buildings a few hundred feet south of us, absolutely soundlessly.  It seemed to be about a half-mile or so distant, though it was difficult to tell with certainty.  There was no explosion or flash of light at the time the object should have hit the ground, had it been a meteor, comet, or other sort of space debris. I asked my dad if we shouldn&apos;t call the local papers and tv stations the next day to see if anyone had reported anything.  The veteran journalist replied &quot;why would we do that?  They wouldn&apos;t tell us anything we don&apos;t already know.&quot;  A man of few words, he paused for a second or two and then said &quot;that was what you would call &apos;a classic ufo&apos;.&quot;  He later admitted he&apos;d never seen anything like it before.  The next day he joked, &quot;the ufo people were listening to our conversation,&quot; with his typical dry humor, but who knows--is that so unlikely?  Just two or three minutes after the sighting I took out my PDA and recorded detailed notes, which formed the basis of this report.

Sitting outside in lawn chairs catching up on eachothers day is a common practice amongst us.  I had been looking up at the sky when i noticed a silver metalic looking object in the sky above.  I immediatley jumped out of my seat and pointed towards the sky.  It sort of just hovered there right next to the cloud.  Now this shape is unlike anything i had ever seen.  It almost looked like three different circles combined into a solid shape.  I guess the best description would be the krylon spray paint can.  Imagine those three circles meshed into one.  My 5 friends sat there in aww of the event that was occuring.  My friends also being the biggest skeptics on this planet were also pointing and trying to figure it out.  We sat there and watched it hover for about 15 minutes, keep in mind this was broad daylight about 6:00 p.m.  After about 15 minutes the object began to slowly hide behind a cloud.  But it floated around the cloud and we never saw it again.  Now this is were it gets very strange.  About 10-15 minutes after the object went into the cloud, a all black helicopter appeared and went into the same cloud, almost as if it was chasing it.  The helicopter dissapeared into the cloud.  Roughly ten minutes after that event, air force one flew over the same area.  This was the same day that 520 bridge had been shut down, so the president could come meet with bill gates.  I have never been known to lie, and i can put this on my life that everything that i just described was 100 percent real.  I have seen many crafts in washington state,  but that was the clearest observance of a ufo.  Was an extra terrestrial craft watching the president of the united states?  Was it a daylite satelitte and a large quinsidence?  Or was it a spy plane or device used for watching us or the president?  I will never know, but that will go down as the most remarkable thing i have ever seen.  This definetley beats back in 1996 when a streak of light flew by sammamish,wa.  All of the neighborhood kids and i chased it down the street as well as many adults.  It was a 100 foot streak of light.  The news as well as the goverment alerted every one that it was rocket debri from space.

However, there was actually no &quot;real&quot; noise that I know of, and we were not in an accident, as I had felt.

It&apos;s important to note that I&apos;ve had similar sightings to this one two other times, all with witnesses.  I&apos;ll just put them all on this one posting. First Sighting:  The happened way back when I was in highschool, about 1988.  The location from which we made the sighting was in the mountains above Boulder, Colorado, in the parking lot of the Bald Mountain hiking area. I was parking with a girl I was dating at the time.  It was about 10pm.  We decided to stand up in the back of my car and put our heads out of the sunroof to look at the stars.  It was a clear night. Looking northward, we just stargazed for a few minutes.  I then noticed three stars that seemed to be in a perfect equalateral formation, about 75 degrees above the horizon, fairly close together (if you hold your hand out at arm&apos;s length, they would be about the distance apart of 1&quot; between thumb and forefinger). I just looked at them for about 30 seconds, and mentioned them to my companion.  She looked at them. Then they started to move in apparently random directions, each one in a straight line, only a few degrees, and then they&apos;d stop.  Then they&apos;d move again for a few seconds, and then stop.  Then they all started moving about &quot;1-o&apos;clock&quot; from their position, still in a clear triangle formation, but not equalateral.  They accelerated in that direction, and vanished. We were stunned!  We both saw the whole thing.  We were both totally sober, too. A year or so later, I saw a very similar thing, this time with two other sober witnesses, from the top of Flagstaff Mountain in Boulder, at night. Later, about 1991, I again made a similar sighting, this time with another two sober witnesses, while walking in North Boulder park at night. Geosynchronous-orbit satellites do NOT look like what I saw.  Neither do faster-moving satellites that move counter to the rotation of the earth.  Stars do NOT start moving and then stop and then move in different directions and then disappear.  I know that some people would say that what I saw were &quot;military planes&quot;, but that&apos;s not true.  They were VERY distant and looked just like stars.  Military planes do NOT move like what I saw.  I know that it&apos;s hard to determine distance at night (or even in the daytime) of objects you see, but I have a good spacial sense and I know what I saw.  These were NOT normal astral events.

Looked up from my desk through the window then open and then saw 2 bright white lights flyby away from me.So my line of sight of them was from the top of my window frame and saw them fly over and away from my house down to the valley and lost sight of them as they flew over some trees and dissappeared behind them. They were pure white lights which sparkled leaving a small tail of light behind them. They were the size of roughly a Soccer ball maybe silghtly bigger. They flew together about 2 meters apart fairly fast and smooth in motion changing altitude in relation to the ground.As they passed over I remember there was no sound produced by them. No sound of air or an engine.Its as if the air did not make any resistance to these objects passing through it at that high velocity. During this year 1997 I saw these same 2 objects once in the late afternoon as I was going home. I was comming up along the valley in the car and glanced at the skyline over the trees towards my house and saw these same 2 lights appear high in the sky and drop vertically down above the tree line and disappear as if they switched off there lights. The distance from me to the treeline where I saw the lights drop out of the sky and then disaapear was roughly 500meters.It must have lasted 2 seconds.They moved very fast and hovered over the tree line for maybr 0.5seconds before I lost sight of them.I had a close up of the same light but this time it was just one on its own.And I saw it as I was in my bedroom looking out the window to one of the trees in my garden about 8 meters away and saw this light fly by 4 meters from me and it made absoluetly no noise what so ever.As if it nothing passed by.It passed me at birds speed and was the size of a football again the same pattern of bright sparkling white light with a tail. It did not have any effect on the nosiey birds in the tree nor my 6  gaurd dogs whoose kennels lie below the tree. It was amazing.I never told anyone I know and kept it to me all these years because I knew no one would belive.I have never seen these lights again since and I have also spent little time in Kenya since but I will never be able to forget this.Surprisingly never did I feel threatened during these encounters or shocked but felt more peacefull then normal.I find that very strange as a natural reaction would be to be startled.I hope this account helps your records and may prove useful to yourselves.

A shooting star!&quot; But as I watched it, I realized it was too big, and too low in the sky and flying horizontally - this was not a comet or star. Also it had a defined &ldquo;shape&rdquo; to it.

We were traveling about 55 MPH.  My nephew, an aeronautical engineer, was driving my car so I could watch for elk on the highway, being the spring of the year.  All of a sudden the highway in front of us lit up for a distance of approximately a quarter to half a mile in front of us.  The light was a very soft misty light and for some reason it didn&apos;t alarm us, it just appeared.  Being in the passanger seat, I bent up over the dashboard to see what was above us.  What I saw directly above our car was a huge soft, round light about 35-50 ft. in diameter.  As I looked closely, I could see greyish metal surrounding the light but could discern no definite shape.  Then, looking directly ahead and just above the car, I counted seven of these round lights in a row down the highway.  As I was peering directly up above the car, the ufo suddenly made an elegant curving motion just above our car and in a fraction of a second was gone.  As it made the turn, we could see the individual lights bending as the craft went skyward at thousands of miles per hour.  The next moment I could see it far off in the sky with the lights in a row but the object now looked about two inches long and then it disappeared.  The craft made no noise.I asked my nephew not to discuss what we saw until we arrived home and wrote everything down, including drawings.  The only discrepancy between us was I thought the craft was about 100 ft. above the car and he thought it was only about 75 ft. above.The next morning, we went to the local Pagosa Springs airport and spoke with the airport manager.  He said his neighbor  had seen a similar huge craft hovering over his house that night.

The forward movement was in a straight trajectory and even, not erratic as one might expect from lighting.  It somewhat resembled a searchlight spot but, again, movement and rate of speed seemed inconsistent with that type of light.  Searchlights usually occur repeatedly over periods of time.

It appeared to be travelling in a slight zig-zag pattern and then stopped and hovered, I estimate between 5-10 miles away.  Shortly thereafter, a jet aircraft appeared moving very quickly and I believed that this might be an investigating fighter because of its speed but it continued right on past the red object.

To counter-act this energy i felt compelled even urged to go for a walk. I feel it is important to mention that i am well educated family person and,untill this day, had always been of very sound mind.As I made my way through my rural suburban nieghborhood, these thoughts moved on to how a man might need to find a means for living outside the human body, cryogenics, etc.. Then as if suddenly I had an image of a large park that was five miles from my home and got an overwhelming urge/belief that if I were to go there I would be visited by extra terrestrial beings. By this time I was so worked-up, I felt that i would definately need to walk there, just to have good nerves and a level head. So I began the long walk, this is when things took a full 360.Not even a block from my neighborhood I began to feel as though I were being followed, I looked over my shoulder to notice a black suv about 200ft behind me moving slowly. I immediately felt an overwhelming to evade this vehicle, so I then ran through the yards of the houses nearest to me to get to the next street over, and there i found another black suv. This time I made sure to look at the occupants and they were two men dressed in black siuts both wearing sunglasses.  At this point I have become so nervous that I decide to change course to a different park where I knew I would find some familliar faces, taking only routs through woods and yards so as to avoid being followed by the vehicles.Once I arrived at the park I began to describe the vehicles and the men to my friends; and as the last words came out, yet another suv fitting the description pulled into the park. My four or five friends then believed what I had told them, and one friend and I decided to go to a nearby payphone to call another friend to make sense of the situation. Now we took the direct rout through the trees knowing that the suv in the park could&apos;nt follow us there qiuckly. As we emerged from the trees we began to run across the road to the phone, when seemingly out of nowhere, another black tinted suv with two men in suits had to come to a screaching and swerving stop to avoid hitting us. We both had believed the road to be clear and were startled. So we began waving our arms and yelling at the driver of the truck, who was now only a few feet from us, yet he and the passenger coldy looked forward and drove away as if we were&apos;nt even there.for the next few hours my friend and I went from street to street attempting to evade the black suvs and sedans, who were everywhere we went. My friend eventualy decided I was in some kind of trouble and left me to deal with it on my own, even though I was clearly very distressed. I stayed in the woods for a while fighting the urge I had to make my way to the park I had orriginally set out for, for fear of these men in black.Then, around 1700, I decided to attempt the journey again. At this poit I was very exhausted, so much so, that passing car&apos;s exhaust seemed to be stealing my breath. There were no more black vehicles, yet I was now fighting the exhaustion. As I made my way up a paarticularly steep hill, I smelled the fresh air that sprinklers give off in a small subdivision I was passing and decided to head toward the good air instead of the park.I was found by a family friend about 1830 completely confused and exhausted, who returned me home. I needed more than a week of bedrest and relaxation to even begin to feel normal again.It is my belief that these men in black coerced me mentally so as to make sure I did not get to that park that day.

They came towards the me, and one seemed to be holding some strange, &quot;jewel&quot; encrusted &quot;wand&quot;.

The next evenining my girlfriend woke me up very late at night, terrified. She said they were back, and she did not want to do with them. Immediately I became aware of a very low frequency &quot;humm&quot; which was coming from somewhere outside. Here is where it gets strange, since it was a waking memory,and I remember it as a waking memory -- My actions that that point on seem bizarre and irrational to me. I went out onto the porch to see if there was anything. There was a VERY bright light shining through the trees that separated the space around the cabin from a large overgrow field. It was at this point I think the aliens, again, used their mind machine, or my own brain was just going into shock over seeing such a bright light shining from this isolated field. We were mile and miles from anything! The cabin we were in had no electricity, no water, and the closest neighbor wwas several miles down a dirt road. It was like my rational mind kicked in to convince me that what I was seeing was not real. I thought it could be some kids on ATVs, or we were hearing the sound of a far away generator, or that someone was simply playing a joke on us. From that point on I can&apos;t remember much. I don&apos;t remember going back to the cabin. The next day I woke up early in the morning and went out to the field to see if there was anything.

The objects were traveling from the south-by-south west to the north-by-north east. I brought this observation to my partner&rsquo;s attention. Our first thought was someone had fired a few rockets, but the altitude and flight path was not consistent with such an event, although the speed of movement was. We watched as the object covered a distance of approximately 50k with consistency of speed, direction of travel and altitude. We were discussing amongst ourselves what they might be when in an instant they came to a complete halt. A fraction of a second after stopping, all three objects blinked and then accelerated out of site (The first appeared to be in a very steep if not completely vertical climb). The second object moved in what appeared to be a level trajectory due east. The last moved in what appeared to be a gradually increasing altitude north. It took approximately one second for the objects to be completely out of site. We switched to IR and still had no visual contact. Obviously, we discussed the issue amongst ourselves but did not report it to higher for obvious reasons. We have no idea what these objects were and unfortunately where unable to determine a shape.", "Daylight sighting: silent, black diamond flies over Portland, OrMy friends and I were standing together and talking at the local dog park when I noticed a black object in the northwest sky.  It was moving to the south (over and parallel to Freeway 5, perhaps?) close to the same speed and altitude as most local small aircraft traffic (I am just a few miles from PDX). It was not what most would call a spectacle. It was black, had a diamond shape with four rounded edges and had no lights, no visible features (tail, landing gear, windows) and it produced no audible sound. The sun was setting at the time and the sunlight on the bottom western edge of the object produced a warm orange glow on the surface despite being black. It left me with sense that the object had a matte rather than a high-metalic surface. My friends and I agreed that the object was not a plane or a helicopter. We considered the possibility it was a baboon. The wind was mild and steady and coming from the Northwest. The object was moving more directly to south, It follows, the winds aloft would have to have been moving in a somewhat different direction than the wind on the ground - and I realize this is very possible. I could just about cover the object with the tip of my index finger at arms length. And from this vantage point in could most certainly have been a diamond shaped balloon. However, I would think that such an odd shaped object would be more likely to tumble through the air rather than glide. Nobody was particularly impressed with the event. Nevertheless, I felt compelled to report it on the off chance that somebody else may have gotten a better look at the object and needs corroboration.", "What looked like a star got really bright then returned to normal and moved across the sky.What appeared to be a star got really big and bright.

At first we thought is was a plane, upon closer inspection and gut feeling, something wasn&apos;t right about it. Then our attention was diverted to a new form. It was a glowing, blinking redish orange orb far off in the sky. We thought it was Mars but again something wasn&apos;t right, so we decided to go home and get a camera, and it began following us, and dissappeared 2 or 3 times. We then got the camera came outside, and from how far away it was, it seemed to have jumped a length of five miles around to our north.

I have noticed on numerous occasions (pretty much every night so far this summer) a light that when you first notice it looks just like a star but is moving, so I always assume it&apos;s a satellite but it acts differently than the hundreds of satellites I see every clear evening, I&apos;ve counted with my wife 15 of them in a 20 minute period going in every direction you can think. This star/satellite seems to increase it&apos;s light intensity 20X so that it becomes larger than any planet one can see from the earth and extremely bright, I&apos;ve noticed others reporting the same type of object and I am stumped to identify what exactly it is but once it has intensified it slowly starts to loose illumination and finally will just disappear within a couple of degrees of travel, normally I can follow a satellite for 90-120 degrees with no variation in how it looks.  To try and let you know where I see it most often is west of didsbury at about 30 degrees but I have seen them farther east at about 100 degrees as well.  We even witnessed one that was very large (instead of a pin sized light it was about the size of my pinky nail holding my arm outstretched.) that flashed in varying frequencies flying to the south heading east not intermittent like airplane flashers but more irregular. I encourage anyone reviewing this residing in the same area to watch the western sky as well as I mentioned it seems I see it/them every clear night I go out and look.

The weather was exceptionally clear, and no cloud cover whatsoever. I observed quite clearly a very shiny metallic object that was orginally noted as cigar shaped and it was suspended in the sky. The object was tilted from a one o&apos;clock to seven o&apos;clock position with the right corner situated at the one o&apos;clock position. Regarding the distances i.e. height and distance to object. I can&apos;t be certain but it wasn&apos;t close to the ground At the point where I noted the object we were traveling on Rt. 295 southbound right next to the Delaware river. That being said, the object was high in the sky in a southwesterly direction. As I watched the object it moved from it&apos;s static position to the right at a rapid speed without changing it&apos;s position, i.e. pitch, yaw and then the object moved straight up into the sky at a unbelieveable speed. As it went skyward I noted the circular shape and I distinctly remember a dark spot in the middle of the circle and a dark lining around the outside of the ojbect as it sped into space. I know airplanes and was in the Navy.

Have seen bright meteors in the past - but am sure this was not one. There was no streak, and the light was maintained in intensity throughout and the colour was very distinct. Could not judge height, nor distance from object, but it seemed to be moving well above the speed of sound. Even though the night is clear, there are no stars visible due to being in a built-up area. Due to profession (air traffic controller working on Approach at London Gatwick) I was able to phone to see if anything was picked up on radar - which proved negative. Cannot say more - apart from the fact that I instinctively feel that the light was something very out-of-the-ordinary (however, I do not believe in alien visitors) and is the first time I&apos;ve ever seen such a thing.

There was colored lights along the bottom of the craft. The colored circleted all along the bottom of it. The colors were green, orange, yellow, pink, and more colors I cant reall remember it was last year. I could feel a stange presence about it well maybe because it was a UFO.

The night was clear and cloudless with just the barest hint of approaching dawn on the eastern horizon, and an occasional airliner or 2 from Denver International Airport was visible far to the SE. After spotting 1 or 2 unremarkable meteor trails in the southern sky within half an hour, I was about to go back inside when I noticed a formation of 3 faint unblinking starlike objects in a triangle formation in the mid southern sky moving N/NE at about airliner speed. It was positioned &quot;backwards&quot; as it were, with the point of the triangle in the rear of the direction it was travelling. It also was a longer distance from the front two objects to the rear, giving the appearance of a long thin triangle.  Size was unknown but my extended thumbnail at arms length would just fit in each point of the group. Other stars could be seen behind the objects as they travelled so it didn&apos;t appear to be a single object. When the formation was almost directly overhead I noticed another starlike object, somewhat brighter, that was travelling to the south and which crossed the formation&apos;s path, although I don&apos;t know if the objects had any relation to each other and I kept my attention on the formation as the other object passed by. No noise was heard nor any other effects from the objects. After watching for approx. 1 minute the objects began to fade and I lost sight of them about midway into the northern sky. It almost seems like they stopped in the sky but due to their faintness that&apos;s only speculation. Further scanning of the sky revealed no more objects or meteors and the sky was beginning to brighten towards dawn.", "Roaring and erratic-moving lights over Henderson, KYOver the period of about 30-40 minutes, a jet-like roaring sound was witnessed by several people including the dispatch officer on duty at our 911 number.  The sound was similar to a jet engine, but pervasive, louder, and seemed to almost vibrate the house.  (It was loud enough to be heard/felt inside a well-insulated house with TV on, for example).  The roaring sound(s) persisted over most of the 30-40 minute period, but may have been multiple (up to six?) discrete events.  On about the fourth event, I personally witnessed a light moving from directly above me to the SE.  the roaring sound came directly from the direction of the light.  For the first few seconds the light appeared to be a fast-moving aircraft (I thought it was a fighter).  The problem is, it was so high that I should never have been able to hear the sound of its engines.  If a commercial or military jet had been low enough to hear, I should have been able to distinguish separate lights (wing lights, etc.)  I couldn&apos;t.  This object was just a white-to-maybe-orangish point of light accompanied by a loud roaring sound.  Before it passed out of view over my house, it veered dramatically left, then right, then left again.  I don&apos;t want to suggest it was spiraling, but that is what I thought at the time.  It maneuvered much faster than any commercial jet vehicle could have moved (in my field of view at the percieved altitude).  There may have been more than one UFO, as the roaring continued over about 30 minutes, either rising and falling, or multiple events in sequence.  I called the 911 dispatecher and reported the event at approximately 10:15 PM and she confirmed the sound, but at this time, neither of us could find a light in the direction the sound was coing from.  The night sky was absolutely clear.  I first became aware of the roaring when my girlfriend&apos;s son called me from across town to report both the sound and that he had drawn a picture of the moon because it had a funny shadow.  (That may not be related to what I witnessed.  I just note it, in case anyone else corroborates it.)", "Object moving in an S shape at a high  rate of speedAn object was sighted above the San Jacinto Mountains for only a few seconds.

It was a Wednesday night approximately 22:15 and I was working as a waiter at the Quonsett Poin Naval Air Station Officers Club.  We had just closed an outdoor steak cookout and were cleaning up.  The area was about 1/3rd the size of a football field with high strong &quot;ball field&quot; type lights on poles and other lighting on the building facing the yard.  The yard was bordered on two sides by high underbrush like reeds or canes and the area behind that was marshy the building on the third side and the pool on the last. Additionally the wooded area bordered the actual airfield, hangers and buildings. I was returning to the area from inside to bring more things into the kitchen. The doorway was on a slight rise (one level) above the picnic area so visibity was not blocked.  I saw this &quot;being&quot; walking away from the eating area at a moderate speed (no rush), pause a little before entering the reeds look ove the shoulder at the area and in my direction the immediately enter the reeds.  I do not know if I was seen as I was standing still and above the level plain with lights at my back.  I had been away from the picnic area 5 or 10 minutes before going back outside. I had made several trips in and out.  As someone else had been working with me off and on I looked to see if they had come out and seen the same thing.  I was alone. The &quot;being&quot; was about 5 to 5 1/2 ft tall thin, but not skinny and did not have an oversized head. Because of the lighting and location I did not notice any coloring. Everything was pale grey or dull silver. It appeared to have a one pc suit of clothing with no cuffs, pockets or closures. No helmet or head covering. The face was very human and I did not notice any head hair.  It was not carring anything or holding anything. It showed no surprise when it looked in my direction.  Just one look back over the shoulder, and he went into the brush. I did not mention this to anyone at the time as I didn&apos;t want anyone to think I was looney.  I checked local newspapers and other media over the next few days to see if anyone else reported anything or there were any reports.  I had recently been sworn into the Air Force as a Second LT. and was waiting assignment (in November 1971).  I did not want to jeprodise my future as a pilot with some big investigation. Some years later I found out the area behind the marsh also contained ammo bunkers and the Nuclear weapon bunker.

I am a cement mason, and I am famaliar with the sounds of different machines, and the sound is neither machine nor human.

I knew from the color of the light that this was no ordinary spotlight, it was a blueish color that reminded me of the new headlights on some cars but casted no shadow. Curious as to what it was coming from we all looked back at the same time and seen a bright bluish white light hovering (no sound) above the last house on Virginia AVE. which was less than 75 yards away. Before anyone could even think of something to say the spotlight flashed toward the sky and faded out as if it knew we had spotted it but the craft remained glowing.

I had a 3 month old in my house and my cousin&apos;s 2 week old baby was inside as well so now you can see why we were sitting outside on a cool fall, almost winter evening. It was almost dusk and about 5 miles away we could see something flying and it had a bright light so we figured police copters looking for drugs. It was very low to the ground. It is normal to see cops looking for pot fields around here and if they think they have a moving meth lab the copter is out too. So we were watching cuz this is a small town. We all know each other if we aren&apos;t already related to them or married into the family. And it happened to be over top where a lot of my friends and family lived so I was really curious.So here we are cracking jokes about which friend/family member it could be and It darted sideways up! Totally from the left side at the bottom of the sky to the far right and high. After we were through freaking out at how it did that, then it dawned on us what happened and we started saying ufo! And we came in and got everyone in my house to go outside and look. (of course we told them we thought it was cops and how it darted there in the sky.) This thing hovered. It didn&apos;t move. I tried to take pictures of it but I have a pretty crappy cam when it comes to taking pictures of the sky. Even when we have a huge full moon that is bright I can&apos;t even get a dot on my cam. But I tried anyway. It wasn&apos;t like the thing was going anywhere. I got a blurry spot in the blackness of the sky with these pics BTW. We had been watching it for about 20 minutes when a passenger plane started it&apos;s nightly route to where ever. We watched this plane go straight towards it and we were like, &quot;It&apos;s going to move&quot; and it didn&apos;t. The plane kinda moved around it. It was like maybe 30 minutes after that we had military aircraft flying towards it. The funny thing was we were like &quot;should we call the air force? call the police? call someone?&quot; and we pretty basically agreed no that if the military was involved they would say it was one of theirs they were testing or a weather ballon or something like that. What could local police do? And we thought if we called the local tv station they would laugh at us. So we just sat there talking and watching. Well here comes the military and we were like &quot;YEAH! Now it is going to get interesting.&quot; And we watched 4 air craft fly up towards it and go completely around it like they were circling this object of prey. It was as if there was an invisible barrier stopping air craft from getting close because we used the trees as guides and we could tell before they got to a certain tree they would go around. We watched the military planes for a long time play cat and mouse and finally the object moved a tiny bit. And then it disappeared. Now what I really found odd was the planes still could not go into the area of the sky that the object occupied. After the military left we came in and warmed up and that is when my mom told me she had seen the same object before from her bedroom window one night and she watched it for hours because it scared her. She saw it in summer on the other side of town in a completely different year.Well when we went out (we walk people to the door if not their car still here in the south) it was back, in the same place. My cousin says, &quot;They cloaked!&quot; He was convinced they cloaked themselves and hid. And we watched it for a minute or two but it was too cold to stay out there. So every little bit I would walk out my back door and look at it and it would still be there. I went to sleep at 12 that night and when I went to bed it was still there.A few weeks later, my cousin and his wife who were here that night and living in the same house my mom lived in when she saw the object that summer night, called me at like 6 am telling me they had been watching it stince about 2 am when they went out to smoke. And they reported they saw it two or three more times after that too.Plus as of 6-21-2006 they are still reporting seeing this object at my aunt&apos;s house.I will go in to my paint shop pro and try to make a pic of what it looked like-well the lights on it.

Around 5:00 A.M. saw from a north facing window, just overhead, at an angle 60 to 70 degrees to the horizon, and 30 degree east of due north, two  bright, unusual cloud-like objects. The sky was clear.  The larger object had a central section that was clearly glowing with rainbow colors. Long curlicues extended outward, mostly to the east. These crisscrossed repeatedly. Both objects gradually expanded, the curlicues especially extending over a large distance. Though the edges of the curlicues softened slightly over the next half hour, they maintained their distinctiveness, spreading to cover a vast portion of sky. The smaller object dissipated into a more cloud-like form, while the larger maintained its shape for a much longer time. Both objects were nearly stationary for several minutes, then began a gradual motion to the northeast, as though driven by the wind. Throughout all this time the ends of the curlicues appeared to be extending in length, creating sinuous patterns. The overall impression was of a &quot;chemical bomb&quot; slowly expanding and changing.

Note: the next day the news was full of reports that what observers had seen was the result of a successful antiballistic missile test over the White Sands testing area. However, White Sands is east of Silver City, and this phenomenon looked to be more to the north, over the Gila Wilderness area. Photos of this event were taken by the observers and others.

After a few minutes we both spotted another &quot;moving star,&quot; it looked just like the previous and was observed for around the same amount of time.

These moving stars may sound like shooting stars, though 4 of them did move from top to bottom as if falling, one of them moved up wards. Something I never encountered in a shooting star. And all 5 sightings were too long observed, and moved in a slow manner compared to a shooting star. Also, while moving these objects seemed to slightly change direction. They moved in a straight matter yet slightly changed angel as they moved. One of the objects at one point, seemed to slightly move in a zigzag manner, just long enough for us to confirm it with each other, as it then disappeared in the distance.

Inspection with binoculars revealed a sphere covered with a mosaic of white lights, some tubes, some bulbs.  This was about 10:15 PM.  There was a quarter moon, there was a high thin cloud layer with no stars in sight.   Inspection of the sky with binoculars revealed very many small dim lighted objects with the same features as the bright object.  Several times spheres blinking white and red moved fairly rapidly across the sky from south to northeast.  Only one, a white one only and a bit larger than the multicolored ones moved from NE to S.  A couple of planes readily identified as such passed overhead.  The most bizarre event was the appearance (I don&rsquo;t know where it came from) of a sphere with red lights, about 6-10&rsquo; in front of a fir tree on the other side of a grass seed field about 2-3,000 yards away.

I was standing at that bank of windows when, to my north-east, I saw two oval objects seem to rise together out of the trees in a nearby neighborhood. What impressed me were two things:  1. The difference in altitude remained very constant. The forward-aft distance changed slightly, but they seemed fixed to each other in altitude from each other. 2. Both objects looked identical, but with variations in color/configuration. These changes were seen in unison. Also, we have a lot of traffic to and from Ellington airfield, including formation flights of the local Air National Guard. These were most definitely F-16&apos;s as the ANG unit uses, and their relative position/speed was much slower than that of any plane at the apparent alititude. As for a description of the objects:  1. Somewhat oval in shape with possibly points to the side.2. The main bulk was white, the bottom black, and some red on the top surface. The shape and relative proportion of these features changed periodically during it&apos;s visibility to me. I watched the objects transit from their position along a rough vector west to possibly north-west. After Two minutes, the objects passed beyond the corner of the building. I was not able to re-aquire the objects in view after that. One more side note, probably coincidental: I saw flying along the same basic vector, shortly after the objects were obscured from my view, a small aircraft, possibly a helicopter.

It was particularly unusual b/c it was a beautifully clear afternoon in the spring with blue skys and wispy clouds.  I was doing yard work and scanning the sky for the local redtail hawks when my eye was drawn to a moving object far above traveling west to east.  It flew silently in a straight line and into the horizon of the trees.  Incredibly, it appeared to be camouflaged with the blue sky.  What was remarkable was I never would have noticed it in the sky except that the moment my eye caught it, it was moving over a cloud.  I saw a definite fixed shape and structure.  Even once it passed the cloud its outline was well defined although the blue color of the craft matched the sky.  It was shaped, overall, as a triangle, but its edges were rounded and the rear edge slightly curved towards the front &quot;point&quot;.  I suppose the &quot;boomerang&quot; description is most applicable, but its width was fatter or thicker than that word implies.  It may or may not be pertinent to note there were no lights beaming, flashing, or shining.

I lived in an area where all the houses where on 1 1/2+ acres of mature grounds, i.e. many large tree and bushes.  It was a very clear night and the stars were out in an abundance.  After walking for about 15 minutes we began to focus on the night sky.  When looking up at the sky both myself and my friend saw what we thought was a shooting star.  We both became excited because we both saw it.  Made the wish (don&apos;t remember what it was now).  Continuing to look at the sky we both saw another &quot;shooting star.&quot;  Now we were amazed at our luck.  Then we saw another.  We both looked at each other.  Wow, this was a crazy good night!  Then another shooting star appeared very soon after. I began to realize that each time I saw the &quot;shooting star&quot; I felt like a tingling sensation throughout my upper body, head, arms and chest.  It gave me the goosebumps.  I asked my friend if she felt anything.  She described the same thing.  We started to get a little freaked out.  We looked up at the sky again and another &quot;shooting star&quot; appeared, as well as the tingling feeling.  We began to theorize that maybe they weren&apos;t shooting stars, but a meteor shower, or what if it was extraterrestrials??  Our minds pondered over this possibility for about 15-20 minutes.  Innocently thinking what an interesting discussion to have on such a beautiful night with &quot;shooting stars&quot; or just witnessing a meteor shower.  Later we began to focus on another topic other than UFO based.  Normal teenage talk (I was 17 at the time).  All of a sudden a middle-aged man appeared right in front of us.  He was not more than 2 feet away and to this day I can remember exactly how he looked.  He had a receding hairline, wearing a red flannel shirt, jeans, kind of unkempt, and he was walking a short scruffy light-haired dog on a leash.  His hand was fully extended, straight out (no bend in the elbow) and the leash was perfectly straight (no slack) down to the dog.  Because my friend and I did not see the man with dog right in front of us until he was right upon us, we both screamed, jumped, and grabbed each other in sheer fright.  We did not see him until he was right upon us and it scared us to death.  After we calmed down which took us a few seconds, we realized how we looked like total fools by jumping, screaming and grabbing each other right in front of someone.  So we turned around to apologize for being so scared and &quot;girlish.&quot;  The man and the dog were NOWHERE to be found.  They had vanished.  They weren&apos;t in front of us, behind us, to either side of us.  We continued to look for him for a couple of minutes.  He was nowhere.  Then we thought it was very strange that a man who was 2 feet away from us, who must of obviously known he scared the sXXt out of us, didn&apos;t ask us if we were okay, or that he was sorry for accidentally scaring us.  In fact, we realized after the fact that he did not make one sound nor do we recall any movement of the man or the dog.  When we thought back about the incident we both remembered that the man was not walking towards us he was STANDING with his dog right in front of us.  Totally still!  My friend and I both swore we would never minimize what happened to us that night.  We knew there may come a day where we would blame it on our imagination, or that there must have been some other explanation other than extraterrestrial related (I  apologize  if I spelled that wrong.).  I am no longer in touch with that friend, but 20 years later I still believe that what happened that night was an encounter with an extraterrestrial being.  I have NO doubt at all.  I just finished watching- Dan Aykroyd:  UFO Unplugged.   He had a similar experience about a vanishing as well.  I got the same chills/tingling when I heard his story.  It just reconfirmed my conviction about what I (and my friend) experienced.  PS- There was no reporting of a meteor shower the next day.  I inquired, watched tv, listened for it on the radio (no computer then so didn&apos;t do the internet search), no mention of one. Also in spring/summer of 1999 I saw a metallic looking balloon hovering near my house very high in the sky.  It hovered for several minutes.  At this time I lived about 20 minutes west of Newark Airport in NJ.  I pointed it out to my husband.  He said it was probably a weather balloon.  He is a non-believer.  Again, watching the Dan Aykroyd movie about UFOs I saw the exact metallic shaped balloon in his footage as well.  After a while it slowly crossed across the sky and disappeared. I solemnly swear that the above did occur and it is not a hoax or a false report.  The Dan Aykroyd video encouraged me to document my two past UFO/ET experiences.  Hope it helps.  I always wanted to go on record with my experiences/encounter.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Triangular shape with lights in a V, no sound, very slow moving.I was driving towards my house and noticed a bright orange light in the distance barely above the treetops.  It seemed stationary as I drove toward it. I thought it must be a tower or a planet because of the orange light. When I got home, my yard faced the direction of the light and I told my mother to come outside and look at this light that I&apos;ve been watching for five to seven minutes. We came outside, and about five minutes later, the light began to get larger as it was moving toward us. My mother and I constantly asked each other &quot;What is that&quot; and we felt all giddy inside. I&apos;ve grown up near an Air Force base and have seen plenty of flying objects butntohing like this!  As it came closer, it made no noise.  It passed directly overhead very slowly, and had five lights arranged in a V shape on its underside. It never made a sound. It seemed to be barely above the treetops and bigger than a house by far.", "Daylight encounter with creatures that excerted mind probe at a distance .It was day light. I was walking home . As I crossed over on pershing there is a brick wall about five feet . As I approched it but still at a distance I noticed two colorful black and yellow , cartoon like , insect like creatures sitting on the wall . They were about a foot big . They saw me . The next thing I saw was a white background and faces with big black eyes . I new they somehow got into my mind . This was for an instant my guess . After that I was again walking but two other unknown young men that were coming from the other direction also saw them for I heard one say to the other , &quot; what the hell is that ? &quot; . I kept walking I just wanted to leave .((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "we were watching the fire works from my house, which on a decent sized hill, they are at about eye level when at a red object/dot was noticed staying stationary in the sky well above the flight path of a normal air craft, at about the point in the sky where you would point to if you pointed straight up, the slow flashing dot got smaller as it soon disapeared from sight, somewhat like a craft leaving the atmosphere. it stayed starionary and slowly blinked red then disapeared from sight after we watched for a short time. looked like a far away star went super nova or a somthing way up in the sky that stayed stationary then disapeared, let me know if anyone else in the san diego area saw it, it was odd.", "One triangular craft observed over the Rock River during night time. Near a local saloon between Rockford and Byron.  Object was seen by three observers, who were traveling south on Rt. 2 towards Byron.  Object was also seen near historical landmark and rest area/ boat launch.  Similar sightings near this area have also been spotted say sources. Similar in shape to a modified B-2A ATB bomber aircraft, used by American Military. The craft was suspended about 25 to 30 feet above the River. Two conical white lights opposed to each other about 45 degrees of an angle based on the crafts horizon near what may be the front of ufo .  One pointed at the Rock River, the other pointed to the sky.  There were around three red lights visible, with a possibility of five to six completely around the craft from the &quot;front&quot; to the &quot;rear&quot; of craft.  The craft was a dark ashen gray or black.  After craft was spotted it fled the area at supersonic speeds.  Unfortunately no camera or recording device was present at sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Dark Object with orbiting lights acting as some sort of fieldObject was first noticed 45 degrees above the horizon North-West of our location.  It was around dusk and with about 15 min. or so left of light we noticed a black object in the sky.  Object was first noted moving east and north (was getting smaller).  It stopped moving east and thats when we noticed a red light not blinking, but &quot;scrolling&quot; across it.  After staring at it for a few more minutes it was confirmed from multiple people all observing that there were flashes of light, almost like fire flies dancing around it.  It was hard to count since they were not constant in their luminescence, however we did note their patterns etc.  They seemed to be all around it and the lights formed a larger sphere orbiting around the object which seemed to be some kind of EM field.  Everyone confirmed they saw this sphere of lights around the object.  The object made a sudden arc of altitude as it moved west.  The arc that it made in the sky would be about the size of the moon or so (.5-1 Deg).  After about another minute or 2 the object became smaller as it apparently moved north and gained altitude and it was finally lost in the incoming darkness.  During the entire time 3-4 planes with contrails were all seen flying in different directions which all seemed to closely intersect with the location of the UFO. All parties agree to the aspects of the summary and were all coherent and sober at the time.", "two witness large brilliant ring of lights over Snohomish WashingtonFirst noticed bright object in sky.  It was the only object visible, remainder of sky was a consistent morning grey.  I observed it move very slowly. It was extremely large.  I went and awakened wife.  Together we watched it move for several minutes, when it became obvious it was not a plane, far too large, or a planet, movement lateral and then vertical to line of vision we went and got binoculars.  What a shock.  It was a huge circular shape with lights evenly spaced aroung entire circle and appeared sky grey inside circle.  At one point on top of circle  was a brilliant light ( what we were observing with naked eye) that almost gave the appearance of a diamond ring with the light being the diamond.  We took turns observing this for over half an hour. Occasionally the huge light seemed to change position sweeping over the surface of the circle. We also got a compass and lined it up with the object it was just a hair east of the northeast marker at about 60 degrees. Toward the end of the sighting it appeared to either break into two like objects or be joined by another larger but lilke object approachin from behind the first. It vanished quickly moving away from our vision.  Most amazing was its size---it had to be incredibly large!!!!!!!!!!!!  There may hve been some magnetic disturbance, we had a very difficult time stabalizing our compass.", "orange lights over paphos, cyprus 28th june 2006 23:30 local time1 orange light then 2 then 3 up to 9, entering into different formation ending in the plough constalation and then one by one dissappeared. some looked as though they were moving into one and other.
